And when run on CentOS 7, it may behave in unexpected way.

have run several times of YCSB tests, observed memory leak, it took me long time to track it down, and I found one serious problem in YCSB's code, look into all the test cases in YCSBWorkload2.java, all PreparedStatement instances it creates are never closed even when the statement execution is done, this causes serious memory leak, until the connection is closed or the process exits.\nPreviously, the PreparedStatement does not actually have batch ability, so the memory cost is very slow, but if you run statements without close again and again, as long as the time last long enough, along with more and more un-closed statements stay in, I can also observe the memory leak, just the growing rate is slightly enough cause no serious problem. I believe if it runs long enough this way, memory will be eventually exhausted.\nWith the new driver, because of the rowsets functions have much higher memory cost, the growing rate is much higher as well. But if we close the PreparedStatement every time once it's execution is done, I don't observe leak then.\n\nI think the YCSB codes must be updated, make sure the PreparedStatement instances are closed once they are done with their job. Driver does not manage to close the PreparedStatement, because  we never know when the user will use this statement again, it's one time prepared, N times execution statement.\n\nThe attached screenshot is one example of the un-closed PreparedStatenent code in YCSBWorkload2.java\n![31e7 tm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7919914/13523485/b439bf94-e230-11e5-826a-3cb1ad08a941.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/192210236/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/192316201","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/177#issuecomment-192316201","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/177","id":192316201,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjMxNjIwMQ==","user":{"login":"selvaganesang","id":8702996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8702996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang","html_url":"https://github.com/selvaganesang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-04T15:10:46Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T15:10:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":".Is the Singletonselect_stmt set to NULL everytime after execution.

In case of Select statement, the application can choose to call ResultSet.close().  If you close a prepareStatement, it is expected that the statement is prepared again.  \n\nYes. PreparedStatement is kept around till the connection is closed or till the user application explicitly closes the statement. YCSB wants to keep the statement around till the connection is closed. YCSB tests are not designed to prepare the statement everytime, because the execution time is very short. It is prepare once and execute many times kind of test.\n\nA well written driver, should protect itself even if the application doesn't close the Resultset explicitly. It should trigger resource allocation when the ResultSet close object goes out of scope and gets garbage collected. This holds good for Statement or PreparedStatement also. Trafodion driver is supposed to create weak references and poll the associated reference queue for deallocating the resources when the object has no other reference. However, that may not be relevant here, because YCSB tests are designed to prepare once and execute many times.\n\nYou can test it with T4 driver and check if there is growth in mxosrvr memory similar to T2.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/192316201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/192319102","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/362#issuecomment-192319102","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/362","id":192319102,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjMxOTEwMg==","user":{"login":"selvaganesang","id":8702996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDI5OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8702996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang","html_url":"https://github.com/selvaganesang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/selvaganesang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-04T15:21:10Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T15:21:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looks

all,\nI look more into this issue, and I feel I need to accept Dave's proposal as the best option to fix this issue. That is, fix current isHiddenColumn() 'len - 1' issue and proceed with it.  And I added regression test for this change.\nThe proposal made by Selva and Hans to use NAColumn method is good. However, it is very difficult to  implement. As far as I understand up to now, it needs many changes to current code.\nFirst, inside this RefConstraint::getPredicateText() method, each NAColumn object in the 'keyColumns' will NEVER return differently for any NAColumn::isXXColumn(), except the isUserColumn(), all other methods return false. The reason is: these objects are not properly initialized. \nThe root where these objects are created is at:\n AbstractRIConstraint::setKeyColumns()\nThis line of code is how these NAColumns are created:\n  column = new (heap) NAColumn(colDesc->colname, colDesc->position, NULL, heap);\nSo any attributes are NOT set at this point. And look further, where all column info is get from inside this setKeyColumns() method? It is from a class named constrnts_desc_struct.\n\nstruct constrnts_desc_struct {\n  char *constrntname;\n  char *tablename;\n  ConstraintType type;\n  Int32  colcount;\n  Int32  isEnforced;\n  char *indexname;\n  desc_struct *check_constrnts_desc;\n  desc_struct *constr_key_cols_desc;\n  desc_struct *referenced_constrnts_desc;\n  desc_struct *referencing_constrnts_desc;\n#ifdef NA_LITTLE_ENDIAN\n  void encode() {}\n#endif\n};\n\nAs one can see, there is NO information about column details like SALT, DIVISION, SYSKEY , etc...\nSo if we do need to create a NAColumn object which can correctly behave on isSaltColumn(), we have to change this constrnts_desc_struct.\n\nHowever, look deeper into the code, all information that filled in the constrnts_desc_struct are come from a query from METADATA table ‘TRAFODION._MD_.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS'. So I think we have to save the corresponding attributes like SALT,DIVISION,SYSKEY in this metadata table. This is complex and break backward compatibility. \n\nAnother way, is when generate the column list in the ‘TRAFODION._MD_.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS', filter out SALT,DIVISION,SYSKEY columns. However, this will have side effect which I cannot study out in a short time. If going into this way, the effort to solve this simple defect will be so insane. \n\nSo , I admit that creating a new isHiddenColumn() function have shortcomings:\n1. Itself may be incorrect, not well tested in all scenarios.\n2. it must change when SALT, DIVISION, SYSKEY name conversion changed.\n\nFor 1, we have to do more tests.\nFor 2, I add some comments in this function to indicate this issue. And I saw there is a JIRA TRAFODION-1852 that will standardize these names as KeyWords, so for compatibility, I assume, these names will not change unless there is a strong reason.\n\nGiven, all above, I decided to go with my original code and abandon the effort to try to use NAColumn.isSaltColumn(), etc.\n\nHope all can agree and get this merged. This is a real blocking issue for real customers. A not perfect fix , but better than no fix.\n\ni will commit a new version very soon,\n- fixing Dave's comments about 'len -1'\n- add test cases\n- add some comments for isHiddenColumn()\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/192894689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/192912627","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/347#issuecomment-192912627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/347","id":192912627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjkxMjYyNw==","user":{"login":"Traf-Jenkins","id":12548626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQ4NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12548626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/Traf-Jenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Traf-Jenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-06T15:15:17Z","updated_at":"2016-03-06T15:15:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"New
