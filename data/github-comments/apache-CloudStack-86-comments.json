The best practice when credentials are lost is to require that they be changed.  This approach makes the access to the sensitive information obvious to all users -- making it impossible for an attacker to hide such a breach.\n\nIn the past, we have removed sensitive data from existing API responses.  For example, for CVE-2015-3251, we removed exposure of KVM credentials from the [listHosts call](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/682).  Therefore, as a project, we have previously determined that security should trump API backwards compatibility.
