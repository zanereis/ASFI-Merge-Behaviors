No need to sorry, and I need to say many thanks for the maintenance of forbidden-apis.\r\n\r\nAs you see, I am still in progress of annotating the code to verify nullness (there are 3000 errors to be fixed), and then I would have the full set of ill classes, and I could either refactor them or do something.\r\n\r\nI do not think it is worth excluding ResultSetEnumerable from the verification. The reason for other classes are excluded is they have known forbidden calls which can't be avoided (e.g. the code is generated).

The good thing: it also rmeove the stupid cast, because Javac can't guess the lambda's types:\r\n\r\n[javacbug.patch.txt](https://github.com/apache/calcite/files/5162279/javacbug.patch.txt)\r\n\r\nIf this also fixes checkerframework, go for it! Actually this seems another bug in javac, because moving the type outside of the try...catch (see my code) does not help, but moving to a separate method helps.\r\n\r\nTo me this looks like a (new?) problem with javac and type parameters in combination with lambdas inside other lambdas. :-) This may be the reason why also Java 11 fails (see JDK 11 builds).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/685704487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/685706436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/1929#issuecomment-685706436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/1929","id":685706436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NTcwNjQzNg==","user":{"login":"uschindler","id":1005388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDUzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1005388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler","html_url":"https://github.com/uschindler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uschindler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-02T12:38:33Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T12:38:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry the patch file still contains my quick hack to let forbiddenapis run from a local JAR file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/685706436/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/comments/685928297","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/calcite/pull/2133#issuecomment-685928297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/calcite/issues/2133","id":685928297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NTkyODI5Nw==","user":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-02T18:46:39Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T18:53:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for your interest to contribute to Calcite!\r\n\r\nCan you open a JIRA for this PR?
