replay the log from 1.\r\nBut because log 1 no longer exists, FE will report an error:\r\n\r\n`Can not find the key:1, fail to get journal cursor. will exit.`\r\n\r\nAnd exit.\r\n\r\nThis will cause the electable group to hang up when there are only two FE nodes and one is down.\r\nAt this time, when the Master tries to write log again, it will fail because it cannot satisfy the majority of writes,\r\nand it will eventually down.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/785196915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/785272722","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/5321#issuecomment-785272722","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/5321","id":785272722,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTI3MjcyMg==","user":{"login":"Sunt-ing","id":43040147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDQwMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43040147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing","html_url":"https://github.com/Sunt-ing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sunt-ing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-24T18:14:32Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T18:14:32Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks!!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/785272722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/comments/785526007","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/doris/issues/5415#issuecomment-785526007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/5415","id":785526007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTUyNjAwNw==","user":{"login":"EmmyMiao87","id":25147274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTQ3Mjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25147274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87","html_url":"https://github.com/EmmyMiao87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EmmyMiao87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-25T02:18:19Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T02:18:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
