Might be something we didn't catch.\r\n\r\nAlso this reminds me about one thing: with the new logic, it is more likely that the scheduler will leave orphan processes in extreme cases, e.g. for some reason the agent process crashed(or got a SIGTERM) or cannot gracefully exit, the dag parsing processes will be left behind. Should we put a note somewhere about this? Actually we already have similar problem, e.g. scheduler process got SIGTERM.

Right now we have two arguments added to the public API. `filter_by_last_modified` and `last_modified_time`, where `last_modified_time` is set to the current datetime. What if we make `last_modified_time` optional, and if you set it, then it will be used. This will simplify the usage of the operator, since you don't need to set `filter_by_last_modified` as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/429514162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/429514276","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3893#issuecomment-429514276","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3893","id":429514276,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTUxNDI3Ng==","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-13T06:01:57Z","updated_at":"2018-10-13T06:01:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks @neil90 @kaxil.
