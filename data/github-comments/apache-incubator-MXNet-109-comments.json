Operator Registration\n\nThe new version of MXNet support operator registration via NNVM, the following code is a snippet on how an operator can be registered.\n\n``` c++\nNNVM_REGISTER_OP(abs)\n.MXNET_DESCRIBE(\"Take absolute value of the src\")\n.set_num_inputs(1)\n.set_num_outputs(1)\n.set_attr<nnvm::FInferShape>(\"FInferShape\", ElemwiseShape<1,1>);\n```\n\nThe syntax is quite simple, we register the operator via name, set number of inputs and outputs. Furthermore, we can register additional attributes of the operator.\n\n## Operator Attribute System\n\nOne of the biggest improvements brought by the recent refactor is the operator attribute system. This is like traits for types in common languages like c++. We can register arbitrary attribute to any operator, with the syntax\n\n``` c++\nNNVM_REGISTER_OP(op-name)\n.set_attr<AttributeType>(\"AttributeKey\", CorrespondingAttributeObject);\n```\n\nThen these registered operator attribute can be retrieved by the system later for various purposes. For example `FInferShape` attribute is used for shape inference, `FCompute<cpu>` attribute is used for carry out the actual computation on CPU.\n\nWe do restrict that all the attributes with same attribute key need to be in the same type. Other than that, we can register any attributes of operators. The more attribute each operator provide, the more information the system can leverage to perform various optimizations.\n\n## A Complete List of Attributed that is used by MXNet\n\nAll the operator attributes are listed under two files\n- [nnvm/op_attr_types.h](https://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/blob/master/include/nnvm/op_attr_types.h)\n- [mxnet/op_attr_types.h](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/nnvm/include/mxnet/op_attr_types.h)\n\n## Examples on How to Register Operator Attributes\n\nIn this section, we will go through the the attributes that can be registered in an operator. You can find examples of real implementations of operators in [src/operator/tensor](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/nnvm/src/operator/tensor)\n\nAn operator can have the following kinds of attributes:\n\n### Attribute Parser (Optional)\n\nSet attribute parser with `.set_attr_parser(PARSER)` where PARSER is a function with prototype `void(nnvm::NodeAttr* attr)`. This function should parse the arguments in `attr->dict` and store the results in `attr->any`.\n\nSimple arguments can be parsed like `.set_attr_parser([](NodeAttrs* attrs) { attrs->parsed = std::stod(attrs->dict[\"scalar\"]); })`.\n\nMore complex ops can use `dmlc::Parameters` and ParamParser (defined in operator_common.h) for arg parsing:\n\n``` c++\nstruct ActivationParam : public dmlc::Parameter<ActivationParam> {\n  // use int for enumeration\n  int act_type;\n  DMLC_DECLARE_PARAMETER(ActivationParam) {\n    DMLC_DECLARE_FIELD(act_type)\n    .add_enum(\"relu\", activation::kReLU)\n    .add_enum(\"sigmoid\", activation::kSigmoid)\n    .add_enum(\"tanh\", activation::kTanh)\n    .add_enum(\"softrelu\", activation::kSoftReLU)\n    .describe(\"Activation function to be applied.\");\n  }\n};\nNNVM_REGISTER_OP(Activation)\n.set_attr_parser(ParamParser<ActivationParam>);\n```\n\nThe parsed arguments can then be accessed in other attribute functions with `double alpha = nnvm::get<double>(attrs.parsed);`\n\n### Number & Name of Inputs/Outputs\n\nNumber of inputs/outputs can be set with `.set_num_inputs(n_in)` and `.set_num_outputs(n_out)` where n_in and n_out are integers.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of inputs/outputs is variable and dependent on arguments, you can set n_in/n_out to functions with prototype `uint32_t(const nnvm::NodeAttrs& attrs)` that return the number of inputs/outputs based on parsed arguments.\n\nOutputs can be made invisible by registering `FNumVisibleOutputs`.\n\nInputs/outputs can be named by registering FListInputNames and FListOutputNames.\n\n### FInferShape or FBackwardOutToInIndex (Backward Only Ops)\n\nNormally operators need to have FInferShape with prototype `bool(const nnvm::NodeAttrs& attrs, std::vector<TShape> *in_attrs, std::vector<TShape> *out_attrs)`. FInferShape fills unknown shapes (shape.ndim() == 0) in in_attrs/out_attrs based on known shapes in in_attrs/out_attrs. Use `ElemwiseShape<n_in, n_out>` for simple operators with uniform shapes.\n\nOperators that are only used for backward pass can instead register FBackwardOutToInIndex with prototype `std::vector<uint32_t>(const NodeAttrs& attrs)`. FBackwardOutToInIndex returns the mapping from backward op outputs to corresponding forward op inputs. Usually this is just {1, 2, ..., n_out } unless the forward op has auxiliary states.\n\n### FInferType\n\nSimilar to FInferShape, FInferType fills unknown types (-1) based on known types. Use `ElemwiseType<n_in, n_out>` for simple operators with uniform types.\n\n### Descriptions (Optional)\n\n`.describe(comment)` adds comment to the operator. Use `.MXNET_DESCRIBE(comment)` to add the current file name and line number to comment.\n\n### Argument Descriptions\n\nSet argument descriptions with `.add_argument(name, type, comment)`. This is necessary for operators to be properly called imperatively.\n\nFirst add NDArray arguments num_inputs times with type \"NDArray\" or one time with type \"NDArray[]\" for ops with variable length inputs. Then add float, string, etc, arguments with proper type.\n\nOperators that parse arguments with `dmlc::Parameter` can add argument descriptions with `.add_arguments(ActivationParam::__FIELDS__())`.\n\n### FInplaceOption (Optional)\n\n`FInplaceOption` with prototype `std::vector<std::pair<int, int> >(const NodeAttrs& attrs)` specifies which input/output pairs can optionally share memory. Each pair (i, j) in the returned list means that the i-th input can share memory with the j-th output.\n\n### FGradient (Optional for imperative use, required for symbolic use)\n\nIf and operator has gradient, it can be described with `FGradient` with prototype \n\n``` c++\nstd::vector<nnvm::NodeEntry>(const nnvm::NodePtr& n,  const std::vector<nnvm::NodeEntry>& ograds)\n```\n\nUse utility functions `ElemwiseGradUseIn{op_name}`, `ElemwiseGradUseOut{op_name}`, `ElemwiseGradUseNone{op_name}`  for ops that need corresponding forward op's input, output or nothing to calculating gradient.\n\nFor more complicated pattern, use `MakeGradNode(op_name, n, heads)` to create gradient entries, where heads are input entries to backward op, composed from ograds and n->inputs.\n\n### FCompute<xpu> or FCreateLayerOp\n\nSimple operators can register FCompute<xpu> with `.set_attr<FCompute>(\"FCompute<cpu>\", ...)` and `.set_attr<FCompute>(\"FCompute<gpu>\", ...)` for both cpu and (optionally) gpu computation.\n\nFCompute has prototype \n\n``` c++\nvoid(const nnvm::NodeAttrs& attrs,\n        const OpContext& ctx,\n        const std::vector<TBlob>& inputs,\n        const std::vector<OpReqType>& req,\n        const std::vector<TBlob>& outputs)\n```\n\nMore complex operators that has shared states between forward and backward can instead use the old operator interface by registering FCreateLayerOp with prototype `Operator*(const NodeAttrs& attrs,\n                              Context ctx,\n                              const std::vector<TShape>& ishape,\n                              const std::vector<int>& itype)` that returns pointer to an Operator.\n\n### Example: Absolute value\n\n``` c++\n  NNVM_REGISTER_OP(abs)  \n  .MXNET_DESCRIBE(\"Take absolute value of the src\")                                     \n  .set_num_inputs(1)                                            \n  .set_num_outputs(1)                                           \n  .set_attr<nnvm::FInferShape>(\"FInferShape\", ElemwiseShape<1, 1>)  \n  .set_attr<nnvm::FInferType>(\"FInferType\", ElemwiseType<1, 1>)     \n  .set_attr<nnvm::FInplaceOption>(\"FInplaceOption\",                 \n    [](const NodeAttrs& attrs){                                 \n      return std::vector<std::pair<int, int> >{{0, 0}};         \n    })                           \n  .set_attr<FCompute>(\"FCompute<cpu>\", UnaryCompute<cpu, mshadow_op::abs>)\n  .set_attr<nnvm::FGradient>(\"FGradient\", ElemwiseGradUseIn{\"_backward_abs\"});
