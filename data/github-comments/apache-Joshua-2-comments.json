That plugin took care of all the complexities under the hood. If you have proper setup, you can just go to \"JoshuaDecoder\" (or whichever class you want to run) and \"Run main\" (no need to package, because that takes time)\n\nP.S.

I wanted general opinion on the proposal but looks mostly people support it. Some things to take into account if that will go into master:\n- joshua-servet contains only basic functionality and does not represent a drop-in replacement for the [ServerThread](https://github.com/apache/incubator-joshua/blob/55e88d1fce0e2654d090c14d999e43acd6ac8820/src/main/java/org/apache/joshua/server/ServerThread.java) as of now. The idea was to get something working, collect opinions and extend if necessary.\n- The configuration of the Decoder supported only via `decoderArgsLine` init parameter. There are many ways to extend that (i.e. via system property). But I am just unsure which way is preferable.\n- Translation with request body payload now requires POST method instead of GET. Although that is more natural for the RESTful application, it might cause some incompatibilities with existing tools.\n- The artifacts for the corresponding modules are `joshua-core-<version>.jar` and `joshua-servlet-<version>.jar` respectively. This might require updating some bash scripts or tools with hard-coded artifact names. If that is the case, please list those here and I will look for the solutions.\n- Since folder layout also changed, above might be applicable here as well.\n- Probably the most important - after that change, there will be no more updates to `joshua-<veriosn>.jar` in the maven repository. We will have to follow this naming convention and support new artifact naming. So that is pretty crucial point and if we have better naming or modules hierarchy, we need to settle it before merging with master.\n\nBut if you are ok with all those point we can definitely proceed and merge. Thank to the git time machine we can travel to the past :). \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/227546904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/227619897","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/joshua/pull/25#issuecomment-227619897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/25","id":227619897,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzYxOTg5Nw==","user":{"login":"mjpost","id":455256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/455256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost","html_url":"https://github.com/mjpost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjpost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-22T01:34:16Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T01:34:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This passes my regression tests.

Collisions causing crashing in this scenario happen once in about 100k-250k translation requests.  This is a less likely scenario than just a state collision though, as you have to get a collision that gives you an out-of-range word id as a unigram.  \n\nWe've tested turning off state sharing between KenLMs, and indeed that also solves the crashing issue.  I don't think I know the details of KenLM and Joshua well enough to properly judge if this would be a better solution than the one I provided.  If someone with more knowledge then I provides a new PR I'll happily +1 it.  \n\nOne downside to just turning off state sharing is that we will still get collisions, we just won't get crashing.  I think if have collisions (even with a single model) we usually get an incorrect result (not a crash). \n\nThere are some other implementation approaches that could also be considered to fix the issue too (I'd like to hear what Kenneth thinks would be the best approach).  One idea would be to define a standard hash function for the State struct, and then we could use the State itself as a key for a normal unordered_map.  Then we wouldn't need this multimap.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/243442735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/243477515","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/joshua/pull/42#issuecomment-243477515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/42","id":243477515,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzQ3NzUxNQ==","user":{"login":"maxthomas","id":1263915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjM5MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1263915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas","html_url":"https://github.com/maxthomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxthomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T15:24:48Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T15:24:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"just rebased off latest master\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/243477515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/comments/243492518","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/joshua/pull/42#issuecomment-243492518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/joshua/issues/42","id":243492518,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MzQ5MjUxOA==","user":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-30T16:10:19Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T16:10:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Wow Max, great update.
