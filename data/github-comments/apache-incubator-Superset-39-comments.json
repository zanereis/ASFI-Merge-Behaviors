Perhaps there's something wrong with the branch/merge?  \n\nMy starting point was 'eca4694defa7'\nI tried to just simply run upgrade, which should have installed 'ab3d66c4246e', '3b626e2a6783', 'ef8843b41dac' and 'b46fa1b0b39e', but it hangs when attempting to install '3b626e2a6783'.\n\nHowever, running each upgrade individually, one-after-the-other worked just fine:\n`./caravel/bin/caravel db upgrade ab3d66c4246e`\n`./caravel/bin/caravel db upgrade 3b626e2a6783`\n`./caravel/bin/caravel db upgrade ef8843b41dac`\n`./caravel/bin/caravel db upgrade b46fa1b0b39e`\n\nThis isn't so much a fix as it is a workaround as I can't really explain what is going wrong with the straight upgrade...  but it solved my immediate issue.
