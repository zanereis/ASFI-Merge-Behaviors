It seems like the  mx.symbol.SoftmaxOutput() is support softlabel already and I just use a inappropriate eval metric at beginning.  \r\n\r\nAfter check the definition ,I think I got your point about using Kullback-Leibler divergence,my task is about video content classification,some video may have two label,such like 'dance' and 'sing', prediction is equally right for both label,so I think in this case cross entropy is good enough for the training.Now I have run the training task for a few hours, it do show the training accuracy increased much faster than use onehot label. I hope the final test accuracy is better than before.

This could very easily be tied to a flag on EvalMetric to remove or not remove padding. Taken from [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/metric.py#L87-L108) something like the following could be done:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef update_dict(self, label, pred, **batch_info):\r\n   if self.remove_padding and batch_info.get('pad', 0): # self.remove_padding can be set on the class, or passed in.\r\n      # do logic to remove padding from labels and press\r\n      # batch_info can also include the batch axis etc if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n   # continue on with this function as usual.....\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way metrics could either have a default to remove padding (most metrics would do this), and those that need to leave labels and data shapes untouched would be able to do so.  It has the added advantage that if `update_dict` is called without the batch info you get the default behavior.\r\n\r\nIm following this issue closely as it seems that metrics have been calculated __inaccurately__ when the batch size does not divide evenly into batches....","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/332302224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/332304003","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8017#issuecomment-332304003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8017","id":332304003,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjMwNDAwMw==","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-26T19:10:23Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T19:10:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's weird to install a specific version of cuda inside the install script.\r\n\r\nI'll mark perl gpu failures as ignored and merge this first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/332304003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/332306959","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/8017#issuecomment-332306959","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8017","id":332306959,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMjMwNjk1OQ==","user":{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-26T19:20:30Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T19:21:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@piiswrong yeah it's weird but is not weird that ldd libmxnet.so shows libcuda.so.1 as linked lib and docker container does not have this file ?

General idea is to pick whatever you like from the pre-trained model and weights and decide which weights should be fixed. Note that by default, all weights are retrained.\r\n\r\nIf what you want is to keep the same VGG  model structure but only modify the last one for which the number of hidden units is the number of categories (so two 4096 hidden unist FC layers followed by a FC layer which hidden units match your number of categories), then you would probably what to start the fine-tuning following the last dropout, something like: \r\n`drop7 <- internals$get.output(which(outputs == \"fc7_output\"))`\r\n\r\nThen, you can continue the composition of the symbol like for any model designed from scratch. \r\nHere the only two remaining elements as can be seen from the [Model Zoo](http://data.dmlc.ml/models/imagenet/vgg/vgg16-symbol.json) are the last FC and the SoftMaxOutput: \r\n\r\n```\r\nfc_final <- mx.symbol.FullyConnected(data = drop7, num.hidden = you number of levels)\r\nsoftmax <- mx.symbol.SoftmaxOutput(data = fc_final)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now train using `mx.model.FeedForward.create` and feeding it with `softmax` as a symbol. \r\n`mx.model.FeedForward.create` has parameters to specify initial weights of the model (arg.params) and whether some parameters must be kept fixed (fixed.param). If you want to have all parameters prior to fc6 to remain fixed, then you will need to pass the vector of these parameters into the `fixed.param` argument to that their weights are ignored during update. \r\nTo reuse the VGG-16 weights, you will also need to feed the `arg.param` argument. This will be the list of weights obtained from the pre-trained model, except for the final FC layer where you would apply a random initialization as illustrated in the cat-dog example.
