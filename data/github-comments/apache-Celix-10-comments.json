I committed the bundles from the release folder on both branches. I can inflate them, and they don't appear to be corrupted.\r\n\r\nIs it normal for it to extract to `.cache/bundle1/resources`? Is it not just `.cache/bundle1/`? Running `head bundles/celix_ShellCxx.zip` from the folder of the application does find the file. I tried running everything as sudo in case it was permission related but the same error occurred.\r\n\r\nThis bundle appears to be the only C++ one of those I tested (shell TUI and WUI), could it be linked?\r\n\r\nThanks again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1729978744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1730681588","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/643#issuecomment-1730681588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/643","id":1730681588,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5nKBr0","user":{"login":"PengZheng","id":5362947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5362947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng","html_url":"https://github.com/PengZheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PengZheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-22T01:54:46Z","updated_at":"2023-09-22T03:09:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Is it normal for it to extract to .cache/bundle1/resources?\r\n\r\nUsing your project, `bundles/celix_ShellCxx.zip` is extracted to `.cache/bundle2/resources`, which is enforced by `CELIX_AUTO_START_3=celix_http_admin.zip celix_ShellCxx.zip celix_shell_tui.zip celix_shell_wui.zip\\n\\` in the main().\r\n\r\nThe `main` of TestCelixContainer is at build/Release/celix/gen/containers/TestCelixContainer/main.cc:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#include <celix_launcher.h>\r\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\r\n    const char * config = \"\\\r\nCELIX_CONTAINER_NAME=TestCelixContainer\\n\\\r\nCELIX_BUNDLES_PATH=bundles\\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nCELIX_AUTO_START_3=celix_http_admin.zip celix_ShellCxx.zip celix_shell_tui.zip celix_shell_wui.zip\\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\";\r\n\r\n    celix_properties_t *embeddedProps = celix_properties_loadFromString(config);\r\n    return celixLauncher_launchAndWaitForShutdown(argc, argv, embeddedProps);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```Bash\r\nbuild/Release/deploy/TestCelixContainer/\r\n├── bundles\r\n│   ├── celix_http_admin.zip\r\n│   ├── celix_ShellCxx.zip\r\n│   ├── celix_shell_tui.zip\r\n│   └── celix_shell_wui.zip\r\n├── .cache\r\n│   ├── bundle1\r\n│   │   ├── bundle_state.properties\r\n│   │   ├── resources\r\n│   │   │   ├── libhttp_admin.so.0\r\n│   │   │   └── META-INF\r\n│   │   │       └── MANIFEST.MF\r\n│   │   └── storage\r\n│   │       └── root\r\n│   ├── bundle2\r\n│   │   ├── bundle_state.properties\r\n│   │   ├── resources\r\n│   │   │   ├── libShellCxx.so.2\r\n│   │   │   └── META-INF\r\n│   │   │       └── MANIFEST.MF\r\n│   │   └── storage\r\n│   ├── bundle3\r\n│   │   ├── bundle_state.properties\r\n│   │   ├── resources\r\n│   │   │   ├── libshell_tui.so.1\r\n│   │   │   └── META-INF\r\n│   │   │       └── MANIFEST.MF\r\n│   │   └── storage\r\n│   └── bundle4\r\n│       ├── bundle_state.properties\r\n│       ├── resources\r\n│       │   ├── libshell_wui.so.1\r\n│       │   ├── META-INF\r\n│       │   │   └── MANIFEST.MF\r\n│       │   └── resources\r\n│       │       ├── ansi_up.js\r\n│       │       ├── index.html\r\n│       │       └── script.js\r\n│       └── storage\r\n└── TestCelixContainer\r\n\r\n20 directories, 20 files\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n> This bundle appears to be the only C++ one of those I tested (shell TUI and WUI), could it be linked?\r\n\r\nI guess not. `celix_framework_utils_extractBundlePath` does not care about content inside zip file.\r\n\r\nFrom the following message, the bundle path is resolved correctly, but \"no such file or directory\" is reported.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"[2023-09-17T16:46:56] [  error] [celix_framework] [celix_framework_utils_extractBundlePath:217] No such file or directory(0x2): \"Could not extract bundle zip file `bundles/celix_ShellCxx.zip` to `.cache/bundle1/resources`\";\r\n Cause: No such file or directory\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the issue is not reproducible on my machine, I suggest:\r\n\r\n1.

My experience with VMs is that it is quite often just a bit slower and file-sharing between host and VM is mostly a pain point (how else do we get to use an IDE ?).\r\n\r\n> I cannot yet build the image, getting the following error:\r\n> \r\n> > Setting up python3.10-minimal (3.10.12-1~22.04.2) ...\r\n> > [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/lib/python3.10/**pycache**/**future**.cpython-310.pyc.140478821390960'dpkg: error processing package python3.10-minimal (--configure):\r\n> > installed python3.10-minimal package post-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 1\r\n> > Errors were encountered while processing:\r\n> > python3.10-minimal\r\n> > E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\r\n> > The command '/bin/sh -c DEBIAN_FRONTEND=\"noninteractive\" apt-get update &&     DEBIAN_FRONTEND=\"noninteractive\" apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends         dos2unix         git         locales-all         rsync         tar         ssh         tzdata         build-essential         ccache         cmake         curl         default-jdk         gcc         g++         gdb         make         python3         civetweb         libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev         libcivetweb-dev         libcpputest-dev         libcurl4-openssl-dev         libczmq-dev         libffi-dev         libjansson-dev         libxml2-dev         libzip-dev         rapidjson-dev         uuid-dev &&     apt-get clean' returned a non-zero code: 100\r\n\r\nJust for reference, the command I used was `cd container && podman build -t apache/celix-dev:2.4.0-ubuntu -f Containerfile.ubuntu .` (as non-root user) and the OS I am using is Fedora 38. I removed all my cached images and it still builds; so I am not sure what is going wrong here. What OS are you using?\r\n\r\n> This is also why I am not sure if we should add a dev container or dev virtual machine configuration, this requires us to maintain and document the dev container image and/or virtual machine configuration.\r\n\r\nThis indeed is true. Whether we offer a dev container, a VM template or something else, it needs to be maintained.\r\n\r\n> The reason why I see more value in a gitpod config or Github codespaces is that this enable users / potential developers to try out Apache Celix without setting up a machine or even needing a machine (browser based). So they could start coding with a minimal hassle. But also for gitpod / codespaces we should consider how much effort it is going to be to maintain the gitpod/codespaces configuration.\r\n\r\nFor me personally  I am not extremely content with more-and-more usage of cloud-based technology for these kind of things. The main reason is that only the first 'X' amount of hours is for free and if a certain amount of hours is exceeded then there is a need to pay said providers (obviously). Since I am mostly using my personal environment for this and doing this outside of work I have no intend to pay for these services.\r\n\r\nI am definitely not against having a codespaces/gitpod image, but at least there should be an alternative so we don't force people to use these providers if they don't want to (or there should be instructions on how to use it locally).\r\n\r\nMaybe we should/could even be offering multiple developer solutions (vanilla container, codespaces container, VM template etc...) ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1752110539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/comments/1752122387","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/celix/pull/656#issuecomment-1752122387","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/celix/issues/656","id":1752122387,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVuczs5ob0QT","user":{"login":"rlenferink","id":10008950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA4OTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10008950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink","html_url":"https://github.com/rlenferink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlenferink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-08T18:19:48Z","updated_at":"2023-10-08T18:19:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@pnoltes I just got the Gitpod image working as well, however it is a bit slow.
