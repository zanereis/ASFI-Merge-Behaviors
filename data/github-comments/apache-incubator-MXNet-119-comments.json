MKL-DNN trys to employ AVX2 and OpenMP to make things faster, and it will try to generate the operators' codes by using JIT at run-time. By using JIT, it could take some advantages by optimally hand coding some of the operators. It will be faster, but it shouldn't be more than 10x faster. \n\nIf it's really that fast on single machine, I am really wondering what is the cause.

As you write those methods, you should cast your data and labels into NDArray objects. For that you can use the mxnet.ndarray.array() function [3] to convert from numpy.\n\nA notable difference with generators for Keras is that Keras expects an infinite continuous flow, while mxnet expects a StopIteration to be raised after each epoch, so make sure that iter_next() returns False when the epoch is over.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n## \n\n[1] https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/v0.7.0/example/image-classification/train_cifar10.py#L81\n[2] https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/io.py#L99\n[3] https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/ndarray.py#L919\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/254549586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/254554242","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/3546#issuecomment-254554242","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3546","id":254554242,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDU1NDI0Mg==","user":{"login":"lincoln2010","id":3930283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzAyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3930283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010","html_url":"https://github.com/lincoln2010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lincoln2010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T15:59:48Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T15:59:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you very much for your reply.
