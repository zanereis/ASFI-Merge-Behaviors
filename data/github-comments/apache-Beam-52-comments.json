think that this is generally on the wrong path. Runners should not need to override temporal constants in specific transforms to get sane behavior. I believe the simple rule of thumb should be \"readers should return as soon as they are able\" + \"runners may poll advance() in a loop for a certain period of time if it returned too fast\" + \"runners must tolerate sources that take a long time to start or advance, because real systems operate that way\".\n\nI think we're violating all of these in various places, but that combined these principles add up to a good solution. Thoughts?\n\n(Also, if we reach agreement we should probably summarize to dev@ list?)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/254561071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/254564437","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/1118#issuecomment-254564437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1118","id":254564437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDU2NDQzNw==","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-18T16:33:38Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T16:33:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`ReshuffleTriggerTest` still provides unit tests for `ReshuffleTrigger`.
