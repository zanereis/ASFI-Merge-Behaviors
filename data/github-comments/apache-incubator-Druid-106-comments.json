To avoid adding Critical calls like lifecycle.start() i decided to go other way around.\n\nThe new way to do it is to have 2 classes (`HdfsKerberosConfig` and `HadoopKerberosConfig`) that binds to the properties under the same `druid.hadoop.security.kerberos.*` that provides keytab and principal. the idea here is to avoid having druid final user configuring 2 different things for the same end goal.\n\nThus, if the end-user is using the HDFS storage module. The auth call will be done by lifecycle stuff and that will work fine for all the CLI that loads pdfs-storage-module like historicals/MM/Overloard . \nIn the other hand if the user will be submitting hadoop job with or without hdfs-module, hadoop jobs will have to do the auth call once the new class loader is used to run the jobs anyway. The call will occur once the job calls ensurePaths.\n\nIn the end of the day user has to set the properties `druid.hadoop.security.kerberos.principal` and `druid.hadoop.security.kerberos.keytab` and druid will do the necessary auth calls under the hood.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/246124700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/246165069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2458#issuecomment-246165069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2458","id":246165069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjE2NTA2OQ==","user":{"login":"erikdubbelboer","id":522870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjg3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/522870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer","html_url":"https://github.com/erikdubbelboer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikdubbelboer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-11T06:41:48Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T06:41:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I just pushed a small fix for a bug someone was having and rebased on master.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/246165069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/246215665","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2142#issuecomment-246215665","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2142","id":246215665,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjIxNTY2NQ==","user":{"login":"navis","id":809395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/809395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis","html_url":"https://github.com/navis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-12T00:36:09Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T00:36:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@fjy Seemed not and hard to maintain.

But, I still wanted to maintain one endpoint, as users want that, to obtain all the necessary information, which results in so naive code.\n\nThen, how about tight timeout of contact to each historical node? or accept timeout value as a parameter?

Now, i have working \"cluster\" with two middlemanager and historical nodes.   \n\nonly one question, i have used cloudera as my hadoop distribution, and i am adding and removing nodes, very often, can i add new xml files to common when druid is working, or i must restart all nodes after each change?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/248193170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/248196087","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3466#issuecomment-248196087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3466","id":248196087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODE5NjA4Nw==","user":{"login":"nishantmonu51","id":5023786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjM3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5023786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51","html_url":"https://github.com/nishantmonu51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nishantmonu51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-20T04:05:39Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T04:05:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I believe you need not restart your middlemanagers, It should get picked up for the new tasks since each task is a separate VM. \nTo make things more cleaner, You can also use the classpathPrefix property in the task and have versioned configs for your directoryStructure. \ne.g. you can have a directory structure hadoopConfigs/v1 and when you make a change create a new directory hadoopConfigs/v2. and point new tasks to use the new classpath by setting classpathPrefix to hadoopConfigs/v2.
