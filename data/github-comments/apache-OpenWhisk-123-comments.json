Attaching attachment requires the document to be present - Its not possible to upload an attachment and then link to the document. So for initial creation we need to first create the document\r\n2. Updating document post attach causes the attachment to be lost - If a document with attachment is updated later then attachment gets lost. Looks like one needs to [pass in a stub][1] of attachment for such an update to work\r\n    > When you want to update the document (e.g. through PUT) you must include the \"stub\", otherwise Couch will remove the attachment.\r\n\r\nGiven these limitation it looks like we cannot implement proposed logic in a generic way. For now I see following option\r\n\r\n#### A - Store specific flow in DocumentFactory\r\n\r\nUse current approach when just `CouchDBRestStore` is configured and use the proposed approch when any other `AttachmentStore` is configured\r\n\r\n##### Pros\r\n\r\nNot that major change in current design\r\n\r\n##### Cons\r\n\r\nArtfactStore client need to become aware of internal capabilities to make use of its features\r\n\r\n#### B - Introduce a new method in ArtifactStore\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to be add another method in ArtifactStore\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  protected[database] def putAndAttach[A <: DocumentAbstraction](\r\n    d: A,\r\n    update: (A, Attached) => A,\r\n    contentType: ContentType,\r\n    docStream: Source[ByteString, _],\r\n    oldAttachment: Option[Attached])(implicit transid: TransactionId): Future[(DocInfo, Attached)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n* `attachedUpdater` - Method which would update the `DocumentAbstraction` with new attachment details\r\n* `oldAttached` - Details about old attachment. We can also just accept an attachmentName string also here\r\n\r\nSuch a method can then be efficiently implemented by respective `ArtifactStore`  for e.g. with\r\n* `CouchDBRestStore`\r\n    1. Generate a random name\r\n    2. Update the DocumentAbstraction and save it\r\n    3. Now attach the passed source with generated name\r\n    4. No need for deleting old attachment as post document update CouchDB would not remember it anyway\r\n* `CouchDBRestStore` + `S3AttachmentStore`\r\n    1. Generate a random name and then upload to S3 with generated name\r\n    2. Update the DocumentAbstraction and save it\r\n    3. Delete the old attachment\r\n\r\n##### Cons\r\n\r\nThis restricts the attachment support to 1-1 mapping i.e. one attachment per document. So far the usecases are like this only. So it may be ok\r\n\r\n##### Pros\r\n\r\nAllows each `ArtifactStore` to handle attachment in efficient way as per its capabilities. For e.g. the proposed generic approach would have involved 3 calls for Couch but this approach can get same done in 2 calls.\r\n\r\n@rabbah @markusthoemmes Any thoughts on which approach to take\r\n\r\n[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/34325095/1035417","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/376980658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/377084035","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3421#issuecomment-377084035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3421","id":377084035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzA4NDAzNQ==","user":{"login":"dubee","id":11520887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11520887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee","html_url":"https://github.com/dubee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dubee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T00:41:33Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T00:41:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"PG4 1539 🔵 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/377084035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/377093174","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/2795#issuecomment-377093174","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/2795","id":377093174,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzA5MzE3NA==","user":{"login":"upgle","id":5635513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzU1MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5635513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle","html_url":"https://github.com/upgle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upgle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T01:41:00Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T01:41:00Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"How is it coming along?

(Contianers are reused only if namespace and action name are same.)\r\nSince performance of docker daemon is not good, it causes TPS dropping.\r\n​\r\nWhen one of my colleagues did benchmark against Docker daemon directly, we observed only 30 \r\n~ 40 TPS with `pause/unpause`.\r\n(He also performed similar `pause/unpause` test with runc and only got about 300 TPS.)\r\nWhen we included `run/rm` as well, TPS dropped to 1 ~ 10 TPS.\r\n\r\nIt means if containers are not reused well, it makes dockerd create/remote/unpause/pause containers and TPS is dropped due to poor performance of docker daemon.\r\nI think this issue exists in all serverless frameworks which are based on docker.\r\n\r\nSo docker daemon is surely performance bottleneck in OpenWhisk, and it's not that simple to resolve it.\r\nEven though huge performance improvement is made on docker daemon, I doubt it can support more than 1K ~ 2K TPS.\r\n(Because docker is not designed to support this kind of traffic, creating about 1K containers in a second is not that plausible.)\r\n​\r\n\r\nThen, in OpenWhisk, main key factor of performance is reuse of containers, in other word, reducing loads to docker daemon.\r\nWith 1 actions, there were not many docker traffics, invoker just called `/run` requests against running containers again and again.\r\nHowever, with 100 actions, many containers should be deleted and created, this caused huge performance degradation.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reuse rate: 95%**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3447251/38071348-b4e5fe8e-335b-11e8-827f-42e30cb2adc5.png)\r\n\r\nIn above graph, the red part in a circle is the ratio of reused(warmed) containers.\r\nReuse rate was more than 95%, but I got only 6K TPS.\r\n\r\n**5 namespaces + 2 actions each with 100 threads**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3447251/38071350-baa4245e-335b-11e8-82cd-94ad78f12cf1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs reuse rate is decreased, TPS is getting worse.\r\n\r\n**Reuse rate: 60%**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3447251/38071353-be222eaa-335b-11e8-9a04-de64b6ce1826.png)\r\n\r\n**10 namespaces + 10 actions each with 400 threads**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3447251/38071358-c4e77998-335b-11e8-8d51-4edaebb1d554.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n​\r\nI changed `ContinerProxy` code to reuse container based on runtime and container memory size, and also changed `gracePause` time to 10 mins.\r\nSo once container is created, it is not paused in 10 minutes. No matter requests come from any namespaces, if runtime and memory size are same, containers are reused.\r\nAnd I got about 20K TPS back with this changes.\r\n\r\n**100 actions with 740 threads**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3447251/38071362-c89b0474-335b-11e8-8078-b394e91f2d1a.png)\r\n\r\n​\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere could be some side effects and hidden defects of this implementation.\r\nBut anyway I got about 20K TPS with 100 actions.\r\nThis is because all 100 actions are nodejs6 actions and require same container memory size, accordingly all containers are reused.\r\n\r\nIn current code, TPS is decreased as the number of actions or number of namespaces are increasing.\r\nSince there is no limit on the number of namespaces and the number of actions in them, more and more namespace and actions are used, performance is getting worse.\r\n\r\nWith this change, now container reuse rate only depends on runtime and container memory size.\r\nOpenWhisk has 6 runtimes(nodejs6, nodejs8, python, php, swift, java), it can vastly increase reuse rate.\r\nAnd even if more and more actions and namespaces are created, there is no performance degradation if same runtime is used.\r\n\r\n One more good thing of this implementation is, it reduces the traffic against dockerd, I could run benchmark for long-term without any docker daemon problem under heavy loads.\r\n\r\nSince I am not that an expert on OpenWhisk, I want to discuss whether there could be any issues or side effects with this change.\r\nWith my shallow understanding on OpenWhisk, one security issue could happen when user accesses files in a container. \r\nIf user creates any files in the code, files could be exposed to other users as same container can be reused among many users.\r\n(But I am not sure OpenWhisk should also guarantee such kinds of stateful approach because serverless is intrinsically stateless.)\r\nOther than that, I have no idea currently.\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from my suggestion, I think one more thing worth to try is this one:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/2795\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to listen any opinions and feedback.\r\nThanks in advance","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/377126909/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/377204137","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3502#issuecomment-377204137","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3502","id":377204137,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzIwNDEzNw==","user":{"login":"chetanmeh","id":664531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDUzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/664531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh","html_url":"https://github.com/chetanmeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chetanmeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T11:19:24Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T11:19:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@rabbah  This is initial implementation of approach B (#3500) to check if this looks worth pursuing.

The container can be entirely tainted where traffic is snooped, secrets stolen, and even the code itself.\r\n\r\nThe container isolation in place today also serves another purpose: isolating bugs related to concurrency.  If your JavaScript code doesn’t properly handle asynchronous callbacks, you might have many actions running at once across different functions. So beyond security implications there will be performance isolation that’s also risked.\r\n\r\nThat said, https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/2795 from @tysonnorris increases intra-container concurrency to reduce the load on the docker daemon. Further, creating more stem cells containers ahead of time is another way to avoid docker runs.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/377788654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/comments/377828506","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/pull/3504#issuecomment-377828506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/3504","id":377828506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzgyODUwNg==","user":{"login":"tysonnorris","id":1638396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzgzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1638396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris","html_url":"https://github.com/tysonnorris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tysonnorris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-02T00:25:19Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T00:25:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So do you recommend `adoptopenjdk/openjdk8:jdk8u152-b16-alpine` or `adoptopenjdk/openjdk8-openj9:jdk8u162-b12_openj9-0.8.0-alpine`?
