I've given more analysis to the internal classpath editing from 2.10 and I don't see any potential side effects from appending to the existing merged classpath.\n\nIn terms of Spark moving to 2.11(.3 or higher) in the future, one option would be to simply include a trait mixed in with global that keeps the functionality they removed. From what I've seen, the only reason they removed it was because it wasn't used in the compiler or sbt, not that it had any issues. The underlying functionality wasn't broken, so I don't see any harm in doing that as a backup.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52309557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52309962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1969#issuecomment-52309962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1969","id":52309962,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzA5OTYy","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-15T14:13:46Z","updated_at":"2014-08-15T14:13:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I

We established that, for standalone mode, we don't need to ship the driver's spark home to the executors, which may not use the same spark home. Instead, we should just use the `Worker`'s current working directory. However, I am not familiar enough with Mesos to comment on the need of shipping `SPARK_HOME` there.\n\n@iven There are many other places where we export `SPARK_HOME` in addition to these two. From a quick grep, I found the following:\n\n```\nbin/pyspark:export SPARK_HOME=\"$FWDIR\"\nbin/run-example:export SPARK_HOME=\"$FWDIR\"\nbin/spark-class:export SPARK_HOME=\"$FWDIR\"\nbin/spark-submit:export SPARK_HOME=\"$(cd `dirname $0`/..; pwd)\"\nsbin/spark-config.sh:export SPARK_HOME=${SPARK_PREFIX}\n```\n\nWe need to do the same for all of these places in order for your intended behavior to take effect. In the longer run, however, we should just clean up our usages of `SPARK_HOME`, since in many places we don't actually have any need to export it (or even use the variable `SPARK_HOME`).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52348177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/52348403","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1946#issuecomment-52348403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/1946","id":52348403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzQ4NDAz","user":{"login":"pwendell","id":320616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/320616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell","html_url":"https://github.com/pwendell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwendell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-15T19:33:56Z","updated_at":"2014-08-15T19:33:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I do agree with @mridulm it's a somewhat risky change so I think it's out of scope to put it in 1.1.
