Since `read_namespaced_pod_log` is called with `follow=True`, this triggers a `keepalive` connection from the client to the Kubernetes API in order to stream logs. Digging into the urllib3 code, we found it uses a generator to \"stream\" the logs from Kubernetes API back to the client. Adding a timeout here would/could cause several things to happen:\r\n\r\n(1) tasks that use the KubernetesPodOperator and run longer than the specified `kube_api_timeout_seconds` would always trigger the timeout to happen\r\n(2) when the timeout happens, either:\r\n  a. an exception happens, a retry to read the pod logs happens, and logs are duplicated\r\n  b. urllib3 does not respect the timeout on a `keepalive` connection\r\n\r\n@rolanddb Replying to your comment above, yes, we also observe the same behavior. However, having the worker pods retry ad infinitum may lead to repeated and confusing logs, which defeats the purpose of having the logs. I'm also not quite sure what you mean when you say `poll indefinitely for the status of launched tasks` as `read_namespaced_pod_log` reads logs, not the state of the task pod itself. If `read_namespaced_pod_log` is where the hanging occurs, this PR will not address that specific issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/527636364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/527638460","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5924#issuecomment-527638460","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5924","id":527638460,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzYzODQ2MA==","user":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T21:02:02Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T21:02:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@nuclearpinguin Can you do rebased?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/527638460/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/527652260","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5135#issuecomment-527652260","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5135","id":527652260,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzY1MjI2MA==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T21:42:23Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T21:42:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

(We need to sanitize the dag we were using a bit before testing it)\r\n\r\nSecondly something was taking a long time (about 4 seconds per dag) to call `Serialization.from_json` which was... slow. So we ran it through py-spy and got this flame graph:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2019-09-04 Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34150/64276885-e21e3d80-cf40-11e9-88ac-fe396f609748.png)\r\n\r\n(Calls go from top, to bottom, the wider the bar the more time spent in a function or it's children)\r\n\r\nThis shows us that we spent 43% of the time parsing dates! Oops!\r\n\r\nA bit of benchmarking of different parsing/storage methods\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [39]: %timeit dateutil.parser.parse(json.loads('\"2019-09-04T17:57:59.869630+00:00\"'))\r\n158 µs ± 15 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [23]: %timeit pendulum.parse(json.loads('\"2019-09-04T17:57:59.869630+00:00\"'))\r\n32.6 µs ± 2.36 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [24]: %timeit datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(json.loads(\"1567616279.86963\"))\r\n4.91 µs ± 169 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [25]: %timeit datetime.datetime(*json.loads(\"[2019, 9, 4, 17, 57, 59, 869630]\"))\r\n5.47 µs ± 394 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [27]: %timeit pendulum.fromtimestamp(json.loads(\"1567616279.86963\"))\r\n42.6 µs ± 3.09 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [28]: %timeit pendulum.from_timestamp(json.loads(\"1567616279.86963\"))\r\n14.5 µs ± 1.11 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [29]: %timeit pendulum.from_timestamp(json.loads(\"1567616279.86963\"))\r\n14.5 µs ± 571 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [30]: %timeit pendulum.fromtimestamp(json.loads(\"1567616279.86963\"))\r\n44.4 µs ± 9.43 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo storing dates as fractional-seconds since the epoch and using `pendulum.from_timestamp` (but not `pendulum.fromtimestamp`!) will cut the parsing time from dates by a factor of 10 (158 µs ± 15 µs down to  14.5 µs ± 0.5 µs) which seems well worth it.\r\n\r\nThe other thing to look at might be to store fewer dates. For instance I think (but haven't checked) that we are storing the start_date against the dag and against each and every operator -- we don't need to store it against the operators if it is the same value.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/528002396/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/528035557","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5189#issuecomment-528035557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5189","id":528035557,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODAzNTU1Nw==","user":{"login":"ArgentFalcon","id":3519697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTk2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3519697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon","html_url":"https://github.com/ArgentFalcon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArgentFalcon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-04T18:51:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-04T18:51:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm not sure that this actually fixes the issue, because it doesn't propogate the skip state, which is the issue I've generally seen.

the PR to convert datetime object to timestamp and parsing timestamp using `pendulum.from_timestamp(var)` (instead of parsing date from `dateutil.parser.parse`).\r\n\r\nThis decreased the time by a good amount.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/64392409-948af900-d044-11e9-8c68-7bc3f811af2e.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, the time taken with DAG Serialisation is still more than parsing DAG files.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBenchmarking after optimsing datetime parsing issue above:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/64390970-d022c480-d03e-11e9-8b09-6def5c749472.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can fetching DAGs from DB is still taking more time than parsing DAGs from files.\r\n\r\nThe flame graphs below show that a good amount of time is spent in loading the json (`json.loads`) into a Python dictionary.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/64391671-8e474d80-d041-11e9-817f-ebe7e18e7dc8.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/64391684-a4550e00-d041-11e9-80a8-9679e0dc6b72.png)\r\n\r\nSo we have 2 solutions:\r\n\r\n(1) Replace `json` package with a faster json-parsing package.\r\nMany online benchmark showed that the `json` package is relatively slow. Based on that I carried out benchmarks of few popular json packages for our use-case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport json\r\nimport yajl\r\nimport ujson\r\n\r\nIn [21]: %timeit -n100 json.loads(testLoad74_w_json)\r\n100 loops, best of 3: 25.5 ms per loop\r\n\r\nIn [20]: %timeit -n100 yajl.loads(testLoad74_w_json)\r\n100 loops, best of 3: 11.2 ms per loop\r\n\r\nIn [22]: %timeit -n100 ujson.loads(testLoad74_w_json)\r\n100 loops, best of 3: 9.67 ms per loop\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the above results I will change `json.loads` to `ujson.loads` and bechmark again. Will post the results tomorrow.\r\n\r\n(2) Reduce the number of fields that we store in DB even further.\r\nThe current size of 1 of our test Serialized DAG is ~1.95 mb\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/64391980-b5524f00-d042-11e9-8c1a-1190882a31f1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/528654768/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/528661987","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5999#issuecomment-528661987","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5999","id":528661987,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODY2MTk4Nw==","user":{"login":"ryanyuan","id":7124535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQ1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7124535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T00:47:06Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T00:47:06Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I found this issue when I was browsing this airflow doc using my mobile.

Not having to loads json from str and vice-versa seemed to have halved the time needed to de-serialized dags.\r\n\r\nBasically, when we use JSON columns, we no longer require to convert json to str when writing it to DB as Sqlalchemy does that for us, it can write a python dict as json object directly.

With aggregated query the DB CPU usage is kept under 50% while with the subprocess query the DB will be killed instantly. In our production cluster at that time, running ~20k tasks concurrently with 2k DAG files, DB CPU went from 80% to ~40%. In our current production DB with >23M rows in task_instance table and >4M rows in job table, average time it takes to run the query takes 0.5 second( we have a powerful DB but the PR being reverted also showed an average of 0.5 second runtime of that query). So it shouldn't slow down the dag processor manager too much.\r\n\r\n@ashb pg_stat won't get flushed until the DB is restarted so we don't really see the diff in frequency, but that is pretty important in the evaluation here. Even with the provided data, query time of 25 DAG files added would already beat the joined query, not to mention the overhead of starting/stopping the transaction.\r\n\r\nIn general I believe it is better to use the aggregated query, thus leverage the query optimizer, instead of trying to optimize ourselves. And esp. with a large scaled cluster that has huge number of DAG files to parse, it would be a show stopper if we distribute the query to the subprocess.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/528699559/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/528706495","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6018#issuecomment-528706495","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6018","id":528706495,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODcwNjQ5NQ==","user":{"login":"TobKed","id":32594847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTk0ODQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32594847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed","html_url":"https://github.com/TobKed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobKed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T04:46:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T04:46:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"cc @mik-laj @ashb","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/528706495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/comments/528710963","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5908#issuecomment-528710963","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5908","id":528710963,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODcxMDk2Mw==","user":{"login":"seelmann","id":86629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann","html_url":"https://github.com/seelmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-06T05:12:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T05:13:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Just reverting it would reintroduce the zombie detection problem (see Jira and discussion in the inital PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5420).
