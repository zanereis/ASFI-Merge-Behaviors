Maybe I'm oversimplifying things, but my conclusion is that if we want to prevent people from dismissing the Python API completely due to premature assessments we end up in a catch-up game we cant win. Next time it's gonna be missing feature X that's causing it, and after that is fixed that we may end up talking about feature Y or yet again about performance.\n\nMy other major gripe is that there are things that people could work on while we fix the performance. The PlanBinding stuff is completely irrelevant to performance. So is Windows support (which surprisingly enough is not just about paths O.o). I can surely find more things if i wanted to. \nthese things will fall flat when we don't merge it, since creating issues (and resolving them), while the code is not in the main project seems a bit iffy.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63859374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/63872922","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/202#issuecomment-63872922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/202","id":63872922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzODcyOTIy","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-20T20:21:43Z","updated_at":"2014-11-20T20:21:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it would be pretty bad, if we end up having an API that is a lot!

I think it absolutely should work since relative paths are so common. without _some_ change, supporting relative paths is always a clunky affair since you have to check for scheme's yourself before using `getAbsolutePath()`.\n\nRegarding normalization: We could move `uri = new URI(\"file\", null, new File(uri.getPath()).getAbsolutePath(), null);` into the URISyntaxException block. It will only be executed if the current code fails anyway, and as such shouldn't affect working code.\n\nRegarding forgotten slashes:  If you go through the Path class the scheme will be correctly identified no matter how many slashes are behind `file:`, and if there are none it throws an exception in the constructor. The only problematic case i can think of is : `FileSystem.get(new URI(\"file:world.txt\"))`. In this case, getPath would return null. But since the scheme is correctly identified as `file` the code in questions will not be executed, and as such has no bearing on this issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/64092085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/64097626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/173#issuecomment-64097626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/173","id":64097626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDk3NjI2","user":{"login":"fhueske","id":2388347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODgzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske","html_url":"https://github.com/fhueske","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhueske/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-22T22:15:13Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T22:15:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Replaced exception by missing `ExecutionGraph.fail()`\nAdded test case with failing `finalizeOnMaster()` call.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/64097626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/64100176","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/201#issuecomment-64100176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/201","id":64100176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTAwMTc2","user":{"login":"FelixNeutatz","id":5217389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTczODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5217389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz","html_url":"https://github.com/FelixNeutatz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FelixNeutatz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-22T23:52:35Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T23:52:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"So I would need to iterate over the content of DelimitedInputFormat.nextRecord():\n\n``` java\nif (readLine()) {\n    return readRecord(record, this.currBuffer, this.currOffset, this.currLen);\n} else {\n    this.end = true;\n    return null;\n}\n```\n\nThe problem is, in CsvInputFormat I have no access to this.currBuffer, this.currOffset, this.currLen.
