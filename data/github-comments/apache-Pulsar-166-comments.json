However, if we don't delete the files and keep the contents under the main version, there will be many duplicate contents, which will lead to confusion when the contributors contribute. therefore, we delete the contents and only keep one header in order for the sub-version to have a correct index, the contributor only needs to update the contents in the main version.\r\n@candlerb \r\n\r\n`functions-api.md`\r\nmain version (latest version)\r\n```\r\n---\r\nid: functions-api\r\ntitle: The Pulsar Functions API\r\nsidebar_label: API\r\n---\r\n```\r\nSubversion, (old version)\r\n```\r\n---\r\nid: version-2.4.0-functions-api\r\ntitle: The Pulsar Functions API\r\nsidebar_label: API\r\noriginal_id: functions-api\r\n---\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/557754827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/557759393","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/5728#issuecomment-557759393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5728","id":557759393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzc1OTM5Mw==","user":{"login":"huangdx0726","id":29513837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTEzODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29513837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726","html_url":"https://github.com/huangdx0726","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-23T02:57:10Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T02:57:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The right parentheses should be added after the word of 'the right Parentheses should be added after the word of 'web'.

@sky-big @wolfstudy I think what @chrsoo request is an operator for the full lifecycle management for all the resources within a Pulsar instance. This includes both ClusterOperator and ResourceOperator. \r\n\r\nA ClusterOperator is what @sky-big is doing and most of the *operators* are doing. It is used for setting up a cluster and managing the upgrade, downgrade and scaling up-and-down a cluster.\r\n\r\nA ResourceOperator is more about using *CRD* for provisioning *resources* within a Pulsar cluster. A *resource* such as a role (key and tokens), a tenant, a namespace, a topic, a function and etc. \r\n\r\nOnce everything is modeled as CRD, you can use kubernetes to provision both cluster and resources. Thus you can apply a GitOps patten in a CI/CD pipeline to manage everything.\r\n\r\n@chrsoo : this is kind of aligned with what we (StreamNative) are working on. We shall be able to share what we have done soon.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/557860442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/557886245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3198#issuecomment-557886245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3198","id":557886245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzg4NjI0NQ==","user":{"login":"phreed","id":211644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/211644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed","html_url":"https://github.com/phreed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phreed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-24T13:00:44Z","updated_at":"2019-11-24T13:00:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Why

need an approach related to seek position, current approach will close all consumers while seek position happens,  but this PR will remove the non-durable cursor while all consumers of the non-durable subscription are disconnected. So the reconnected consumer will create a new non-durable cursor using last message id, the unit test can't passed.\r\n\r\nIt's better to have an approach to handle the position seek, there are two point we need to careful handling:\r\n1. Consumers acknowledge by `outstanding` message ids\r\n2. Avoid consumer to process the `outstanding` messages\r\n\r\nHere, the outstanding messages means messages already dispatched to consumers but the cursor is reset.\r\n\r\nFor the first point, i think we can use the `read position`, the `read position` always larger than the mark delete position except the cursor reset happens, so if the broker ignore the acknowledge requests which the acknowledge position is larger than `read position`, because there is cursor reset happens.\r\n\r\nFor the second point, if the consumer cache to many outstanding messages, it's waste of resources if process all of these messages, so it's better to send a cursor reseted notify to consumers before dispatch messages after the cursor reset to consumers, consumers can reset their stat, clear the outstanding messages. currently close consumers also can reset consumer state, clear outstanding messages.\r\n\r\nAnd in https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5278, we also have discussed about the reset consumer state when cursor reset happens.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, i think we can don't close the readers first, and then create a new PR to improve cursor reset since it might need to change the wire protocol.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/557966126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/557966291","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5722#issuecomment-557966291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5722","id":557966291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1Nzk2NjI5MQ==","user":{"login":"zymap","id":24502569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTAyNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24502569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap","html_url":"https://github.com/zymap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T02:52:19Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T02:52:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tooptoop4

\r\n\r\n1) first question, how to understand \"storage size\"?\r\n\r\nThe total size = sum(size of each ledger) + currentLedgerSize.\r\n\r\n\"size of each ledger\" is the `size` field of a ledger stat in `ledgers` list. The size of the last ledger (active and not-closed ledger) is shown in `currentLedgerSize`.\r\n\r\nThe size of each ledger is the total of the entry size. Each entry is comprised of size of entry data and extra metadata (a couple of bytes).\r\n\r\nEach entry is a message batch. Each message in a message batch also carries additional metadata (msg metadata plus checksum). \r\n\r\nBecause additional metadata is added to each message and each entry (message batch), the storage size will be larger than (number message * message size).\r\n\r\n2) understand the disk usage under /data.\r\n\r\nthe storage size doesn't simply equal to the disk usage under /data.\r\n\r\nthe disk usage of /data is comprised of two parts, one is journal, the other is ledger. \r\n\r\n1) The journal is reclaimed after the data is persisted to ledger directories, however bookies keep `journalMaxBackups` number of journals for disaster recovery. \r\n\r\n2) The ledger is comprised of entry data and index. The index is stored in rocksdb. So the disk usage is also larger than the storage size you will see in the stats.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHope this gives you a better view about storage size and disk usage. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBack to the question about the unit of `StorageSize`, it is `bytes`. @Jennifer88huang you can proceed the fix #5707. We can have a separate pull request to document what does `storage size` mean.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/558011566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/558045410","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5733#issuecomment-558045410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/5733","id":558045410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODA0NTQxMA==","user":{"login":"wolfstudy","id":20965307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTY1MzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20965307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfstudy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfstudy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-25T08:27:03Z","updated_at":"2019-11-25T08:27:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"run
