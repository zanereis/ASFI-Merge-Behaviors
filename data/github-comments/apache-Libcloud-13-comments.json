Caching/re-using tokens will prevent you from exceeding API limits. So, I'd be concerned that not caching tokens and silently swallowing errors could lead to a very hard to debug situation. See here [https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2]\n\nI haven't tested this, but I suspect you could get the same effect if you chose to use `/dev/null` as your credential file.\n\nI don't think we should go with this approach.  My first suggestion is to dig into why you're seeing IOErrors and fix that issue (NFS mount, bad file permissions, use a different credential file location, etc). If you really want to bypass using a credential file, give the `/dev//null` trick a try.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/63639392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/63650978","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/373#issuecomment-63650978","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/373","id":63650978,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzNjUwOTc4","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-19T14:52:42Z","updated_at":"2014-11-19T14:52:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"LGTM.

I found this issue while trying to use libcloud v0.16.0. I suspected there was an issue in the libcloud code when I was getting errors back from the softlayer API while sending ex_keyname='keyname' into the create_node function. I opened a ticket with them and they sent me back a short code snippet using their python library here: https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python/tree/master/SoftLayer. In it they sent sshKeys as a list of one dictionary in the format of the change I have made. You can see where they handle ssh keys in their python library at line 350 of the _generate_create_dict method: https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-python/blob/master/SoftLayer/managers/vs.py. It is the same code that I have modified the libcloud code to be. Hopefully that was enough info :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/67239732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/67246337","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/416#issuecomment-67246337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/416","id":67246337,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MjQ2MzM3","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-16T22:39:24Z","updated_at":"2014-12-16T22:39:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the clarification.\n\nLooks good, merged into trunk.

Other providers drivers handle it in that matter and it makes more sense as well. Amazon not handling it in that manner is, imo, really just exposing an (unfriendly) implementation detail to the end user. The whole idea behind Libcloud is to try to hide (as much as possible) all the inconsistencies between the providers and expose a consistent standard API.\n\nDeleting all the related records when user really just wants to delete one, breaks the API promise. Sadly in some cases we can't avoid that (in those cases we use ex_ prefixes), but in this one we can.\n\nAnd update_record and all the other methods also work with a single record - that's the whole promise of the standard API.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/70369616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/70369835","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/432#issuecomment-70369835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/432","id":70369835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzY5ODM1","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-17T14:57:06Z","updated_at":"2015-01-17T14:57:06Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> zones.get_records() will return several records for a multivalue record, while dnsdriver.get_record(zone.id,'A:whatever') will return only one multivalued record.\n> \n> IMO this should be unified somehow as to not be presented in different ways.

This is just an implementation detail in Route53 API which we need to handle and expose a consistent API to the end user.\n\nAs far as fixing `get_record` goes - it sounds like we will need to implement a different id scheme for records with multiple values - e.g. hash of type, name, data. This will allows us to expose a consistent API and allow users to retrieve a single record. This is also some what related to delete_record, but we can already implement single record deletion without doing the id change...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/70369835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/70369865","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/432#issuecomment-70369865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/432","id":70369865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzY5ODY1","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-17T14:58:19Z","updated_at":"2015-01-17T14:58:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Also, forgot to say - good catch on get_record as well - that's another edge case we need to handle.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/70369865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/comments/70386140","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/430#issuecomment-70386140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/430","id":70386140,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzg2MTQw","user":{"login":"wirkijowski","id":5868871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4Njg4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5868871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski","html_url":"https://github.com/wirkijowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wirkijowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-17T21:58:56Z","updated_at":"2015-01-17T21:58:56Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In order to comply with standart libcloud API, there could be create_volume() method.
