Does that work or do you want something else?\r\n\r\nI think we should use broker instance id. In containerized envs host:port doesn't have much meaning. (but we can ignore this.. see below)\r\n\r\n@KKcorps : To unblock you and also allow revisiting this in the future, let's return a string requestId (which may simply be `Long.toString(requestId)` for now).\r\n\r\nOnce we change the requestId everywhere, we can change the broker response also accordingly. This is also consistent with the fact that the current requestId is a long and the returned response from Broker should match with whatever ID the broker uses.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1535191689/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1535203408","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/issues/10720#issuecomment-1535203408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10720","id":1535203408,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5bgVhQ","user":{"login":"abhioncbr","id":1076944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1076944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr","html_url":"https://github.com/abhioncbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-04T18:11:21Z","updated_at":"2023-05-04T18:11:21Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I can take a look.

I have made a change for the group id value filling and it now behaves like:\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\nintCol, \r\nargmin(longCol, **doubleCol**),  \r\nargmin(longCol, **longCol**)   \r\nFROM table \r\nGROUP BY intCol\r\n```\r\n\r\nintCol | argmin(longCol, doubleCol) | argmin(longCol, longCol)\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n1 | 2.0 | 2\r\n1 | 3.0 | 2\r\n2 | 4.0 | 1\r\n\r\nSELECT \r\nargmin(intCol, **stringCol**),  \r\nargmin(intCol, **doubleCol**), \r\nsum(doubleCol)  \r\nFROM table\r\n\r\nargmin(intCol, stringCol) | argmin(intCol, doubleCol) | sum(doubleCol)\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n\"a2\" | 2.0 | 9.0\r\n\"a11\"* | 3.0 | 9.0\r\n\r\nwhich is essentially flattened view of \r\n\r\nintCol | argmin(longCol, doubleCol) | argmin(longCol, longCol)\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n1 | [2.0, 3.0] | 2\r\n2 | 4.0 | 1\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nargmin(intCol, stringCol) | argmin(intCol, doubleCol) | sum(doubleCol)\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n[\"a2\", \"a11\"] | [2.0, 3.0] | 9.0\r\n\r\nrespectively\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I have also considered the option array fashion of returning multiple rows of output, there are a few reasons I didn't use it:\r\n\r\n1. It wouldn't work for all MV types as we currently don't have sth like ARRAY[ARRAY[INT]] for returned results\r\n2. It would be easier for the user to parse the result when this is flattened, as the user side will not need to flatten + align them on their own when they are projecting multiple cols.\r\n3. Using the flattened view will keep the output column type the same as the data column type, which I feel is cleaner.\r\n\r\n>IMO we should allow other aggregation functions with argmin and argmax.\r\n\r\n+1 on this, if we have a well-defined output scheme then the user should have the power to run 1 query instead of 2\r\n\r\ncc @siddharthteotia @somandal \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1537644964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/comments/1537660878","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10739#issuecomment-1537660878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pinot/issues/10739","id":1537660878,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATCU_c5bptfO","user":{"login":"abhioncbr","id":1076944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY5NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1076944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr","html_url":"https://github.com/abhioncbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhioncbr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-08T02:46:44Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T00:24:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"~~I am not sure, but `integration test set 2` failures don't seem to be related to this issue.\r\nAlso, failed tests are working fine in my local with the current changes.
