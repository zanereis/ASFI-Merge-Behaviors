don't think we typically run jobs inside of getPartitions - so this changes some semantics of calling that function. For instance a lot of the other RDD constructors immediately access the partitions of their parents when constructed. This would change the lazy evaluation model of Spark.\n\nThe difficulties here are coming from the fact that sliding really _isn't_ a parallelizable problem. In the limit case where the partitions size is small and/or the window size is close to the number of partitions, this effectively requires all-to-all communication.\n\nI wonder if it's better implemented using a shuffle. This is more expensive but it might be the only way.

Michael, I really like the docs and API for this!\n\nI tried this out in spark-shell though and saw a few errors:\n- The built-in SQL seems to be case-sensitive -- it complained about \"select \\* from foo\" but not \"SELECT \\* FROM foo\"\n- When trying to do `[ExecutedQuery].rdd.collect()`, I got `NotSerializableException: SqlContext`\n\nMaybe these are just due to the shell environment, I'm not sure if they'd happen in standalone jobs.\n\nAlso, I have some comments on the API to make it more consistent with our other stuff (more later):\n- Capitalize SQL in SQLContext, to match some of the other names where we capitalize acronyms\n- Instead of making registerAsTable an implicit conversion on RDDs, make it a method of SQLContext, so that the API looks the same in Java and Python. (There may be other places where we can do this.)\n- Do we really want loadFile to infer the file type? It might be better to have loadParquetFile and allow other types in the future\n\nFinally, add ScalaDoc comments to all the public methods on things like SQLContext.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/37751624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/37752740","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/148#issuecomment-37752740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/148","id":37752740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzUyNzQw","user":{"login":"sryza","id":654855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDg1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/654855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza","html_url":"https://github.com/sryza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sryza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-16T09:25:12Z","updated_at":"2014-03-16T09:25:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Currently, Spark doesn't ship a log4j.properties.
