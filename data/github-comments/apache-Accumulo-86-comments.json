The TabletServer has configuration properties to control the amout of memory available to the heap, in-memory maps, and block caches, and the size of the various thread pools that perform these activities. For example:\r\n\r\n    tserver.assignment.concurrent.max\r\n    tserver.bulk.process.threads\r\n    tserver.cache.data.size\r\n    tserver.cache.index.size\r\n    tserver.cache.summary.size\r\n    tserver.compaction.major.concurrent.max\r\n    tserver.compaction.minor.concurrent.max\r\n    tserver.memory.maps.max\r\n    tserver.migrations.concurrent.max\r\n    tserver.recovery.concurrent.max\r\n    tserver.scan.executors.default.threads\r\n    tserver.scan.executors.meta.threads\r\n    tserver.scan.files.open.max\r\n    tserver.server.threads.minimum\r\n    tserver.sort.buffer.size\r\n    tserver.summary.partition.threads\r\n    tserver.summary.remote.threads\r\n    tserver.total.mutation.queue.max\r\n    tserver.workq.threads\r\n\r\nWhen a TabletServer exhausts available memory, for whatever reason, an OutOfMemoryError will be raised and the TabletServer will be terminated. When this happens the clients running scans on that TabletServer are paused while the Tablets are re-hosted and then the scans continue on the new TabletServers once the re-hosting process is complete. If the cause of the TabletServer failure was due to scans on a particular Tablet, then this process will repeat until there are no TabletServers remaining or the pattern is identified by a user/admin and the scan process is terminated.\r\n\r\n## Objective\r\n\r\nProvide Accumulo users with the ability to run scans without terminating the TabletServer.\r\n\r\n## Possible approaches\r\n\r\n  1. Run the scan in a separate process\r\n  2. Restrict memory usage on a per-scan basis\r\n  3. Read directly from files in client side scan code.  This approach does not allow a small number of clients to scale out a large number of expensive queries to tablet and/or scan servers.  It also may lead to an OOM killing a client process that may be executing multiple concurrent scans.  It also does not allow client to leverage cache of data and metadata on a scan server or tablet server.\r\n\r\n## This approach\r\n\r\nCreate a separate server process that is used to run user scans and give the user the option whether or not to use the new server process on a per-scan basis. Provide the user with the ability to control how many scans will be affected if this new process dies and how many of these new processes to use for a single scan.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n\r\n  1. a new server process called the ScanServer.\r\n  2. changes to the Accumulo client\r\n  3. changes to the GarbageCollector\r\n  4. Ancillary changes\r\n\r\n### Scan Server\r\n\r\nThe ScanServer is a TabletHostingServer that hosts SnapshotTablets and implements the TabletScanClientService Thrift API. When the ScanServer receives a request via the scan API, it creates a SnapshotTablet object from the Tablet metadata (which may be cached), and then uses the ThriftScanClientHandler to complete the scan operations. The user scan is run using the same code that the TabletServer uses; the ScanServer is just responsible for ensuring that the Tablet exists for the scan code. The Tablet hosted within the ScanServer may not contain the exact same data as the corresponding Tablet hosted by the TabletServer. The ScanServer does not have any of the Tablet data that may reside within the in-memory maps and the Tablet may reference files that have been compacted as Tablet metadata can be cached within the ScanServer (see Property.SSERV_CACHED_TABLET_METADATA_EXPIRATION). The number of concurrent scans that the ScanServer will run is configurable (Property.SSERV_SCAN_EXECUTORS_DEFAULT_THREADS and Property.SSERV_SCAN_EXECUTORS_PREFIX). The ScanServer has other configuration properties that can be set to allow it to have different settings than the TabletServer (Thrift, block caches, etc). It is also possible that a ScanServer may be hosting multiple versions of a SnapshotTablet in the case where scans are in progress, the TabletMetadata has expires, and a new scan request arrives.\r\n\r\nScan servers implement a busy timeout parameter on their scan RPCs.  The busytimeout allows a client to specify a configurable time during which the scan must either start running or throw a busy thrift exception.  On the client side this busy exception can be detected and a different scan server selected.\r\n\r\n### Client changes\r\n\r\nA new method has been added to the client (ScannerBase.setConsistencyLevel) to configure the client to use IMMEDIATE (default) or EVENTUAL consistency for scans. IMMEDIATE means that the user wants to scan all data related to the Tablet at the time of the scan. To accomplish this the client will send the scan request to the TabletServer that is hosting the Tablet. This is the current behavior and is the default configuration, so no code change is required to have the same behavior. The other possible value, EVENTUAL, means that the user is willing to relax the data freshness guarantee that the TabletServer provides and instead potentially improve the chances of their scan completing when their scan is known to take a long time or require a lot of memory. When the consistency level is set to EVENTUAL the client uses a ScanServerDispatcher class to determine which ScanServers to use. The user can supply their own ScanServerDispatcher implementation (ClientProperty.SCAN_SERVER_DISPATCHER) if they don't want to use the DefaultScanServerDispatcher (see class javadoc for a description of the behavior). Scans will be sent to the TabletServer in the event that EVENTUAL consistency is selected for the client and no ScanServers are running.\r\n\r\n#### Default scan server dispatcher\r\n\r\nThe default scan server dispatcher that executes on the client side has the following strategy for selecting a scan server.\r\n\r\n * It hashes a tablets tableId, end row, and prev endrow.  This hash is used to consitently map the tablet to one of three random scan servers.  So for a given tablet the same three random scan servers are used by different tablets.\r\n * The client sends a request to one of the three scan servers with a small busytimeout.\r\n * If a busytimeout exception happens, then the default scan server dispatcher will notice this and it will choose from a larger set of scan servers.\r\n * The default scan server dispatcher will expand rapidly to randomly selecting from all scan servers after which point it will start exponentially increasing the busy timeout.\r\n\r\nFor example if there are 1000 scan servers and a lot of them are busy, the default scan dispatcher might do something like the following.  This example shows how it will rapidly increase the set of servers chosen from and then start rapidly increasing the busy timeout.  The reason to start increasing the busy timeout after observing a lot busy exceptions is that those provide evidence that the entire cluster of scan servers may be busy. So eventually its better to just go to a scan server and queue up rather look for a non-busy scan server.\r\n\r\n 1. Choose scan server S1 from 3 random scan servers with a busy timeout of 33ms.\r\n 2. If a busy exceptions happens. Choose scan server S2 from 21 random scan servers with a busy timeout of 33ms.\r\n 3. If a busy exceptions happens. Choose scan server S3 from 147 random scan servers with a busy timeout of 33ms.\r\n 4. If a busy exceptions happens. Choose scan server S4 from 1000 random scan servers with a busy timeout of 33ms.\r\n 5. If a busy exceptions happens. Choose scan server S5 from 1000 random scan servers with a busy timeout of 66ms.\r\n 6. If a busy exceptions happens. Choose scan server S6 from 1000 random scan servers with a busy timeout of 132ms.\r\n\r\nThis default behavior makes tablets sticky to scan servers which is good for cache utilization and reusing cached tablet metadata. In the case where those few scan servers are busy the client starts searching for other places to run.\r\n\r\n### Garbage Collector changes\r\n\r\nThe ScanServer inserts entries into a new section (~sserv) of the metadata table to place a reservation on the file so that the GarbageCollector process does not remove the files that are being used for the scan. Accordingly GCEnv.getReferences has been modified to include these file reservations in the list of active file references. The ScanServer has a background thread that removes the file reservations from the metadata table after some period of time after the file is no longer used (see Property.SSERVER_SCAN_REFERENCE_EXPIRATION_TIME). The Manager has a new background thread that calls the ScanServerMetadataEntries.clean method on a periodic basis. Users can use the ScanServerMetadataEntries utility to remove file reservations that exist in the metadata table with no corresponding running ScanServer.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid race conditions with the Accumulo GC, Scan servers use the following algorithm when first reading a tablets metadata.\r\n\r\n 1. Read metadata for tablet\r\n 2. Write an ~sserv entries for the tablets files to the metadata table to prevent GC\r\n 3. Read the meadata again and see if it changed.  If it did changes delete the entries from step 2 and go back to step 1.\r\n\r\nThe above algorithm may be a bit expensive the first time a tablet is scanned on scan server.  However subsequent scans of the same tablet will use cached tablet metadata for a configurable time and not repeate the above steps.  In the future we may want to look into faster ways of preventing GC of files used by scan servers.\r\n\r\n### Ancillary changes\r\n\r\n  1. Modifications to scripts (accumulo-cluster, accumulo-service and accumulo-env.sh) have been made to start/stop one or more ScanServers per host. \r\n  2. The shell commands `grep` and `scan` have been modified to accept a consistency level (`cl`) argument\r\n  3. The shell command `listscans` has been modified to include scans running on ScanServers\r\n  4. ZooZap has been modified to remove ScanServer entries in ZooKeeper\r\n  5. MiniAccumuloCluster has been modified to include the ability to start/stop ScanServers (used by the ITs)\r\n  6. A new utility (ScanServerMetadataEntries) has been created to cleanup any dangling scan server file references in the metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Shell Example\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of how this works using the `scan` command in the shell.\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@test> createtable test (1)\r\nroot@test test> insert a b c d (2)\r\nroot@test test> scan (3)\r\na b:c []\td\r\nroot@test test> scan -cl immediate (4)\r\na b:c []\td\r\nroot@test test> scan -cl eventual (5)\r\nroot@test test> flush (6)\r\n2022-01-28T18:58:10,693 [shell.Shell] INFO : Flush of table test  initiated...\r\nroot@test test> scan (7)\r\na b:c []\td\r\nroot@test test> scan -cl eventual (8)\r\na b:c []\td\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, I create a table (1) and insert some data (2). When I run a scan (3,4) with the immediate consistency level, which happens to be the default, the client uses the normal code path and issues the scan command against the Tablet Server. Data is returned because the Tablet Server code path also returns data that is in the in-memory map.

I would veto that.\r\n\r\n1. Minified code does not meet the OSI definition of open source, nor the FSF definition of free software, so we'd have to be careful to only include the minified version in the convenience binary. It should never be used in the source repository or source release artifact. I don't think it's worth even bothering for the binary distribution.\r\n2. Minified code is primarily done for obfuscation and bandwidth savings. Even without browser caching, it's unlikely to have any meaningful effect on bandwidth for our tiny inconsequential javascript files. And, as an open source project, we should explicitly avoid obfuscation.\r\n\r\nWe previously used to redistribute the minimized version of jQuery. We explicitly [stopped doing that](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-4741). We definitely shouldn't be doing it for our own files.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would strongly prefer not to depend on anything in NPM/Node. We are not a Javascript project, and we should not depend and that development stack of tools. If it's installed as part of a CI check for code quality, I don't mind. But, I don't want to put that much of a burden on our developers to learn a whole new developer toolset for what is primarily a Java project. Any JS tooling should be quite minimal and extremely convenient to edit.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1117943665/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1118005717","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2677#issuecomment-1118005717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2677","id":1118005717,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5Co2nV","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-04T22:52:33Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T22:52:33Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"All the modified tools need to be checked to ensure they didn't break, but they shouldn't have.

Where there are many REST calls being made (e.g. the front \"Accumulo Overview\" page), the console can get quite long. Is this the intention?\r\n\r\nI read that in some browsers, console.info, console.debug, and console.log are all treated identically, but in other browsers, these may be organized. From what I've read, in recent versions of Google Chrome, console.debug messages are only shown if you have the \"Verbose\" option selected, which is not the default. So, if you use console.debug for the messages that represent the background work, the console is less noisy by default, but it'd be easy to show everything if you wanted. I would recommend using console.info for less noisy foreground tasks and console.debug for more noisy background tasks. But, this is a just a rough guideline. It may not be obvious which are which, though I'd suspect most AJAX requests are background.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1119044882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1119046438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2286#issuecomment-1119046438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2286","id":1119046438,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5Cs0sm","user":{"login":"DomGarguilo","id":47725857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzI1ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47725857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo","html_url":"https://github.com/DomGarguilo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DomGarguilo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-05T21:07:02Z","updated_at":"2022-05-05T21:07:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It seems like most table's data are consistently left aligned with a few tables having hardcoded right alignment for certain columns.

Every table is unique, after all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1120095542/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/comments/1121481942","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2506#issuecomment-1121481942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo/issues/2506","id":1121481942,"node_id":"IC_kwDOACaFSM5C2HTW","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-09T19:19:49Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T19:19:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've definitely seen this before.
