It's obvious that the clients don't need to send requests to all backend servers but should improve concurrency to reduce `false empty response`. In the future, the proxy could long-polling from all the backend machines to reduce client pressure.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1166963439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1166965871","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4483#issuecomment-1166965871","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4483","id":1166965871,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85Fjnxv","user":{"login":"zhouxinyu","id":3961183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjExODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3961183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouxinyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-27T07:09:25Z","updated_at":"2022-06-27T07:09:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"BTW, do you use the POP technology in your production environment?

on the content of the document: https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/blob/e05b098327d0781362121c65e1c9445c0cb0684b/docs/cn/Configuration_TLS.md\r\nI have some questions as below:\r\n\r\n\r\na. For rocketmq 4.9.2 and later versions, must TLS set up in mutual authentication? Can it be set in only server-side authentication?\r\n\r\n\r\nb. As the step 3.2 in above document:\r\n\r\n>> Edit runbroker SH, in Java_ The following contents are added to opt:\r\n>> JAVA_ OPT=\"${JAVA_OPT} -Dorg.apache.rocketmq.remoting.ssl.mode=enforcing -Dtls.config.file=/opt/rocketmq-4.9.3/conf/tls.properties -Dtls.enable=true\"\r\n\r\nI didn't find the corresponding content of the source code for the paramemter \"org.apache.rocketmq.remoting.ssl.mode\". Is it wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\nc. It seems the value of parameter \"tls.server.need.client.auth\" controls whether client authentication (mutual authentication) is enabled, is it right? \r\nbut what are the parameter \"tls.server.authClient\" and \"tls.client.authServer\" used for?\r\n\r\n\r\nd. It seems to be some contradiction In the above document: the parameter \"tls.client.authServer\" is set to false (in tls.properties file) on borker and namesrv, but set to true (in java_opt environment variable) on producer and consumer. Why?\r\n\r\n\r\ne. When we finish all steps in the above document. Will the interaction between the broker and the namesrv also be subject to client authentication?\r\nFor example, the broker reports its own status to namesrv (heartbeat), which is also a TLS encrypted communication?\r\nThe mean When a broker reports to a namesrv, the broker as a client, also needs to be verified by the namesrv (client authentication), it is Right?\r\n\r\n\r\nf. If we enable TLS according to the steps in the document, does it affect the rocketmq-dashboard connection to rocketmq cluster (namesrv) ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1169108366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1169254271","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1272#issuecomment-1169254271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1272","id":1169254271,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85FsWd_","user":{"login":"wl1092212424","id":48676586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njc2NTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48676586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424","html_url":"https://github.com/wl1092212424","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wl1092212424/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-28T21:20:23Z","updated_at":"2022-06-28T21:20:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The

在 RocketMQ 的使用过程中，有以下服务器参与交互：Producer，Consumer，Broker，Namesrv，Dashboard；\r\n    Producer，Consumer，Dashboard 只能作为 Client，即连接的发起方\r\n    Namesrv 只能作为 Server，即连接的接收方\r\n    Broker 同时作为 Server 和 Client，broker作为client主动连接Namesrv，borker也作为server被 Producer 和 Consumer 连接\r\n\r\n2. Configuration_TLS.md 文档中描述的是一个 Client - Server 双向验证的 TLS 配置过程，因此 Server上配置 server证书、server私钥、根证书，同时 Client 上也许需要配置 client证书、client私钥、根证书。并且所有 Client ( Producer, Consumer, Dashboard，Broker 都需要配置 tls.enable=true，来确保发起 TLS 连接。\r\n\r\n3. 其实 RocketMQ 是支持单向认证的，并且可同时支持 TLS 连接和非 TLS 连接， 所以我们一般都只需要配置 Server 端认证的 TLS 就可以了，相对于双向认证，Server 端认证可以避免未来因证书过期导致的大批量更换 Client 证书的工作；同时支持 TLS 和非 TLS 连接，可以让同一套 RocketMQ 同时对内提供服务（非TLS连接，比如Dashboard管理RocketMQ集群）和 对外提供服务（公网或者跨站点访问RocketMQ的生产者，消费者连接），减少我们的管理成本。\r\n\r\n实现 Server 端单向认证，并且同时支持TLS连接和非TLS连接，需要我们完成一下工作：\r\n\r\n1). 在所有的Server上部署server证书和server私钥，Server包括：Namesrv，Broker\r\n2). 在需要TLS的Client上部署根证书，Client包括：Producer，Consumer，Dashboard，Broker\r\n3). 在所有的Server端，使用 tls.server.mode = permissive 来确保可以同时接收 TLS 和 非 TLS 连接\r\n4). 在需要TLS的Client上使用 tls.enable = true 来确保发起 TLS 连接\r\n5). 在不需要TLS的Client上使用tls.enable = false 来确保发起非 TLS 连接\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n假设场景：\r\n\r\nNamesrv 和 Broker 之间通信不使用TLS\r\nDashboard 和 Namesrv 之间同时不使用TLS\r\nProducerA，ConsumerA 使用TLS连接Namesrv和Broker，并且使用Server端单向认证\r\nProducerB，ConsumerB 使用非TLS连接Namesrv和Broker\r\n\r\n所以如果我们使用自签名证书来实现以上场景时的步骤为：\r\n\r\nstep1 签署CA根证书\r\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca_rsa_private.pem -x509 -days 365 -out ca.pem\r\n\r\n\r\nstep2 准备server端认证所需的私钥和证书\r\n\r\nstep2.1 生成server私钥并签发server证书\r\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server_rsa.key  -out server.csr\r\nopenssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca_rsa_private.pem -CAcreateserial -out server.pem\r\n\r\nstep2.2 打包并加密server私钥\r\nopenssl pkcs8 -topk8 -v1 PBE-SHA1-RC4-128 -in  server_rsa.key -out server.key\r\n\r\n注：在后面配置过程中，需要使用以下3个文件\r\na. 打包并加密的server私钥 server.key，用于部署在Server端（Namesrv，Broker）\r\nb. server证书 server.pem，用于部署在Server端（Namesrv，Broker）\r\nc.

review意见:\r\n\r\n1. 以SyncStateSet不以IP作为依据，而是以brokerId（Controller给broker的唯一编号）作为依据，HA部分同步要改。\r\n2. 整理InSyncReplicas、minInSyncReplicas在Controller模式下含义，当SyncStateSet个数小于minInSyncReplicas时，副本写入将不再成功，返回PutMessageStatus.IN_SYNC_REPLICAS_NOT_ENOUGH\r\n3. 不再复用NameServer的心跳，都使用Controller独立的心跳、去掉controllerDeployedStandAlone参数，心跳包新增maxOffset、confirmOffset、last epoch等字段。这些会作为选举的依据\r\n4. 选举后SyncStateSet应该继承下来而不是直接变为新Master，一个场景是新被选出的主，该主马上又挂了，此时就没有master可以被选举（不过从当前实现来看，若改为继承，slave若没有马上连到master，会增加故障恢复的时间，并且master会马上更新新的SyncStateSet，而slave连上master首先需要获取haMasterAddress从namesrv注册结果中返回，需要一段时间（考虑在controller中维护haMasterAddress）），同时这种情况下注意confirmOffset回退问题（先进行分析）\r\n5. Controller 的格式带上rocketmq message header，以便于后面扩展\r\n6. 对于磁盘坏、心跳好的情况，需要再细分PutMessageStatus（能显示磁盘坏），如果磁盘坏了，同样需要选举切换。","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1170928177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/1171052962","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4534#issuecomment-1171052962","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4534","id":1171052962,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl85FzNmi","user":{"login":"Justinwins","id":20087352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDg3MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20087352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins","html_url":"https://github.com/Justinwins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Justinwins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-30T10:35:15Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T10:35:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@zhouxinyu
