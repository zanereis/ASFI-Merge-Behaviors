environment.\r\n\r\n1. Basically Zeppelin's python\r\npython: 2.71\r\ninstalled library: (none)\r\n\r\nuse to zeppelin\r\n```\r\n%python\r\nimport sys\r\nprint(sys.version)\r\nprint(sys.path)\r\n```\r\nresult\r\n```\r\npython version 2.7.1\r\n%ZEPPELIN_HOME%/interpreter/python/lib:%PYTHON_HOME\r\n```\r\n```\r\n%python\r\nimport myModule\r\n```\r\nresult\r\n```\r\nno module myModule\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. install conda and new python \r\n```\r\n%python.conda create --name python3 python=3.4\r\n```\r\n```\r\n%python.conda activate python3\r\n```\r\n```\r\n%python\r\nimport sys\r\nprint(sys.version)\r\nprint(sys.path)\r\n```\r\nresult\r\n```\r\npython version 3.4\r\n%ZEPPELIN_HOME%/interpreter/python/lib:%PYTHON_HOME:%CONDA_ENV%/python3/lib\r\n```\r\n```\r\n%python\r\nimport myModule\r\n```\r\nresult\r\n```\r\nno module myModule\r\n```\r\ntry again\r\n```\r\n%python.conda install myModule\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport myModule\r\n```\r\nresult\r\n```\r\nimported.\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. restore python environment\r\n```\r\n%python.conda deactivate\r\n```\r\ncheck for recovered to the original Zeppelin environment.\r\n```\r\n%python\r\nimport sys\r\nprint(sys.version)\r\nprint(sys.path)\r\n```\r\nresult\r\n```\r\npython version 2.7.1\r\n%ZEPPELIN_HOME%/interpreter/python/lib:%PYTHON_HOME\r\n```\r\n```\r\nimport myModule\r\n```\r\nresult\r\n```\r\nno module myModule\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll three must be supported by conda.\r\n1. Support to installing and using the python library\r\n2. Support to change the python version\r\n3. Support to configuring non-python environments\r\n\r\nold zeppelin does works for this part(0.71).\r\nbut, the Python Interpreter has changed significantly since 0.71.\r\nI guess missing the environment part for this.\r\nI modified it.\r\n\r\n\r\npython env set
