Maintain the status quo\r\n\r\n2. Agreed minimum compatible resolution value\r\n\r\n3. Responsive layout, that is, more buttons mentioned above. When the mouse moves to more, the hidden navigation menu will be displayed, but it needs to be discussed clearly how to display the above navigation bar when jumping to the corresponding interface of the hidden navigation. If it is still hidden, the page will look disconnected from the navigation.

All you need is link the issue to this pr. eg: describe ```this pr will close #9338``` in this pr. To target specific issue from PR, we recommend use keyword ```fix: #issue_id``` or ```close: #issue_id``` or ```closes: #issue_id``` in your PR describe(not title, jus desc). It would not only connect issue to PR but also close issue automatically when PR is be closed. Feel free to reopen this pr.\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\nAs your're the first time contributor, your CI could run until committer allow it.
