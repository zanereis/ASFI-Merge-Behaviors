sure.\r\nWhen collecting metrics from Parquet footer, Iceberg

field id it mapping, and then uses the obtained field name to get its corresponding metric mode. \r\n\r\nHowever Iceberg will escape special characters in field names when converting an Iceberg Schema to an Parquet MessageType, and those escaped names cannot be restored when converting an Parquet MessageType back to an Iceberg Schema, that is to say, we are now using those escaped column names to get their corresponding metric modes, which may resulted in incorrect results since those escaped names cannot be recognized by MetricsConfig. \r\n\r\nThe ORC path does not have this problem because special characters are not escaped when converting to ORC schema and ORC [itself](https://lists.apache.org/thread/93xbnbs0mr0zxx4fzvrz10m5mmd4qb5w) can handle any UTF-8 characters in the column
