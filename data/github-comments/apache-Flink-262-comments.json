I am not sure how to express the `unit` parameter when using `-` arithmetic. \r\nHow about `('2018-07-31'.toDate - '2018-05-30'.toDate) .diffUnit(TimeIntervalUnit.MONTH)`...\r\n\r\nusing like `diffUnit` etc to express the unit.. what do you think,

Actually I was using `TableEnvironment.connect()` but got used to `writeToSink` style of defining sinks. I think as long as the `writeToSink` remains there, it is hard to prevent legacy code from using it, which would lead to confusion. \r\n\r\nI assumed that `KafkaTableSink` is internal class and change the API semantics causes no confusion (no one would actually invoke KafkaTableSink.configure() apart from internal classes). It is a quick way of resolving the issue and adding a query/sink filedTypes check as well. Please let me know if anything I was missing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/410655698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/410671659","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6118#issuecomment-410671659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6118","id":410671659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDY3MTY1OQ==","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-06T11:02:07Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T11:02:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing this PR as we first have to determine whether this is an issue with Flink or not, which should be done in the JIRA.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/410671659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/comments/410673911","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/6443#issuecomment-410673911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/6443","id":410673911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMDY3MzkxMQ==","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-06T11:12:11Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T11:12:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This increased the minimum maven version from Maven 3.0 to Maven 3.1.\r\n\r\nDo we want that?
