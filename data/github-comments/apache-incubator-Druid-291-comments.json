When `assumeGrouped` is false, there is an earlier stage the data to group rows (`DeterminePartitionsGroupByMapper`/`DeterminePartitionsGroupByReducer`).\r\n\r\nFor native batch ingestion range partitioning, instead of having an earlier stage to group rows, the grouping occurs in the same stage that determines the partitions (i.e., both grouping and partitioning are done with a single pass over the data instead of the two used for hadoop ingestion). Having `assumeGrouped` as `true` still benefits native batch ingestion range partitioning since it avoids the time/space overhead of using a bloom filter to group the rows.\r\n\r\nIn short, the behavior of `assumeGrouped` is not identical between range partitioning for hadoop and native batch ingestion, but it does have a similar effect in improving ingestion performance when set to `true`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/576457905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/576553109","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8879#issuecomment-576553109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/8879","id":576553109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjU1MzEwOQ==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-21T07:28:05Z","updated_at":"2020-01-21T07:28:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This

The unit tests cover serde of the dynamic config. So we should catch any regression issues with the actual configuration via testing in the future. The use of the config item is super elementary. If the boolean is set, it is set, and the conditional will not return true, thus the helpers will be skipped. And whether or not the boolean is set in the config object should be covered by the config unit tests, should it not. So maybe there is not a test to be written. \r\n\r\nUnless we wanted to write an integration test that confirms that if you run an indexing job while coordinator is paused, even though the job completes, you can poll and see the segment doesn't load for x time. and then enable coordinator and confirm segment loads.

thank you very much for taking time to review this PR.\r\n\r\n> I'm wondering you're planning to rename \"used/unused segments\" to \"published/unpublished segments\" in the near future. If not, I think this PR should change those names properly at least for the UI. If you do, I promise to review your follow-up PR as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI don't plan to make a follow-up rename. I don't want to make partial rename in the UI because it will create an inconsistency between UI and official documentation. Then, if docs are changed, there is an inconsistency between docs and code. And so on.\r\n\r\nSo I think there should be a one-time rename. In the part of my comment which you cited, I explained why I think that this PR in its current state is at least not a move in the wrong direction, in terms of rename, because it will greatly simplify the future rename, whoever decided to do it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/577210731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/comments/577232205","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/9066#issuecomment-577232205","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/9066","id":577232205,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NzIzMjIwNQ==","user":{"login":"jchesko","id":1009897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDk4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko","html_url":"https://github.com/jchesko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchesko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-22T15:11:42Z","updated_at":"2020-01-22T15:11:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Very exciting!
