The excerpt is provided below.\r\n\r\n[H2 database]\r\n\r\n20190426 row level security\r\ngroups.google.com/forum/#!msg/h2-database/kn5E7B_70rQ/GkZ_dnACDAAJ\r\n\r\n[HSQLDB]\r\n\r\n20190704 SQL corruption, Filter clause\r\n[user guide] HSQLDB 2.5.0, page 101, \r\nrow level security (RLS), using the Filter clause.\r\nwww.sf.net/p/hsqldb/discussion/73674/thread/fe3b588587\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nRay\r\n\r\n[design draft]\r\n\r\nHSQLDB 2.5.0, user guide, page 101,\r\nfine grained access control,\r\nFilter Where clause for RLS.\r\n\r\nWould H2 become capable of RLS by adding (Where clause) to the Grant statement?\r\n\r\nin syntax\r\n\r\nGrant ... on Table client_po to role_merchant\r\nWhere ( client, USER() ) in (Select client, merchant from permission_table);\r\n\r\nin semantics\r\n\r\nGrant ... on Table client_po to role_merchant\r\nWhere ( client, USER() ) in permission_table( client, merchant );\r\n\r\nThe reasoning is provided below.\r\n\r\n[business case]\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a terse solution to access control, with a differentiation metric based on the (assignment / association).\r\n\r\nEach client, or (client, division), is assigned to a group of merchants. The organization table (client, merchant) ensues. Company adjusts the groups (reallocating merchants) upon business change. In database each client should be served / handled only by assigned / authorized merchants at the given time.\r\n\r\nTwo types of Grant syntax exist for access control.\r\n\r\n1. table based\r\n   Grant ... on Table client_po to role_merchant;\r\n\r\nIn table based approach, all merchants are allowed access to all client POs in the entire table. No differentiation among merchants. This is not enough.\r\n\r\n2. row based\r\n   Grant ... on Table client_po to role_merchant\r\n   Where ( client, USER() ) in permission_table( client, merchant );\r\n\r\nIn row based approach, when the (Where ... in ...) predicate is supported in the Grant statement, the permission_table( client, merchant ) would control, ROW BY ROW, the access to the table of trading data. This RLS, based on differentiation metric of (client-merchant association), is what we need. This scenario of (client-merchant association) may be extended to financial industry, health care systems, insurance claims, etc., where agents are assigned / authorized to serve the designated institutional clients.\r\n\r\nAlternative designs could achieve similar security results. But the Where clause in HSQLDB 2.5.0 appears to be a clever winner hands down. It is terse, versatile, easy on code maintenance, and very importantly, easy on association management (personnel reallocation) in database.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/518068692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/518086834","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7984#issuecomment-518086834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7984","id":518086834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODA4NjgzNA==","user":{"login":"issue-label-bot[bot]","id":48611044,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDg2MTEwNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/27079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/issue-label-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/issue-label-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-05T05:02:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T05:02:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue-Label Bot is automatically applying the label `#bug` to this issue, with a confidence of 0.64.

When I try running docker-compose up I get errors from superset saying the port is in use. \r\n\r\nI tried running @raman325 's steps, but still seem to have an issue. To confirm that I'm running the steps correctly: \r\n1) In the locally installed postgresql.conf I should uncomment and edit the port parameter to be 5344 ( or any number really). \r\n\r\n2) In the docker-compose.yml, I should edit the port parameter so the local port matches the number choice in (1). If I picked 5344 above, I use that as the first number here. The internal mapping number for docker (the second number should be 5342). \r\n\r\n3) If I had edited the second number to be something other than 5342, I should make sure the POSTGRES PORT parameter in the superset block is the same as the second number I've chosen. \r\n\r\n4) If I've done the above correctly, I should be able to have my local postgres running, as well as superset and connect the two, right? \r\n\r\nWhat I'm seeing now is new errors from docker saying that it can't connect at the docker IP address for the new port. Is that something else that needs to be configured?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/518352395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/518369882","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7984#issuecomment-518369882","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7984","id":518369882,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODM2OTg4Mg==","user":{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-05T19:36:42Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T19:36:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Sounds like this shouldn't affect the query plan's or perf in any important way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/518369882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/comments/518398748","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7969#issuecomment-518398748","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/7969","id":518398748,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxODM5ODc0OA==","user":{"login":"bhuvanbhatia0807","id":22019996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDE5OTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22019996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807","html_url":"https://github.com/bhuvanbhatia0807","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhuvanbhatia0807/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-05T21:02:06Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T21:02:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @villebro .
