yes. there is already a `getCurrentRecord`. However the Record interface doesn't catch up the Message interface, hence there are a few fields are not added. e.g. publish time, schema version and redelivery count. As I mentioned in the discussion in #4093 , the problem of having two interfaces is that it is really hard to make them consistent with each other. \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of options here:\r\n\r\n1) we catch up the interface in Record api. but the problem still exists since anytime people make changes to Message api. The metadata will be first lost at Record api until someone add it.\r\n\r\n2) we add `getCurrentMessage` to return the current message.\r\n\r\n3) the proposal here.\r\n\r\nI don't have any strong opinion with any approach here.
