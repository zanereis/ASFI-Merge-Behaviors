specified.\nSo this seems to logically break down to \n- If `sling.deploy.method` is specified use that as specified (error out if invalid)\n- if `sling.deploy.method` is not specified, check for `usePut` (backwards compatibility).\n  - `usePut` is true -> use WebDAV\n  - `usePut` is false -> use Felix Webconsole.\n\nOr am I missing something
