from my understanding watermark is when the data is actually processed in the pipeline, compare to the timestamp which is when the data has been actually created. It allows us to deal with the skew (the gap between data creation time and data processing time). Correct ? So, in the JMS case, the timestamp is basically the message timestamp and the watermark is when the message is consumed from the broker.\n\nWatermark is a (heuristic) lower bound on all future timestamps (in event time). You are using the message time as the event time, and using the time of the most recent message as the watermark.\n\nIf I recall our whiteboard discussion correctly, JMS will deliver messages in timestamp order and in a consistent order even during failures -- so this makes perfect sense: timestamps will only grow, and the last message time is a good watermark.\n\nThis is not, however, the processing time. If the pipeline falls behind, JMS timestamps will be well before the processing time. So it is good that you are not using processing time as the watermark!\n\n> the checkpoint is an object holding the last data consumed. It's a kind of unique identifier for the message. In the case of JMS, I'm using the Message ID which is unique and generated by the broker. Correct ?\n\nAgain, per our discussion this seems exactly right!\n\n> I implemented the initial split reader using the executor recommendation.\n\nLooks great!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/228587035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/228588784","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/534#issuecomment-228588784","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/534","id":228588784,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODU4ODc4NA==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-26T07:40:16Z","updated_at":"2016-06-26T07:40:16Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Updates:\n-

Once Encoder API is released (2.1 ?) it'll probably be better to implement Encoders for common Beam Objects such as `WindowedValue` and `KV`.\n- Migrated from SparkContext to SparkSession (2.0)\n- `Accumulators` (`Aggergator` implementation in Spark) are currently backward-compatible - it'd be nice to upgrade to `AccumulatorV2`.\n- Translations for batch transformations to the Dataset API are complete, excluding IOs - this is a WIP, but I'd like to share my thoughts here, I think that implementing `Read.from` as intended in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-17 is possible only with the RDD API, and that's OK (RDD-Dataset are interoperable) and higher-level transformations such as `TextIO` will be implemented as direct translation to `DataFrameReader.text` which provide further optimizations by the Spark engine.\n  ~~**_Note: all failing tests are because of the lack of IO transformations support._**~~  \n- Concerning `GroupByKey` transformation, since it expects an `Iterable` output value, this implementation materializes the data which might be risky (OOM) but that's the current Beam model as well (which might be better of using `Iterator` instead). All `Combine` implementations (except for `globally`) will use the `combinePerKey` implementation so this will be a problem only if the user insists on grouping by key and applying a transformation to the grouped elements. Maybe this could be optimized as well by holding on to the `KeyValueGroupedDataset` in the context..\n\nFinally, this is a WIP and I plan to work towards resolving IOs first, starting from `Read.from` and moving to higher level IOs. Once the runner supports batch in full, I think we could consider merging with master.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/228749340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/228749960","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/495#issuecomment-228749960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/495","id":228749960,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODc0OTk2MA==","user":{"login":"amitsela","id":4245753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDU3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4245753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela","html_url":"https://github.com/amitsela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amitsela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-27T13:46:39Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T13:50:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jbonofre @tomwhite @kennknowles @dhalperi please review, I'd be happy to hear your thoughts on my notes to this branch as well.\nThanks!\n\nBTW, we should consider adding [WIP] tag to PRs so that Jenkins/Travis won't try to build WIP PRs.

Sergio! Any help on doing Maven stuff is more than welcome. We need to keep the tests passing though:\n1) setup.py contains a reference to apache_beam.get_version() this will not work since the file itself is responsible to install the apache_beam package. This is the reason the code in there is loading manually the version.py file and executing it. You will need to do something similar.\n2) Most tests should start with doing a 'pip install apache_beam...' or more likely 'python setup.py test' on the source code. So we should clarify that in the Maven install section. This is probably what you meant by leaving out the install.\n3) keeping the version of a Python package in pom.xml files seems very non-Pythonic to me. If there is precedence for it then so be it but otherwise I would prefer to have it in the version.py file  and perhaps reference it (if possible) in the pom.xml. Or keep it in two places (not-ideal but may fly for a while).\n4) Also need to decide on a versioning naming/numbering scheme.\n5) setup.py will have to contain the pom.xml as a package data (and get it installed) because the get_version() function is called at runtime.\n\nI suggest as a way to make progress to evolve this CL into  setting up the Maven infrastructure w/o doing changes to the version.py machinery: add the pom.xml file, add setup.py code to install it with the package so get_version() works at runtime, corrections on names.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/228808739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/228810612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/529#issuecomment-228810612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/529","id":228810612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODgxMDYxMg==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-27T17:12:39Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T17:12:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM,

Because python is already installed in every Travis worker image already (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Runtimes) And we also run an apt-get install to install 2.7 version

to @dhalperi I now have a better understanding of the requirements:\n1. I should not use the AUTO_ACK mode on the JMS Session. Instead, I should use CLIENT_ACK and use the checkpoint mark to store the \"pending\" messages. Then, in the checkpoint finalize method, I will explicitly send the ACK to the JMS broker.\n2. The watermark depends of the use cases and user needs. So, a good improvement would be to use a JMS property where the user can store his actually useful watermark. If this property is not defined in the JMS message, then we can fallback to the JMS timestamp (containing the timestamp when the message has been produced on the JMS broker).\n3. Right now, the ConnectionFactory is an attribute of the PTransform (Read). As PTransform can be distributed on the executors, the ConnectionFactory has to be serializable. As the ConnectionFactory is an interface, it's hard to guarantee that any implementation will provide a serializable ConnectionFactory. A potential enhancement would be to use a kind of factory of connection factory, the factory itself would be serializable.\n\nHuge thanks to @dhalperi for his help !\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/229173294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/comments/229175122","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/549#issuecomment-229175122","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/549","id":229175122,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTE3NTEyMg==","user":{"login":"dhalperi","id":526415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjQxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi","html_url":"https://github.com/dhalperi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhalperi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-28T20:36:50Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T20:36:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"LGTM.
