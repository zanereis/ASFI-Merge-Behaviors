I found that the main problems appeared in the following three places:\r\n\r\n1. ProcessDao # submitTaskInstanceToMysql,  saveTaskInstance The method returned true or false to indicate whether the insert was successful, but it is directly ignored here, this may lead to inserting a task to zk that does not exist in db,\r\n\r\n2. ProcessDao # submitTask, submitTaskToQueue also returned true or false to indicate whether the insert was successful, also be ignored here, it's the same question,\r\n\r\n3. and, in the taskQueue.add() method,  the exception was discarded directly, just printed an error log,  but submitTaskToQueue() is to determine whether the addition is successful by catching the exception,  This will cause the method to always return to add successfully even if the task fails to add, \r\n\r\nThis is all the problems I found, maybe you can check again if there are other problems, if not, can you allow me to fix thees bug? I am very willing to do this job, and maybe you can review it after I finish, I just need a little time to fix it, thanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/565502744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/565503507","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1477#issuecomment-565503507","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1477","id":565503507,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTUwMzUwNw==","user":{"login":"clay4megtr","id":17047853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDQ3ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17047853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr","html_url":"https://github.com/clay4megtr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clay4megtr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T16:16:57Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T16:16:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Code format display is always problematic, so I put the code snippet here\r\n\r\n`public TaskInstance submitTaskInstanceToMysql(TaskInstance taskInstance, ProcessInstance processInstance){\r\n    ....\r\n    saveTaskInstance(taskInstance);\r\n    return taskInstance;\r\n}`\r\n\r\n`public TaskInstance submitTask(TaskInstance taskInstance, ProcessInstance processInstance){\r\n      ....... \r\n       submitTaskToQueue(task); // >>>> 提交到zk队列\r\n    return task; \r\n}`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/565503507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/565687229","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1473#issuecomment-565687229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/1473","id":565687229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTY4NzIyOQ==","user":{"login":"davidzollo","id":15833811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMzODEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15833811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo","html_url":"https://github.com/davidzollo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidzollo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-14T05:59:28Z","updated_at":"2019-12-14T05:59:28Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"good idea， but English is needed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dolphinscheduler/issues/comments/565687229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
