@sijie @merlimat ,\r\nHi, I made a pr https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3398/ for this issue , tried to add a zknode for mutex(to be honest, it's only a short way like queue size is one, could not a best way).\r\n\r\nRight now, what I think we could have 2 other ways to do **retry** thing except this one:\r\n- 1, use zk sequential node for a queue to do retry , could be smarter to do retry but more logics in code , like check the sequence of request.\r\n- 2, use simple retry like sleep a while and retry until the timeout , but cant guarantee grant order is same as the request order .\r\n\r\nany ideas ?

Topics are the lowest unit of assignments to brokers and a topic is served by only 1 broker at a given point in time.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Pulsar supports partitioned topics too (http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/admin-api-partitioned-topics.html#docsNav). If a topic is partitioned, it will be basically composed of multiple partitions (which are seen by the broker as independent topics). Different partition can thus be split into different namespace bundles.\r\n\r\nTo summarize: if the load on a topic is expected to be \"high\" (more than what 1 single node can comfortably sustain), then you should enable partitioning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/457298397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/457302135","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3408#issuecomment-457302135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3408","id":457302135,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzMwMjEzNQ==","user":{"login":"merlimat","id":62500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat","html_url":"https://github.com/merlimat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merlimat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-24T18:19:36Z","updated_at":"2019-01-24T18:19:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@chowyu08 This looks like an empty callback object being passed.

Suppose this case, I have one topic which has partioning enabled and the routing mode used for publishing messages is key hash. There are some producers and each one is reading the data from a file(the file could be created by other programs by any time, it is named by a incremental number) and publishing the data to the topic. We use file name as the hash key and suppose the load from all files is distributed on the partitioned topics. However, it is possible that some files hashing into one partitioned topic could make the certain topic hot.\r\n\r\nBTW, we use key hash as the routing mode is because we want the data in each file is handled in order, so we can not use round-robin mode.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/457595827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/457600530","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/3404#issuecomment-457600530","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3404","id":457600530,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzYwMDUzMA==","user":{"login":"bputt","id":946047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjA0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt","html_url":"https://github.com/bputt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bputt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T15:02:13Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T15:02:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"broker side, more or less, when downloading the tar.gz from pulsar's website","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/457600530/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/457626923","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/3434#issuecomment-457626923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/3434","id":457626923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NzYyNjkyMw==","user":{"login":"foreversunyao","id":19499755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDk5NzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19499755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao","html_url":"https://github.com/foreversunyao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreversunyao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-25T16:17:17Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T16:17:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"rerun java8 tests","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/457626923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
