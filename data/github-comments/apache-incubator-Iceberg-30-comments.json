I removed the name mapping through a try/catch block to solve that.\r\n\r\nThe original plan is to replace all ID-based `ParquetValueReader` to the name-based readers because the `NameBaseReadBuilder` builds a `ParquetValueReader` that doesn't need any schema ID. That is why I use the original file schema instead of `typeWithIds`. But there is no harm to pass a `MessageType` with IDs to build the name-based readers. so in the latest commit, I use `typeWithIds` for both ways.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/611868767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/611877417","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/908#issuecomment-611877417","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/908","id":611877417,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMTg3NzQxNw==","user":{"login":"XiaokunDing","id":3050222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3050222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing","html_url":"https://github.com/XiaokunDing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaokunDing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-10T04:55:15Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T04:55:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

As for the reader, the input and output are clear as the delete files would be extracted from `FileScanTask` and the output would be iterable of `InternalRow` or `GenericRecord`. While for the writer, I 'm not very sure since how metadata-level delete will be implemented. For the spark engine, I could imagine two possible ways:\r\n\r\n- spark build the table scan with the filter expression and projection of the partition columns and metadata columns then save the data frame in append mode with an option like `data=diff`. In this case, Iceberg can generate partition level delete files from the input partition. That means we may not need a separate writer, maybe some update in the current table writer.\r\n\r\n- spark has a logical plan `RowDeleteScan` like the table scan, each task read the input file with filter(residual) and then write to delete file.  In this case, we need a separate writer that takes the input file and filter expression as input and writes the filtered records. This would need residual evaluation for every supported format, but we can use `IcebergGenerics` to handle this.\r\n\r\nBoth of them depend on spark side implementation, any thought?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/612837111/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/612969043","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/920#issuecomment-612969043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/920","id":612969043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMjk2OTA0Mw==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-13T16:16:26Z","updated_at":"2020-04-13T16:16:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think it's a good idea to add ORC schema visitors.

First, I think we might want to consider a change-based API, which is related to my comment about not replacing the whole spec. For updating schemas, the API expresses things like addColumn, renameColumn, etc. that correspond to SQL DDL statements. I think it would make sense to have a similar API here:\r\n* `addField(String source, ...)`\r\n* `renameField(String name, String newName)`\r\n* `replaceField(String name, ...)`\r\n* `removeField(String name)`\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how we should pass the transform to `addField` and `replaceField` just yet. We have expressions for the various transforms, so we could use an expression like `addField(\"ts_hour\", hour(\"ts\"))`. We could also add a lot more variations of the method names, like `addHourField`, `addDayField`, etc.\r\n\r\nSecond, I think we are going to need a v1 version and a v2 version. In v1, we have to maintain the order and number of fields, so we are more limited for partition spec evolution: we can rename partition fields, replace existing partition fields with the `void` transform to \"remove\" them, and add new partition fields at the end of the spec. But in v2, we have reliable IDs so we can actually remove fields, replace a field with a different transform (drop days and add hours in the same position), also rename and add partition fields.

When Iceberg loads metadata files, we use classes that extend `IndexedRecord` so that Avro can construct them directly like a specific record. An example of this is `GenericDataFile`.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are cases where the metadata files are read by engines, like the metadata tables. When you read the `entries` metadata table, Iceberg creates tasks out of the manifest Avro files and Spark reads the data as InternalRow directly.\r\n\r\nDelete files would be similar to these cases. If the engine needs to read a delete file, it would be able to use its object model with Avro.

Due to Guava version conflicts with the version of Guava used by Hive all usages of Guava inside Iceberg's classes need to be shaded and reolcated otherwise there are runtime version conflicts which prevent being able to integrate Iceberg and Hive. I would imagine there would be similar issues with anyone using any Iceberg modules via an API and also having their own version of Guava so would recommend applying this across the whole project if possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/616439191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/616545220","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/933#issuecomment-616545220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/933","id":616545220,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNjU0NTIyMA==","user":{"login":"massdosage","id":29457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage","html_url":"https://github.com/massdosage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/massdosage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-20T13:15:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T13:15:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@rdsr
