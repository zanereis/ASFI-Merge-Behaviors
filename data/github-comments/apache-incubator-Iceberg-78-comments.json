So I feel we still need something like a `last-assigned-schema-id`, so that the schemas don't accidentally share the same id and we can backfill the earlier schema and their IDs if necessary. But `last-assigned-schema-id` field should not as a part of the table metadata field because it will be dropped by an old writer. One way to go is to maybe put it in table properties, but there might be better ways.

been thinking about this more and I'm leaning toward trying to work around it. I think the problem is that the Parquet/Avro writer uses the old list format by default to avoid breaking existing pipelines. But there should be an easy way to update the behavior to produce records that Iceberg accepts by setting `parquet.avro.write-old-list-structure=false`. That's true by default.\r\n\r\nIf we can fix it that way, then I think we should go with that. Otherwise, we're implementing only part of the [backward-compatibility rules from Parquet](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#lists). I'm not sure what the impact would be on compatibility if we only partially implement the rules, so I think the safer thing is to just implement all of the backward-compatibility rules. But that's a bigger change and more to maintain (which is why we don't support the 2-level lists in the first place). So I think the preferred solution is to avoid this instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/775451501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/775490924","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2208#issuecomment-775490924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2208","id":775490924,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NTQ5MDkyNA==","user":{"login":"caseylucas","id":517834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/517834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas","html_url":"https://github.com/caseylucas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caseylucas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-08T21:58:37Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T21:58:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@stevenzwu Thanks for the advice.

So I feel we still need something like a `last-assigned-schema-id`, so that the schemas don't accidentally share the same id and we can backfill the earlier schema and their IDs if necessary. But `last-assigned-schema-id` field should not as a part of the table metadata field because it will be dropped by an old writer.

We actually tried implementing a custom sink that can determine the table name at runtime, but I faced trouble when trying to generate the table name based on the key. I was not able to get the key in the sink based on which I want to name my table. I see that there's a `getCurrentKey()` function in the KeyedProcessFunction, but that was not available in the sink. Couldn't find anything that can help (with passing the data from the source to sink) in the Sink.Context available. Can you think of anything that can help me with this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/776110864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/776115096","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2208#issuecomment-776115096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2208","id":776115096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NjExNTA5Ng==","user":{"login":"stevenzwu","id":1545663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenzwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenzwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-09T17:41:13Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T17:41:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I probably missed sth here. can't you get the key from payload/record?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/776115096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/776120425","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2221#issuecomment-776120425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2221","id":776120425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NjEyMDQyNQ==","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-09T17:49:27Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T17:49:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I don't if it's a common use case but our use case is:\r\n> \r\n> 1.

I would like to create the corresponding manifest files and the first snapshot using the existing files.\r\n\r\nWhen I sketched the code I found that I was listing the partitions / creating `DataFile` objects / creating a new Iceberg table and adding the data files to it. And then I have found that you have already did the same in the `Actions.migrateHive2Iceberg`. At first glance there is not too much Flink specific code in this change. Would it be hard to create a general tool for the migration instead of a Flink specific action?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeter","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/779213255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/779398025","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2232#issuecomment-779398025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2232","id":779398025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3OTM5ODAyNQ==","user":{"login":"danielcweeks","id":4925077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjUwNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4925077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks","html_url":"https://github.com/danielcweeks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielcweeks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-15T18:52:09Z","updated_at":"2021-02-15T18:52:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks

I have just found this PR when I was wondering how to migrate existing Hive tables to Iceberg tables.\r\n> My use-case is that I have an existing Hive table, and I would like to convert it to a Hive table backed by an Iceberg table in-place, and without moving the actual data. I would like to create the corresponding manifest files and the first snapshot using the existing files.\r\n> \r\n> When I sketched the code I found that I was listing the partitions / creating `DataFile` objects / creating a new Iceberg table and adding the data files to it. And then I have found that you have already did the same in the `Actions.migrateHive2Iceberg`. At first glance there is not too much Flink specific code in this change. Would it be hard to create a general tool for the migration instead of a Flink specific action?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks,\r\n> Peter\r\n\r\nWe can make a tool to do this migration work, just like the snapshot expired, iceberg provides Java api and a spark action, but for some large hive tables, if it is only done through the Java api, it may be very slow, using  the engine (spark or flink) can increase the speed of migration. If we only migrate a small hive table, we can run the flink program on our own machine, just like a test case.

As more services add support for Iceberg, should we extract the common logic to have a `ObjectStorageFileIO` in core? @rdblue what do you think?\r\n\r\nI think it may not worth to abstract the `ObjectStorageFileIO`.  In this PR we could see that aliyun `OSSFileIO` is quite similar to aws `S3FileIO` because aliyun object storage services are defining their API which are quite similar to aws API (When I implements the OSSMockApplication, I found that most of the arguments & API names are the same),  though we could make abstraction between aliyun & aws,  azure & google cloud storage API will be a quite different story,  we won't know whether does the abstraction match azure blob storage or GCS unless we implement the azure blob storage `FileIO` and GCS `FileIO`. \r\n\r\n> 2. I really like the approach for the mock application, but it feels that the whole thing can be published by aliyun for Iceberg to import. So just curious, any plan for that in the long term?\r\n\r\nAliyun Object storage services team is another team in our company,  seems currently they don't have the plan to maintain in their aliyun oss sdk release.  For our iceberg integration work,  we are just depending on few APIs so we don't have to maintain all the API from the aliyun official documents ( It's actually lightweight enough to get this OSSMockApplication in iceberg repo).  Another side, according to my observation, aliyun OSS API has been relatively stable for a long time, the maintenance cost is controllable for us. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/781005093/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/781040286","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/issues/2068#issuecomment-781040286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2068","id":781040286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTA0MDI4Ng==","user":{"login":"electrum","id":9230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum","html_url":"https://github.com/electrum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/electrum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-18T04:25:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-18T04:25:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One more thing to add to the spec is that identity columns don’t need to be present in the data file, since that is the case for Hive files.

Or did I misunderstand your question? If you were actually referring to `newAppender`, since the creation of `ContentFile` that stores sort order information is outside the responsibility of `FileAppender`, the caller of it that creates data/delete file is responsible for passing the sort order around. I think it's the same reason as why we created `DataWriter`.\r\n\r\n> the methods you updated are basically not used\r\n\r\nYes, in this PR I was trying to add capability of passing sortOrder info to writers within Iceberg library. I did think about expanding the support to `SparkWrite` but eventually felt a bit hesitant to do so, since at the time when I worked on this PR, in Spark community the sort order design was in an early phase, and I wasn't sure if my assumption on how sort order information comes from in `SparkWrite` is accurate, that I'd rather let people who are the expert in individual engines to do this integration with library writers since they have to also integrate with engine anyway. I think the row level delete support is also in this style - `SparkAppenderFactory` constructor could take in row level delete related arguments, but `SparkWrite` and other spark code are not using such constructor yet. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/781664020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/781751681","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2092#issuecomment-781751681","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2092","id":781751681,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTc1MTY4MQ==","user":{"login":"XuQianJin-Stars","id":10494131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk0MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10494131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars","html_url":"https://github.com/XuQianJin-Stars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T01:31:36Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T01:31:36Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"hi @rdblue would you please take another look at this PR at your convenience.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/781751681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/comments/781758990","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/iceberg/pull/2092#issuecomment-781758990","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/issues/2092","id":781758990,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTc1ODk5MA==","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-19T01:53:46Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T01:53:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Will do.
