As of now I am evaluating hudi with our existing data lake architecture. It seems to integrate well. But I do have few queries though\r\n\r\n1. Athena and Redshift spectrum supports querying CoW hudi table now. Will it add support for MoR as well in the near future ?\r\n2. Will AWS Glue natively support  hudi in the future ?\r\n3. Will you be adding support for cloudwatch metrics ?\r\n4. Is it possible to enable hive sync feature for AWS Glue Catalog ? \r\n5. I also tried running the 0.6.0-rc1 build on AWS Glue. The job kept on running even after it has written the data successfully. Then I had to kill it manually. It happened once in 0.5.3 as well.

I have heard back from the Service team, and here's why such behavior has been observed when querying Apache Hudi tables:\r\n\r\nWhen running 'SELECT COUNT(1)' queries on Hudi tables using HoodieParquetInputFormat, Athena has to bypass it's own implementation of S3 file listing. Thus Hudi tables can be much less efficient in a query where the bottleneck is the speed at which files are listed. The Apache Hudi community is already aware of there being a performance impact caused by their S3 listing logic[1], as also has been rightly suggested on the thread you created.\r\n\r\nFurther, 'SELECT COUNT(1)' queries over either format are nearly instantaneous to process on the Query Engine and measure how quickly the S3 listing completes. If you instead compare performance on more complex queries (that require meaningful work on both sides), you should see a less pronounced difference in the results.\r\n\r\nI hope this information helps. Feel free to reach out to me with any additional queries you may have on this topic. I will be glad to assist you!\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1].

Can you take a look at the tests to see what the difference is ?\r\n\r\n@bvaradar I checked `hudi-integ-test` package and found the reason:\r\nIn `hudi-integ-test` pom.xml where contains `ITTestHoodieDemo`, hudi contains `hudi-exec-2.3.1` In pom dependencies. So that if we new a `MapredParquetInputFormat` class, hudi will use this class by `hudi-exec-2.3.1`.\r\n```java \r\npackage org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.Utilities;\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.vector.VectorizedInputFormatInterface;\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.read.DataWritableReadSupport;\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.read.ParquetRecordReaderWrapper;\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.io.ArrayWritable;\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.io.NullWritable;\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.mapred.FileInputFormat;\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.mapred.InputSplit;\r\nimport

VectorizedInputFormatInterface {\r\n```\r\nBut if we just use a standalone spark environmental without hive-2.3.1 dependencies (like starting a new project and only depend spark lib), hudi will use `hive-exec-1.2.1-spark2`.\r\n```java\r\npackage org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport org.apache.commons.logging.Log;\r\nimport

@bvaradar - thanks for the reply! And for the suggestion.\r\n\r\nIn our use case, we're interested in both incremental read of material changes, and in using the Hudi table with regular snapshot queries. I would expect 30-50% incremental reads, and 50-70% snapshot queries.\r\n\r\nIf I'm understanding correctly, your suggestion would essentially lead to an event log of all material changes to an entity. If you do a snapshot query against that data, you'd end up with lots of duplicates, so each query would need to include de-duplication to reproduce the a materialised view with the latest data for each entity.\r\n\r\nIs that right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/679017460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/comments/679026628","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/1979#issuecomment-679026628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1979","id":679026628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3OTAyNjYyOA==","user":{"login":"hughfdjackson","id":545689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTY4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/hughfdjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughfdjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-24T09:46:27Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T09:51:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@bvaradar - As a follow-up question, your reply confirms that what we're looking for (ideally) isn't a Hudi feature currently.
