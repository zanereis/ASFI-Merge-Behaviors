This is similar to the behaviour in the producer when attempting to send a message to a partition when metadata is unavailable either because the topic doesn't exist or the leader is not known. The reason I was thinking of excluding `UnknownTopicOrPartitionException` initially was because this can be a result of a non-existent topic or an unauthorized topic. I didn't exclude this in the PR because this exception during fetch in the consumer and for send in the producer retry metadata refresh, so thought it was better to keep the code consistent. What do you think?\r\n\r\nYes, I will move the PR to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4631. I think it means closing and creating a new one for that. Will do that now.

Thank you for the review. In most cases, old client will be waiting for server token inside the SASL authenticator and will treat the error code as a SASL challenge and fail to authenticate. It is also possible that a (eg. non-Java) client finishes authentication without waiting for data from server and treats the error code as a Kafka response and fails to parse the response. Either way, since the server disconnects straight after sending the error code, the client will process the disconnection and continue to re-create connections as today (treating authentication failures as connection failures).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283395217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283401129","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2614#issuecomment-283401129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2614","id":283401129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzQwMTEyOQ==","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T17:00:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T17:00:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"FYI: System tests run here: http://confluent-kafka-branch-builder-system-test-results.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2017-03-01--001.1488358155--confluentinc--exactly-once-message-format--c2a14f8/report.html.

Thanks for reviewing the patch. This KIP depends on the KAFKA-4820 and I will rebase the patch after KAFKA-4820 is committed. And I will also explain the PurgeDataCommand in the mailing thread and the KIP wiki.\r\n\r\nInitially we considered to use purge, truncate or delete in the method name. I don't have a strong preference among them. I chose purge because Joel/Becket prefers it and no one else raises concerns with it in the open source discussion. I think one reason is to distinguish it from `deleteTopic` method. Now that we have `data` in the name, I agree that it may be better to use `deleteDataBefore`. Let me propose it in the open source mailing list.\r\n\r\nI think the purpose of including `data` in the method name is to distinguish it from `deleteTopic` method name. The reason of not having `data` in the API name PurgeRequest is because `ProduceRequest` or `FetchRequest` doesn't include `data` in the name.\r\n\r\nThe reason of including `before` in the method name is because we may want to have a method to delete data after a given offset in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283426390/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283437367","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2623#issuecomment-283437367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2623","id":283437367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzQzNzM2Nw==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T19:07:14Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T19:07:14Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

Thanks for providing an example. In addition to the increased time-complexity for per-node operation, I think your patch is less efficient in the sense that `pendingRequestCount()`, `failUnsentRequests()` still requires global lock which means the user thread may block on these methods while another thread is blocked waiting on the `nioSelector.select(ms)`. In addition, your patch assumes that private methods such as `trySend()` must be called while holding the global lock, because otherwise one request may be sent multiple times when multiple threads call `trySend()`. This assumption is correct as of now, but is kind of error prone if some developer doesn't know about this and simply calls `trySend` without having the global lock.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283468609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283471445","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2624#issuecomment-283471445","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2624","id":283471445,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzQ3MTQ0NQ==","user":{"login":"asfbot","id":5243949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM5NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot","html_url":"https://github.com/asfbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T21:11:33Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T21:11:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\nRefer

In addition to the increased time-complexity for per-node operation, I think your patch is less efficient in the sense that pendingRequestCount(), failUnsentRequests() still requires global lock which means the user thread may block on these methods while another thread is blocked waiting on the nioSelector.select(ms).\r\n\r\nThe method `pendingRequestCount()` must acquire the \"global\" lock protecting `NetworkClient` anyway, right? And `failUnsentRequests` does not actually need the lock since the unsent collection is safe to iterate concurrently.\r\n\r\n> In addition, your patch assumes that private methods such as trySend() must be called while holding the global lock, because otherwise one request may be sent multiple times when multiple threads call trySend(). This assumption is correct as of now, but is kind of error prone if some developer doesn't know about this and simply calls trySend without having the global lock.\r\n\r\nThis makes no sense to me. If you are concerned about the assumption, either make the synchronization explicit by acquiring the necessary lock within `trySend` or just add some documentation. In your patch, we also have to make assumptions about locking order which a developer might not be aware of, right? Either way, we depend on reviewers to make sure developers don't do dumb things.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of the approach is that it is easier to understand. For concurrent code, that is a rather big win. If you really insist on adding a second lock, then I'd recommend following the pattern suggested by Ismael above. However, at the moment, I don't see a compelling reason to increase complexity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283476997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/comments/283481245","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/2619#issuecomment-283481245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/2619","id":283481245,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MzQ4MTI0NQ==","user":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-01T21:47:51Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T21:47:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@hachikuji I agree that `pendingRequestCount()` needs global lock anyway so it is not an issue.

There's enough trickiness here already without having to think about the thread safety of callbacks and nondeterministic orders of invocations. If we want `failUnsentRequests()` to be non-blocking, maybe we could add the associated `Node` to a local collection and then do the actual work within `poll()`. Then we could use `wakeup()` to interrupt another thread in the middle of poll().

I think your solution would work. Strictly speaking my patch is better in the sense that 1) the per-node operation is faster and 2) `failUnsentRequests(..)` can be executed while `client.poll()` holds the lock and still make sure that callback will not be invoked concurrently (because they are protected by `synchronize(unsent)`). But I am fine with this since the performance impact should be small. Both Becket and I think the code may be a bit simpler using `synchronized(unsent)` than using `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` but such opinion is subjective and there is no need to argue over
