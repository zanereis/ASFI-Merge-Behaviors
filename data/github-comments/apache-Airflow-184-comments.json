At some point I want to write a guide for local development and will just add that in :).

But I am not sure if I like this change. 1. From UI perspective, there will be two places to do the triggering dag which is kinda redundant; 2. The DAG page is a page for DAG information, not for operation(delete dag run, modify dag run, trigger dag run are in a different page). If we add this button, I think people may also argue whether we should add a stop dag run, modify dag run etc button(which are operations related to the dag) to this page.\r\n\r\nJust my
