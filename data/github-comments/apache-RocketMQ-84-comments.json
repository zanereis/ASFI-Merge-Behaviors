Go SDK did not start consumption from nextBeginOffset, so the offset is always 0. I think this does not mean that offset=0 has been checked, but because the data corresponding to offset=0 has expired, resulting in log exceptions.\r\n\r\nRegarding the state OFFSET_FOUND_NULL, my understanding is that the first offset is 0, then nextBeginOffset is corrected to 300000, the next time org.apache.rocketmq.store.DefaultMessageStore#getMessage enters the parameter offset is 300000, and then nextBeginOffset is corrected to 600000...Finally, The correct offset will be found. I think the problem is in the go client.

Go SDK did not start consumption from nextBeginOffset, so the offset is always 0. I think this does not mean that offset=0 has been checked, but because the data corresponding to offset=0 has expired, resulting in log exceptions.\r\n> > > \r\n> > > \r\n> > > Regarding the state OFFSET_FOUND_NULL, my understanding is that the first offset is 0, then nextBeginOffset is corrected to 300000, the next time org.apache.rocketmq.store.DefaultMessageStore#getMessage enters the parameter offset is 300000, and then nextBeginOffset is corrected to 600000...Finally, The correct offset will be found. I think the problem is in the go client. Don't know if my understanding is correct\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > Yes. According to the normal processing, the offset will continue to find the next file. This problem should be manifested in the java sdk, but because OFFSET_FOUND_NULL will not be processed in the GO SDK, the query will continue from offset=0 next time. I fixed this problem in ISSUE [#732](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-go/pull/732).\r\n> \r\n> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29321745/137432680-d47dae3a-27c5-4ad7-b415-76b419720fee.png) I think there is no need to judge here, nextBeginOffset must be less than maxOffset\r\n\r\nAfter a debug verification, the situation of nextBeginOffset>maxOffset does not appear. During the verification process, it was found that because minOffset=0 (actual minOffset=80w+), data was continuously pulled every nextBeginOffset+800. So there is a problem with minOffset recording.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/944072692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/944254150","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/3418#issuecomment-944254150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/3418","id":944254150,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl844SCzG","user":{"login":"coveralls","id":2354108,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTQxMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2354108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls","html_url":"https://github.com/coveralls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coveralls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T12:22:42Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T12:22:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/builds/43533697/badge)](https://coveralls.io/builds/43533697)\n\nCoverage increased (+0.2%) to 54.676% when pulling **6120b9748c320decb01ace0e45ccbac489eb4483 on caigy:ease_client** into **a2c6d33a2b85fea5b12ad41be16ad1ed85c993bb on apache:develop**.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/944254150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/comments/944922231","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/2937#issuecomment-944922231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2937","id":944922231,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHrsl844Ul53","user":{"login":"loongs-zhang","id":38336731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MzM2NzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38336731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/loongs-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loongs-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-16T14:18:14Z","updated_at":"2021-10-16T14:18:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There was something wrong with my QQ email.
