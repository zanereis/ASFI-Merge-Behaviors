but then in the middle of the second epoch slows to a crawl, as well the perplexity metric gets stuck at ~ 11\r\n(btw I had a bug in the perl layer which was essentially of not linking states between lstm sequence layers and my network was getting stuck at the same 11 , I wonder if you have similar bug in mkl implementation).\r\nNow looking at the OpenBLAS (running the same exact code, one difference is that mshadow uses openblas instead of mkl) , the performance starts twice as slow but never degrades and the network converges reliably and quickly with perplexity metric going down to ~ 5 as it should (julia examples have the same number)\r\nAnd when I run the same code on OSX using USE_BLAS=apple I get the same exact results as with OpenBLAS on Linux.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/285599033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/285602141","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/5301#issuecomment-285602141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5301","id":285602141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTYwMjE0MQ==","user":{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-10T07:54:39Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T07:54:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"please

Would it be possible/reasonable to have the ability to pass in sequence_length information to the bidirectional cell?

In this implementation (same as Fused) Given input 1 2 3 0 0 , the bidirectional unroll works in two steps:\r\n1. Forward unroll and produce hidden states of 1 2 3 0 0. Backward unroll and produce hidden states of 0 0 3 2 1.\r\n2. Reverse the backward unroll hidden states from 0 0 3 2 1 into 1 2 3 0 0 and then concatenate with the forward hidden states of 1 2 3 0 0.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that the backward unroll starts with 0 0 first, which probably impacts the vanilla RNN. To solve it, it would be great if the unroll takes in a mask or actual length for the padding so that unroll doesn't actually happen on those values. Besides FusedRNN, in mxnet we will need conditional branching operator to make it work.\r\n\r\nGiven that my goal is to first provide parity for bidirectional unroll in FusedRNN, I'd suggest that we attempt the conditional unroll in a separate pr if that's OK.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/285933970/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/285934650","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/pull/5337#issuecomment-285934650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5337","id":285934650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTkzNDY1MA==","user":{"login":"fhieber","id":2027990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjc5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2027990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber","html_url":"https://github.com/fhieber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhieber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-12T10:07:32Z","updated_at":"2017-03-12T10:07:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Makes

I may be totally misreading it, but it looks like it using a separate model in each of the mapPartitions. Then once you have an rdd of models, it returns the first model which is only representative of one partition of data. So it seems like some of the data would not be represented, if there was more than 1 partition. If this is the case, I guess I am a little confused on how this is distributed, since everything has to be on a single node to work correctly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/285943611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/285954061","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5354#issuecomment-285954061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5354","id":285954061,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTk1NDA2MQ==","user":{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-12T15:59:30Z","updated_at":"2017-03-12T15:59:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Try to read some codes here: https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/_ctypes/ndarray.py#L155","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/285954061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/comments/285956493","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/issues/5330#issuecomment-285956493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/5330","id":285956493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTk1NjQ5Mw==","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-12T16:36:59Z","updated_at":"2017-03-12T16:36:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Model parameters are stored in parameter-server, which is pulled by workers during training.
