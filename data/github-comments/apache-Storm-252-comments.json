href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=howardhl\">howardhl</a>:</i>\n<p>We find that there is already a Blacklist in storm scheduling, which is used in Isolation scheduler. We decide to reuse this Blacklist. The only thing we will do is to add the unstable nodes to the blacklist, and leave the real scheduling to the underlying scheduler (Default Scheduler for now). <br/>\nSome configs:<br/>\n1.\t<b>blacklist.scheduler.tolerance.time.secs</b>: The number of seconds that the blacklist scheduler will concern of bad slots or supervisors. Default: 5 min.<br/>\n2.\t<b>blacklist.scheduler.tolerance.count</b>: The number of hit count that will trigger blacklist in tolerance time. Default: 3.<br/>\n3.\t<b>blacklist.scheduler.resume.time.secs</b>: The number of seconds that the blacklisted slots or supervisor will be resumed. Default: 30 min.<br/>\n4.\t<b>blacklist.scheduler.reporter</b>: The class that the blacklist scheduler will report the blacklist. We do not want storm to add blacklist silently, the blacklist add action may be reported via email or so on. Default: org.apache.storm.scheduler.blacklist.reporters.LogReporter<br/>\n5.\tblacklist.scheduler.strategy: The class that specifies the eviction strategy to use in blacklist scheduler. Default: org.apache.storm.scheduler.blacklist.strategies.DefaultBlacklistStrategy.</p>\n\n<p>The blacklist scheduler maintains a cached supervisors map, comparing all the incoming supervisors to the cache, add new to the cache and remove the ones which is never exist in tolerance time (We can assume that they have already been removed from cluster, if not, they will be added back to cache as soon as they appear again).<br/>\nThe blacklist scheduler also maintains a circular buffer with a fix length of <em>torerance.time / monitor.freq</em> as a slide window. On every time of scheduling ,the bad slots or supervisors will be added to the slide window. (We implement circular buffer ourselves instead of the disruptor RingBuffer inside storm, which I think is not used for slide window. This is to be discussed.)<br/>\nThe blacklist map in blacklist scheduler is map with a key of node info and value of <em>resume.time / monitor.freq</em> while initializing which will be decreased by 1 on each schedule time and finally removed when it hits 0. The nodes that appear more than tolerance.count times in slide window will be add to the blacklist map discussed above.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612952810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/244890794","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1565#issuecomment-244890794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1565","id":244890794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDg5MDc5NA==","user":{"login":"vesense","id":6711230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTEyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense","html_url":"https://github.com/vesense","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T08:58:07Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T08:58:07Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@HeartSaVioR

I like the concept here, and if a supervisor is appearing/disappearing a lot we probably do want to blacklist that supervisor.  That said I have a few system concerns.\n\n1) I would like to see this feature made a part of nimbus, and not so much be a scheduler.  The algorithm is generic enough that we could easily wrap all of the schedulers.  If you let nimbus hand it the scheduler that it is supposed to wrap through the constructor, then you can make the internals agnostic to the scheduler underneath.  This would also fix some of the build dependency issues you where having with needing to build blacklising after building clojure.\n2) I like having the reporting plugin, but I really want to see blacklisted nodes show up on the storm UI.  We have the supervisor pages now, and the supervisor table on the main page.  If I am an administrator I would much rather look at a UI to see what is happening with a supervisor instead of parsing a lot of logs.\n3) Cluster wide failures.  Blacklisting is a good feature until something odd happens and the entire cluster is blacklisted.  (completely theoretical) Lets say that we have nimbus HA and it is the primary nimbus nodes that gets lots of network loss.  After a while it blacklists the entire cluster, when it is just nimbus that is bad.  I want to be sure that we have something in place that can detect and handle appropriately a situation where the majority of the nodes appear to be bad.\n4) master.  This patch is just for the 1.x branch.  That is fine, but before we can merge it in we need a patch for master as well.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/244952101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/244953937","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1673#issuecomment-244953937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1673","id":244953937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDk1MzkzNw==","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T13:43:25Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T13:43:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HeartSaVioR thanks, I should have looked more closely at the conflict.\n\n+1 post-merge\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/244953937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/244965373","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1674#issuecomment-244965373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1674","id":244965373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDk2NTM3Mw==","user":{"login":"vesense","id":6711230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTEyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense","html_url":"https://github.com/vesense","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vesense/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T14:21:16Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T14:21:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Agree with @revans2 's opinion.

The more common case would be if a ZK nic was bad, that could cause this.  But that is beside the point.  There are lots of different things that could make most of the cluster look bad or actually go bad for real.  I am fine with detecting/handling some cases that we know about and can reproduce, but we should have some sort of default catch all.\n\nFor example if HDFS loses too many nodes it goes into read only mode, but for YARN it ignores it but uses metrics to alert the cluster owners.  If we feel that because we are primarily compute, like YARN and want to have a metric about how many nodes are blacklisted that seems like a perfectly fine default.  If we run into other situations and can detect/auto-correct them even better.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/244997562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612887119","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/issues/5477#issuecomment-2612887119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/5477","id":2612887119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTI4ODcxMTk=","user":{"login":"jira-importer","id":99357308,"node_id":"U_kgDOBewSfA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99357308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer","html_url":"https://github.com/jira-importer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jira-importer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T16:07:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T16:08:54Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"<i><a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=liurenjie1024\">liurenjie1024</a>:</i>\n<p>I've proposed a patch for this issue but the PMC does not accept that.</p>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/2612887119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/comments/245050805","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/1674#issuecomment-245050805","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/1674","id":245050805,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NTA1MDgwNQ==","user":{"login":"knusbaum","id":1819836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTk4MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1819836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum","html_url":"https://github.com/knusbaum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knusbaum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-06T18:49:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-06T18:49:11Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"We could just have some \"relative badness\" heuristic.

I think everything is ready to go except a final squash before merging it.  The unit tests all pass, I have run some basic manual tests with CGroups and run as user enabled.  I have run a number of manual tests on my mac, including rebalancing, killing the workers, killing the supervisor, and going back and forth between old and new supervisor.  I have manually deleted and added files/directories in storm-dist on the supervisor.  I also ran the full set of the internal yahoo integration tests against it and everything has passed.\n\nI really would like to start rolling this out internally at yahoo, but I want to get as many eyes looking at it to find issues first.  Better here then in production.  On the upside the bugs I have found have been rather easy to debug, and very reproducible because the race conditions have been eliminated when interacting with the

For the suggestions given by @revans2 :\n1) We concerned implement blacklist in nimbus before. As a newbie in storm contribution and clojure, I choose to implement it as a scheduler so I can write the code in Java and has the minimum affect to the storm core so we can control the risk. The BlacklistScheduler now uses the DefaultScheduler underlying, and we can easily edit so code to let it support configuration to any scheduler. I would like to have a try to add the blacklist to nimbus, as I can't wait someone else implement it for us.\n2)Showing blacklist on UI is good idea.\n3)We have the same worry as you do. In the PR I submit this time, we have some code dealing with it. If the cluster have too many blacklist leading to lack of slots, the _DefaultBlacklistStrategy_ will use _releaseBlacklistWhenNeeded_ method to temporarily resume some supervisors from blacklist so we can try to assign some job to it. It's not good enough but at least it's a try. This is definitely a problem, I think there must be a config which can switch on or off the blacklist feature before it's finally stable enougth. @knusbaum talked about some heuristic algorithm, which we also had in our mind before. We think we may use the number of bad slots on one machine and the number of topoplogies they belong to  to calculate the healthiness of a machine.   The idea is not matrue enough so we haven't implement it, and we can write another IBlacklistStrategy to do that. \n\nAs I am a  newbie, there may be  a lot barriers in front of me. I will be grateful if I can have your assistance when I face them.
