Dave pointed out that it does not allow transactional operations on native HBase tables. Also, we still need to load Trafodion code into the region server, so in that sense we are still intrusive, and probably always will be.\n\nThis code allows us to use specific coprocessors for individual tables. That may be a good thing, but it could also be problematic, e.g. if we want to change all the coprocessors.\n\nAbout the need for restarting HBase: If we add a new jar, that would have to be in the classpath of the region server. Wouldn't that require a restart of HBase, regardless of whether we change the hbase_coprocessor_region_classes configuration entry or not?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/172920098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/comments/172924982","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/trafodion/pull/272#issuecomment-172924982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/trafodion/issues/272","id":172924982,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MjkyNDk4Mg==","user":{"login":"svarnau","id":5273190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzMxOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5273190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau","html_url":"https://github.com/svarnau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svarnau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-19T17:23:57Z","updated_at":"2016-01-19T17:23:57Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"jenkins,
