We need to see how stable the netbeans archive server is.\r\n\r\nThe thing to note is that this is not really replacing references to maven central with an URL to the Apache archives. If it would be that case, I would not do it. The actual real change and motivation is to change the URL to our \"legacy\" server:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/3c33616c3afdc4bd7c5d76ebd609afe3babb13ad/extide/o.apache.tools.ant.module/external/binaries-list#L17\r\n\r\nto the Apache archives.

My understanding is that this is because some of the files in the Ant distribution are not on Maven central. I.e. when upgrading Ant, unless the Ant project uploads the whole distribution  to Maven central,  the choice is between using Apache archives, or zip the extra files manually, upload them to osuosl and download them from there. Given we would like (I think) to migrate out of using osuosl, eventually, I think it makes sense to use Apache archives over osuosl. Also, we are an ASF project, and ASF has control over the Apache archives, but not quite over the osuosl server.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1733327363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/comments/1733377733","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/6480#issuecomment-1733377733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/netbeans/issues/6480","id":1733377733,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBhWr-M5nUT7F","user":{"login":"neilcsmith-net","id":3975960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzU5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3975960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net","html_url":"https://github.com/neilcsmith-net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilcsmith-net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-25T10:19:41Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T10:19:41Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Given we would like (I think) to migrate out of using osuosl, eventually, I think it makes sense to use Apache archives over osuosl.
