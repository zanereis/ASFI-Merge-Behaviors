I left some initial comments, and I haven't been able to get it to work yet on my PostgreSQL 12 server. Is there some n00b tutorial you can point me to so I can make sure I set everything up right? I created a publication and a replication slot, but I don't know how/if they work together, and I didn't get any events into the processor.\r\n\r\nConfiguration on PostgreSQL Server\r\n=============\r\n\r\npostgresql.conf\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nYour database should be configured to enable logical replication.\r\n\r\n* Property **max_wal_senders** should be at least equal to the number of replication consumers.\r\n* Property **wal_keep_segments** should contain count wal segments that can't be removed from database.\r\n* Property **wal_level** for logical replication should be equal to logical.\r\n* Property **max_replication_slots** should be greater than zero for logical replication, because logical replication can't work without replication slot.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nlisten_addresses = '*'         \t# what IP address(es) to listen on;\r\n                                # comma-separated list of addresses;\r\n                                # defaults to 'localhost'; use '*' for all\r\n                                # (change requires restart)\r\nmax_wal_senders = 4             # max number of walsender processes\r\nwal_keep_segments = 4           # in logfile segments, 16MB each; 0 disables\r\nwal_level = logical             # minimal, replica, or logical\r\nmax_replication_slots = 4       # max number of replication slots\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter configurations, restart/reload PostgreSQL service.\r\n\r\npg_hba.conf\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nEnable connect user with replication privileges to replication stream and make a statments on PostgreSQL Server.\r\n\r\nExample, Put this lines at pg_hba.conf:\r\n```\r\nhost    all           all              all                     md5 #For SnapShot Connection\r\nhost    replication   all              all                     md5 #For Replication Connection\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter configurations, restart PostgreSQL service.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of Use\r\n===============\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL\r\n----------\r\nCreate a PostgreSQL table, for this example we use a postgres database; JUST FOR LEARNING PURPOSE;\r\n\r\nTable struct:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                Table \"public.cidade\"\r\n  Column   |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default\r\n-----------+---------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n codigo    | integer |           | not null |\r\n data_fund | date    |           | not null |\r\n nome      | text    |           |          |\r\nPublications:\r\n    \"cidade_pub\"\r\n```\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE cidade(codigo integer not null, data_fund date not null, nome text);\r\nALTER TABLE cidade REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;\r\n```\r\n**OBS**: A published table must have a “replica identity” configured in order to be able to replicate UPDATE and DELETE operations, so that appropriate rows to update or delete can be identified on the subscriber side. By default, this is the primary key, if there is one. Another unique index (with certain additional requirements) can also be set to be the replica identity. If the table does not have any suitable key, then it can be set to replica identity “full”, which means the entire row becomes the key. This, however, is very inefficient and should only be used as a fallback if no other solution is possible.
