It should target `3.4-dev` in my opinion. `3.3-dev` would also be possible, but would require a different PR as this part of the driver has changed a lot between 3.3 and 3.4. Since the download numbers for 3.3 releases are very low for Gremlin.Net (only 67 downloads for 3.3.10 and 107 for 3.3.9 right now), I don't think it's worth the effort to backport a small fix like this to `3.3-dev`.\r\n@dzmitry-lahoda We'll merge the change into `3.4-dev` and then merge that branch into `master` if you change the target branch here to `3.4-dev`. That way, the change will land in the next 3.4 release (probably 3.4.7) and also in 3.5.0, whenever that will be released.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/594631143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/595321989","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1250#issuecomment-595321989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1250","id":595321989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTMyMTk4OQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-05T16:32:12Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T16:32:12Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"thanks @dzmitry-lahoda \r\n\r\nVOTE +1 -

does this mean that we have to install multiple versions of .NET to build on the different branches?\r\n\r\nGood question. My understanding was always that the .NET Core SDK is completely backwards compatible which was correct, but what I didn't know is that that doesn't apply to the .NET Core runtimes which we need to execute the tests. I just tried to run the Gremlin.NET tests on `3.4-dev` with only .NET Core SDK 3.1 installed and it failed.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess that the best approach is now to update all release branches to .NET Core 3.1 which is the latest LTS version.\r\nThis has no effect on users of Gremlin.Net as that targets .NET Standard which doesn't need to be changed at all. The only change affecting users is the update in Gremlin.Net.Template, but that is a good thing in my opinion as the template is only used to create a completely new project and then using the latest LTS version sounds like the best approach to me.\r\n\r\nUnless there are any concerns with this approach, I'm going to create a PR that targets `3.3-dev` and update to .NET Core 3.1 there. We can then merge that PR first into all release branches and I will rebase this PR afterwards. That means that all contributors (only) need .NET Core SDK 3.1 for all release branches afterwards.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/597718422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/597752979","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1260#issuecomment-597752979","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1260","id":597752979,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5Nzc1Mjk3OQ==","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-11T17:05:04Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T17:05:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"yes - i'd like to try to keep one docker image for building, which is why i went to extremes to manually install the exact version of python we needed. if SDK 3.1 builds all the release branches then i guess we should go with that across the board. i guess the only downside is that we don't test the older branches explicitly with the version we say we support. \r\n\r\ni'm not sure at what point we \"fork\" our docker images across branches...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/597752979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/598088623","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1260#issuecomment-598088623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1260","id":598088623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODA4ODYyMw==","user":{"login":"FlorianHockmann","id":21224336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21224336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianHockmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T09:27:19Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T09:27:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> i guess the only downside is that we don't test the older branches explicitly with the version we say we support.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean with _the version we say we support_?

I can just try to explain it a bit more detailed as .NET versioning / targeting can be confusing:\r\n\r\nGremlin.NET targets .NET Standard 1.3 and .NET Standard 2.0 right now. Users will include it in their applications that run on a .NET platform like .NET Core, .NET Framework, Mono or Xamarin. This PR drops support for .NET Standard 1.3 on `master` for TinkerPop 3.5.0. That has the effect that for example .NET Core 1.0 is not supported any more and users have to update to .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Since .NET Core 2.0 was released in October 2018 and .NET Core 1.x reached EOL in June 2019, that shouldn't be a big problem. The situation is similar for .NET Framework, Mono and the other platforms. .NET Standard was for example supported by .NET Framework since version 4.6.0, but .NET Standard is only supported since version 4.6.1.\r\nThis information can be found for all .NET Standard versions and platforms [in this table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support).\r\n\r\nWhile we only target .NET Standard with Gremlin.NET, we still need a platform to execute our tests on and to build the project. We use .NET Core for that as it's OS independent and because all .NET platforms seem to be slowly merging into .NET Core, resulting in [.NET 5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/) which will hopefully also make the .NET ecosystem easier to understand.\r\n#1261 now updates our usages of .NET Core from 2.0 to 3.1 so we have the most recent SDK to build the project and to run the tests on .NET Core 3.1.\r\nWe can do that on all release branches because it really only affects our development process (apart from Gremlin.NET template).\r\n\r\nAnd after #1261 is merged, this PR will really only drop support for .NET Standard 1.3.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/598155696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/598175632","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1257#issuecomment-598175632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1257","id":598175632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODE3NTYzMg==","user":{"login":"heljoyLiu","id":18606413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjA2NDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18606413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/heljoyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T13:08:44Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T13:08:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@FlorianHockmann , I will prepare another PR for `3.4-dev` , pls let me know if any wrong, thanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/598175632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/598178555","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1257#issuecomment-598178555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1257","id":598178555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5ODE3ODU1NQ==","user":{"login":"FlorianHockmann","id":21224336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI0MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21224336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianHockmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianHockmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-12T13:14:09Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T13:14:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I will prepare another PR for 3.4-dev , pls let me know if any wrong, thanks.\r\n\r\nThat sounds good, thanks.

Otherwise, the fix to check whether the state is open before calling `ReceiveAsync` wouldn't help.\r\n- @WiredUK mentioned that this happens in just a few seconds after starting his application. So, this is not an issue of Cosmos DB closing connections after a while (as described in [TINKERPOP-2288](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2288)).\r\n- The driver [changed in the meantime](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1250) to now throw a clear message when it received `null` / an empty array.\r\n\r\nIs that summary correct or did I miss anything important or got something wrong?\r\n\r\nWhile reading the comments again, I wonder whether this one actually points to a good possible solution here:\r\n\r\n> Maybe, but then the code gets \"stuck\" inside the while(true), which is a tight loop, waiting for the external connection check, and only exits when an exception happens.\r\n\r\nSo, why not simply replace `while(True)` with `while(IsOpen)` in `Connection.ReceiveMessagesAsync`? If the issue here is that we try to receive messages on a closed connection, then this is the easiest fix in my opinion as we already have the information about the connection state in the `Connection` class. So we don't need to introduce a status object and return that from our `WebSocketConnection` class.\r\n\r\nThe change will actually be a bit more complicated as we need to cancel open requests which results in an exception for the user but I think that this is in general an easier solution to stop calling `ReceiveAsync` on a closed connection.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm however still wondering about is why the connection is not in the `Open` state in the first place. Was it closed by the server? Or by the client? Or is the connection maybe not even open yet when we call `ReceiveAsync` the first time which would explain why @WiredUK sees the exception even within seconds of starting his application.\r\nThe last case would be very surprising to me as we're calling `ReceiveAsync` only after `await`ing for `ConnectAsync`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/607910571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/608182269","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/1275#issuecomment-608182269","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1275","id":608182269,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwODE4MjI2OQ==","user":{"login":"heljoyLiu","id":18606413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjA2NDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18606413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/heljoyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heljoyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-03T01:41:44Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T01:41:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"\r\n>

I'm not sure why we didn't have it this way before. We were already coercing `long()` to `BigInt` so I'm not sure why we wouldn't do the same for int. It makes me wonder if it's an inconsistency to not have an explicit `bigint()` function. I realize that Python developers don't think of numbers the way that Java developers do but if a Java server process explicitly required a `BigInt` and the user needed to send the number `1` of that type they wouldn't have a way to do it.  There is  no need for you to resolve that issue on this ticket, but perhaps it is worth creating a JIRA for it. Perhaps it would only be a feature for {{master}} and 3.5.0.\r\n\r\nFinally, a couple of administrative points: \r\n\r\n1.

For example, if you want a specific number type like `BigInt` explicitly stored in TinkerGraph, you need to pass it to `property()` as that type. That said, Gremlin, the language, will make that underlying number comparable during a query.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/620526498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
