I heard the news from @merrymercy about your thought of quantization, I have implemented the way completely you comment. i.e. import quantized int8 TFLite mode (trained by Tensorflow within Quantization-Aware) and implement the related ops to support. We have supported mobilenet int8 model (http://download.tensorflow.org/models/mobilenet_v1_2018_08_02/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tgz) completely. So I could share the work and current performance data for you and others maybe interested at it \r\n\r\nI list the things we have done to support it:\r\n\r\n- support TFLite model in NNVM frontend.\r\n- Extend the attribute of the convolution (has_quantization, input_zero_point, kernel_zero_point, output_zero_point, output_multiplier, output_shift, output_activation_min, output_activation_max)\r\n- Extend the attribute for others ops like Pooling\r\n- Extend the computation of conv2d to accept quantization params (input_zero_point, kernel_zero_point)\r\n- (Not good enough) implement softmax using GEMMLOWP like libcblas for the sake of quick experiment.\r\n\r\nOur current scheme is int8->int32, the speed up v.s. FP32 is **30%** (MobilenetV1 model). \r\n\r\nCurrently, I am following @merrymercy 's advice ( change the data_vec from uint8 to int16 ). However, we have not found one good way to change the kernel from uint8 to int16 (because we will make kernel subtract kernel_zero_point, so we need signed integer. we can not prepack it like before)\r\n\r\nIf you have any advice or any questions about this work, we can discuss with it together.

For example, during dev, I wanted to investigate the args passed in the builder for debugging purposes. Debugging macros in Rust is not graceful even with [log_syntax or trace_macros](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29598). \r\n\r\n2.

Builder also covers your `syslib.get_function(\"default_function\")` when interacting with already built modules as well as invoking the functions.\r\n\r\n4. `tvm_call` is pretty similar to `call_packed` and I'm for the name change as I suggested in the PR comments before, but right now, `tvm_call` doesn't use `set_output` as in\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction::Builder::from(&mut fadd)\r\n            .arg(&arr)\r\n            .arg(&arr)\r\n            .set_output(&mut ret)\r\n            .invoke()\r\n            .unwrap();\r\n```\r\nwhich I thought this issue is about and making it general can make things more clearer by something like\r\n\r\n```\r\ntvm_call!(fadd; args: &arr, &arr; out: &mut ret)?;\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. I think packed function  `fn(&[TVMArgValue]) -> Result<TVMRetValue>` is more Rusty than `Box<Fn(&[TVMArgValue]) -> TVMRetValue + Send + Sync>`. In fact, [fn function ptr is Fn + Send + Sync + Pointer etc.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.fn.html)\r\n\r\nFinally, frontend needs to be able to register global functions and the whole mechanism fits things together in `register_global_func!`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/448718448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/448738027","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2305#issuecomment-448738027","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2305","id":448738027,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODczODAyNw==","user":{"login":"nhynes","id":2353785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTM3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2353785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes","html_url":"https://github.com/nhynes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nhynes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-19T20:46:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T20:49:02Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Okay, then let's modify `PackedFunc` to return `Result<TvmRetValue>`.

@denis0x0D for the comment, the curent logic appears to be correct. However, it is never-the-less not fast, because everytime we have to look up the callback function by name. Here is a possibly better strategy, which is not that different from current one:\r\n\r\n- Generate a intrinsic function ```tvm_trace(*args)```  in the trace frontend\r\n- In the src/codegen/llvm/codegen_cpu.cc translate tvm_trace intrinsic into logic of call_packed(by using CallPacked, without any return value) and return the corresponding argument correctly.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this way is that we reuse the packed function caching mechanism, so there is not repeatitive lookup of packed functions, it does add a special logic to the code generator block to support tracing (mainly for returning the correct value)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449513656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449514436","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/2232#issuecomment-449514436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2232","id":449514436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTUxNDQzNg==","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-21T22:31:34Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T22:31:34Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"It

heterogeneous execution for Relay is great!\r\n\r\nI have a couple ideas on the implementation though. \r\n\r\nIn general I think we should avoid modifying Relay's AST if possible. \r\n\r\nI'm motivated by a couple simple design choices. If we extend the AST for every feature the AST will quickly become large and complex. The AST is part of the user facing interface (where users are compiler/tool authors) and modifications are transparent to them, requiring us to be careful about backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\nOne design the Relay team has stumbled upon is using synthetic operators (i.e `on_device(expr, device_id=n)`). \r\n\r\nIn this design the user and/or frontend may call the `on_device` operator, its first argument is an arbitrary expression, the result of calling this operator schedules the computation on the device with the id `n`. \r\n\r\nThe annotation pass can simply rewrite the program to place the correct calls to `on_device`, and then during compilation we can rewrite them into the correct communication operations.\r\n\r\nWe should also make the modifications to the planning API as suggested.\r\n\r\nOne good property about this approach is we can easily try out different heterogenous execution strategies in libraries, as well as enabling other backends (such as the 2.0 runtime we have an open RFC on) to compile the `on_device` operator appropriately.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449553124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/comments/449555612","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/2244#issuecomment-449555612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2244","id":449555612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTU1NTYxMg==","user":{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-22T08:43:34Z","updated_at":"2018-12-22T08:43:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I just wanted to write down my thoughts on this whole process. Sorry for the slow response been a busy couple weeks with paper deadlines and the TVM Conference. \r\n\r\nI believe Relay offers multiple benefits as an intermediate representation, as well as quite a few compelling engineering reasons. \r\n\r\nMost importantly Relay has a richer computational model, and is able to represent a wider set of deep learning computations. Providing the ability to represent and optimize programs which contain training loops, as well as advanced models.\r\n \r\nRelay provides a rich and flexible type system allowing us to type the computations represented today in computation graphs as well as new operators, and functionality such as control-flow, recursion. We introduce a mechanism for explicit sharing via `let` bindings which are useful for control-flow and scoping.  We can encode loops and control structures such as (map, filter, fold, etc). \r\n\r\nConcurrently @MarisaKirisame, @slyubomirsky and I have been working on support for data types which allow the definition of differentiable functions over lists, trees, graphs, etc and the ability to optimize them (in the ML and compiler sense). \r\n\r\n@MarisaKirisame and I have been working on a new AD algorithm (not yet merged, see #2321 for the first order version) which can compute Nth order gradients over control structures and data types.\r\n\r\nFrom an engineering standpoint we have made many improvements, from the new attributes system to to new optimizations, and passes.\r\n\r\nThe new attribute system replaces NNVM's parameters. It provides the ability for users to provide typed attribute data (instead of strings), and can be accessed from Python. Attributes are constant, compile time information passed to operators that may be considered when doing analysis such as type checking, or code generation. \r\n\r\nAnother example is Relay supports arbitrary tensor constants. We type constants with tensor types, with 0-rank tensors representing scalars. Constants and their type rules allow us to remove specialized operators, typing, and execution support for scalars.\r\n\r\nWe can further use constants to do things like parameter specific optimization, we simply inline the parameters as constants and invoke the program optimizer. We can now treat all constant values uniformly regardless of whether they are parameters, constants in the program, or any other kind of user supplied information.\r\n\r\nWe are also able to build on Relay infrastructure, such as the program interpreter.  We were able to build a constant evaluator by just using Relay's interpreter. We can execute arbitrary Relay programs, including the user of platform optimized operators. We can then inline the program result as a constant.\r\n\r\n@joshpoll is furthering this line of thought by building a partial evaluator for Relay which can perform constant folding/evaluation style optimizations in the face of the unknown values.\r\n\r\nI believe these are just a few examples of how Relay is helping us do more with less work. An important avenue is making it easier for people to test and evaluate Relay.\r\n\r\nWe have an internal version of  https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/tree/master/apps/benchmark for an older version of Relay which I will work to upstream to aid this effort. If anyone is interested in helping out with this process I would welcome extra hands. \r\n\r\nGoing forward we hope to leverage the hard work done by the Relay community (both here at UW and our great collaborators elsewhere) to continue providing features and engineering benefits. \r\n\r\nMy personal development roadmap for Relay is to focus on error reporting, stability, and features for training. I would love to build a detailed version of the Relay roadmap after the holidays and involve those who are interested in the community.
