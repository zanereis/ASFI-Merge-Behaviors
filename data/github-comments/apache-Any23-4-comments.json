The user could implement either a \"collecting\" triple handler which stores statements in memory prior to transforming them, or a \"streaming\" triple handler for transformation-on-the-fly (e.g., if mapping some predicate A to some other predicate B), or some combination of these two concepts. The \"collecting\" ability could be easily supplemented with a `ModelWriter` or equivalent, as in [ANY23-397](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ANY23-397). The \"streaming\" filtering/mapping ability could be easily implemented by extending the [`CompositeTripleHandler`](https://github.com/apache/any23/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/any23/writer/CompositeTripleHandler.java).\r\n\r\nBut adding a separate \"ModelExtractor\" concept only muddles this already-existing ability to transform triples with TripleHandlers by introducing a redundant construct of more limited abstraction power than what already exists.\r\n\r\nSo for me:\r\n-1 for ANY23-396 (as it currently stands)\r\n+1 for ANY23-397\r\n\r\n@lewismc any thoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/420739261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/420785018","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/121#issuecomment-420785018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/121","id":420785018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDc4NTAxOA==","user":{"login":"jgrzebyta","id":6738268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MzgyNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6738268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta","html_url":"https://github.com/jgrzebyta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgrzebyta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-12T20:24:42Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T20:24:42Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@HansBrende ok.

Since `WriterFactory.getMimeType()` is redundant and I had to deprecate it anyway to make this PR work, I've simply opted to *not* un-deprecate it in the extending `FormatWriterFactory`. To retrieve the MIME type of a `FormatWriterFactory` instance, simply call `getFormat().getDefaultMIMEType()`. However, to keep new implementations of `FormatWriterFactory` backwards compatible with the older behavior, I've simply added the following default implementation of `getMimeType()` in the `FormatWriterFactory` interface:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\n@Deprecated\r\ndefault String getMimeType() {\r\n    return getFormat().getDefaultMIMEType();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Since not all implementations of `FormatWriterFactory` print RDF triples (case in point: `URIListWriterFactory`), the deprecation of `WriterFactory.getRdfFormat()` presents us with the perfect opportunity to make the return type of `getRdfFormat()` more generic in `FormatWriterFactory` (namely, using `FileFormat`, the superclass of `RDFFormat`, instead of `RDFFormat`). To accomplish this, I've simply opted to *not* un-deprecate the `getRdfFormat()` method in the `FormatWriterFactory` interface, and instead, add the following method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nFileFormat getFormat();\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo keep everything backwards compatible with the previous behavior, I've added the following default implementation of `getRdfFormat()` to the `FormatWriterFactory` interface:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\n@Deprecated\r\ndefault RDFFormat getRdfFormat() {\r\n    FileFormat f = getFormat();\r\n    if (f instanceof RDFFormat) {\r\n        return (RDFFormat)f;\r\n    } else {\r\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"This class does not print RDF triples.\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow the `URIListWriterFactory` can utilize the method `getFormat()`, instead of its previous behavior of throwing a `RuntimeException`. To that effect, I've opted to return the following `FileFormat` from `URIListWriterFactory.getFormat()`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate static final FileFormat FORMAT = new FileFormat(\"PLAINTEXT\", \"text/plain\", \r\n                                           StandardCharsets.UTF_8, \"txt\");\r\n@Override\r\npublic FileFormat getFormat() {\r\n    return FORMAT;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Since the `FormatWriterFactory` interface is now not only tasked with `RDFFormat`s, but also arbitrary `FileFormat`s, deprecating the `WriterFactory.getRdfWriter(OutputStream)` method presents us with the perfect opportunity to choose a more appropriate name for this method in the subinterface `FormatWriterFactory`. To this effect, I've opted to simply *not* un-deprecate the `FormatWriterFactory.getRdfWriter(OutputStream)` method, and instead choose a more appropriate name. The name I've provisionally opted for is:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nFormatWriter getFormatWriter(OutputStream);\r\n```\r\nTo keep everything backwards compatible, I've added the following default implementation of `FormatWriterFactory.getRdfWriter(OutputStream)`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\n@Deprecated\r\ndefault FormatWriter getRdfWriter(OutputStream os) {\r\n    return getFormatWriter(os);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Finally, I have one further question for discussion:\r\nWe could use this deprecation opportunity to further genericize the `FormatWriterFactory.getFormatWriter(OutputStream)` method, replacing:\r\n```java\r\nFormatWriter getFormatWriter(OutputStream);\r\n```\r\nwith:\r\n```java\r\nTripleHandler getWriter(OutputStream);\r\n```\r\nwhich would allow `FormatWriterFactory` implementations to return arbitrary `TripleHandler`s instead of forcing them to return the more specific (but arguably *not* more useful) `FormatWriter` implementations. Where behavior specific to `FormatWriter` is actually needed, e.g. `FormatWriter.isAnnotated()` (a method which is actually *never* used anywhere in Any23), a check could be added as follows: \r\n```java\r\nboolean isAnnotated(TripleHandler writer) {\r\n    return writer instanceof FormatWriter ? ((FormatWriter)writer).isAnnotated() : false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne additional benefit of doing this would be that `DelegatingWriterFactory` and `FormatWriterFactory` could both then extend some base interface as follows:\r\n```java\r\ninterface BaseWriterFactory<Output> {\r\n    TripleHandler getWriter(Output o);\r\n}\r\ninterface FormatWriterFactory extends BaseWriterFactory<OutputStream> {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\ninterface DelegatingWriterFactory extends BaseWriterFactory<TripleHandler> {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@lewismc Any

Should any of the new `public` interfaces/methods I have created be named differently, or are they adequately descriptive as they currently stand? This decision should be made now, as there is no going back.\r\n\r\nHere follows the names of all the new `public` methods/interfaces I have created in this PR:\r\n1. `public interface `**`FormatWriterFactory`**\r\n> Is this descriptive enough? It does specify a `FileFormat getFormat()` method, returning the format which will be written to the output stream, so the name does still make sense even though we now return a `TripleHandler` rather than a `FormatWriter` from the `getTripleWriter(OutputStream)` method. On the other hand, we could also call it `ContentWriterFactory` in line with the existing `ContentExtractor` interface (but then again, the `ContentExtractor` interface does *not* specify a similar `getFormat()` method, so we shouldn't force an analogy if none exists). Another possibility would be `OutputStreamWriterFactory`.\r\n2. `public interface`**`DelegatingWriterFactory`**\r\n> Alternatives include `CompositeWriterFactory` or `FilterWriterFactory` (similar to `java.io.FilterOutputStream`) or `WrappingWriterFactory`\r\n3. `TripleHandler`**`getTripleWriter(Output)`** (specified in the `BaseWriterFactory<Output>` interface)\r\n> Alternatives include `getTripleHandler` or simply `getWriter`. I chose `getTripleWriter` over `getWriter` because it seemed more descriptive, and to avoid confusion with the `java.io.Writer` class.\r\n4. `TripleHandler`**`getWriter(id, output)`** and `TripleHandler`**`getDefaultWriter(OutputStream)`** (specified in `WriterFactoryRegistry`).\r\n> This one is confused by the fact that `WriterFactoryRegistry` already uses the term \"writer\" to refer to *`WriterFactory`* instances (e.g. `List<WriterFactory> getWriters()` and `WriterFactory getWriterByIdentifier(String id)`). An easy alternative would be to take a hint from the existing, now-deprecated method `FormatWriter getWriterInstanceByIdentifier(id, output)` and use \"**writerInstance**\" to refer to a triple handler, i.e., `TripleHandler getWriterInstance(id, output)` and `getDefaultWriterInstance(OutputStream)`. Alternatively, we could use `getTripleWriter(id, output)` and `getDefaultTripleWriter(OutputStream)`.\r\n\r\nOut of all of these, I feel pretty good about the existing names for (1), (2), and (3), unless someone can think of something better. However, I feel that (4) should definitely be addressed, for the reason I specified.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, or better names that I haven't thought of, @lewismc ? @jgrzebyta ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/421875571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/422000807","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/122#issuecomment-422000807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/122","id":422000807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjAwMDgwNw==","user":{"login":"HansBrende","id":5846890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5846890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBrende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-17T12:46:59Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T12:46:59Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"After more thought, I'm leaning towards `getWriterInstance()` and `getDefaultWriterInstance()` for (4) of my last comment (in line with the existing method `getWriterInstanceByIdentifier()`).

If we want to add extra utility methods in `WriterFactoryRegistry`, that can be the subject of a different JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did have to fix a couple of synchronization issues in `WriterFactoryRegistry` to accomplish this: I noticed that iterating through the list of writer factories returned by `WriterFactoryRegistry.getWriters()` could potentially throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` even though that method was marked `synchronized` (because, unless I am mistaken, the underlying list implementation *can* be modified after access to the list is given to a caller and the method returns). To fix this problem, I changed the implementation of the backing list of writers from `ArrayList` to `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, which guarantees thread safety for iterators. Since writes to `CopyOnWriteArrayList` are relatively expensive, I also changed the logic around a bit to use *batch writing*, i.e., registering all `WriterFactory` instances at once in a `registerAll()` method, rather than through consecutive invocations of the `register()` method. Similar issues existed for the methods to retrieve identifiers and mime types, which I fixed in the same manner.\r\n\r\nWith this last commit, I am now satisfied, personally, with my implementation of ANY23-396.\r\n\r\nAnything else, @lewismc @jgrzebyta ?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/422217391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/422464626","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/122#issuecomment-422464626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/122","id":422464626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjQ2NDYyNg==","user":{"login":"HansBrende","id":5846890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5846890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBrende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T16:41:35Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T16:50:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I've added a proof-of-concept unit test, which deprecates the `--notrivial` flag and instead makes \"notrivial\" the identifier for a `DelegatingWriterFactory`.

If the user sets a writer's charset to US-ASCII or similar, that could create a problem if the writer doesn't support escaping non-ascii characters. (To my knowledge, only the `NTriplesWriter` and `NQuadsWriter` support this.)\r\n3. The default charset for every existing writer is already UTF-8, and I can't think of a good reason to support anything else.\r\n\r\n**Cleanup item 3:** shorten the identifiers of writer settings for ease of users' CLI usage. (For when, in the future, we actually allow writer settings to be parsed in CLI.)\r\n\r\n**Cleanup item 4:** I can further improve the `TripleWriter` interface by adding support for creating RDF documents that *were not extracted from a previous document*. If the user wants to create an RDF document on the fly, `TripleWriter` seems like the obvious place to do it; however, all the methods require an `ExtractionContext` parameter, which doesn't make sense if the document is not being created in the context of an extraction.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/431532082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/431699916","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/122#issuecomment-431699916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/122","id":431699916,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTY5OTkxNg==","user":{"login":"HansBrende","id":5846890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5846890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBrende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-21T20:10:14Z","updated_at":"2018-10-21T20:10:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lewismc One quick question for you before I finish up here: according to RDF specifications, graph names are allowed to be blank nodes, but it appears that Any23 only supports graph names that are IRIs.

That's what I've done in my latest cleanup commit. \r\n\r\nI'll leave this PR open for at least another day before merging to master just in case anyone comes up with any further comments or concerns.\r\n\r\n## IMPLEMENTATION NOTE\r\nIn my latest revision of `TripleWriter`, I included two new methods:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nvoid writeTriple(Resource s, IRI p, Value o, Resource g) throws TripleHandlerException;\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```java\r\nvoid writeNamespace(String prefix, String uri) throws TripleHandlerException;\r\n```\r\n(analogous to RDF4J's `handleStatement(Statement st)` and `handleNamespace(String prefix, String uri)`) in `org.eclipse.rdf4j.rio.RDFHandler`.\r\n\r\nThese serve to write triples to a document manually, when not in the context of an extraction. I could have also included methods analogous to RDF4J's `startRDF()` and `endRDF()`, but opted not to, for the following reasons:\r\n1. We already have the `close()` method, which serves the same purpose as `endRDF()`, since the default implementation does **not** close the underlying outputstream, but only flushes it.\r\n2. A cursory glance at all of RDF4J's non-NO-OP implementations of `startRDF()` shows it to be redundant and unnecessary. The fact of the matter is, most of RDF4J's writers call `startRDF()` lazily when needed if it has not already been called before writing has begun. And those that don't throw an error if it has been called twice. In either of these cases, the underlying writer is already maintaining a `boolean writerStarted` state variable. Therefore, I see no reason to have the equivalent of RDF4J's `startRDF()` method when the underlying writers already maintain the state needed to call their own `start()` method when necessary, if necessary. (Indeed, in rdf4j's `RDFXMLWriter` implementation, `startRDF` only serves to distract: its **sole** purpose is to throw an exception if it has already been called. The `RDFXMLWriter` defines a separate `writeHeader()` method that is lazily called once before the first triple has been written, because the `RDFXMLWriter` must wait to receive all namespace declarations before *actually* starting the document.)\r\n\r\n## You might ask...\r\nWhy not just use `writer.receiveTriple(s, p, o, g, someFakeExtractionContext)` to manually write to a document? Well, practically speaking, you probably could get away with that, but this would actually violate the specified behavior of the extraction process, and could thus cause unforeseen bugs in implementations that are expecting certain extraction-event methods to be called. To fully simulate the extraction process, you'd have to go through the following rigamarole:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nwriter.startDocument(fakeDocumentIRI);\r\nwriter.openContext(fakeExtractionContext);\r\nwriter.receiveTriple(s, p, o, g, fakeExtractionContext);\r\nwriter.closeContext(fakeExtractionContext);\r\nwriter.endDocument(fakeDocumentIRI);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMuch better to be able to simply say:\r\n```\r\nwriter.writeTriple(s, p, o, g);\r\n```\r\nand know that, if the implementation conforms to the javadoc specification, this single line of code will do what you expect it to do.\r\n\r\n## IMPLEMENTATION NOTE 2 \r\nNote that the signature of the `writeTriple` method uses `Resource g`, not `IRI g`, in accordance with RDF spec.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/431716207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/431857304","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/122#issuecomment-431857304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/122","id":431857304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTg1NzMwNA==","user":{"login":"HansBrende","id":5846890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5846890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBrende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-22T14:48:04Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T14:48:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lewismc If you don't have any more comments, I'm ready to merge this in.\r\n\r\nOne question: would you prefer I squash the commits before merging, or not?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/431857304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/432261802","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/122#issuecomment-432261802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/122","id":432261802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjI2MTgwMg==","user":{"login":"HansBrende","id":5846890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5846890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBrende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-23T14:07:54Z","updated_at":"2018-10-23T14:07:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"On second thought, I'm thinking about making `TripleWriter` a class in `core` rather than an interface in `api`.

I've simplified the code a lot so it should be a whole lot easier to see what's going on now.\r\n\r\nAlso, I improved the UTF-8 detector by reverse engineering jchardet's methodology for UTF-8 detection, and created a UTF-8 state machine which does the same thing as jchardet (in a much more human-readable manner), plus fixed two bugs in jchardet's UTF-8 detector along the way (possibly due to the lack of human-readability in the original source code). \r\n\r\nI started looking into jchardet because, according to [TIKA-2038](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-2038), using it to detect UTF-8 before anything else increased the accuracy of charset detection from ~72% to ~96%. \r\n\r\nOur encoding detector should now be at least as accurate.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the methodology, as compared to what we had before?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/437734011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/comments/438497438","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/any23/pull/132#issuecomment-438497438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/any23/issues/132","id":438497438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODQ5NzQzOA==","user":{"login":"HansBrende","id":5846890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDY4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5846890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende","html_url":"https://github.com/HansBrende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HansBrende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-14T00:59:25Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T00:59:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"See
