It's only about which frameworks we use to build and test it.\r\nGremlin.Net mainly [targets .NET Standard 2.0](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/gremlin-dotnet/src/Gremlin.Net/Gremlin.Net.csproj#L21) which is implemented by various .NET frameworks like .NET 5, .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8. It has .NET 6 as an additional explicit target because we optionally use some APIs which were only introduced in .NET 6 to support Websocket compression. This can therefore only be used by users on .NET 6 and higher.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, we built and tested Gremlin.Net with .NET 6. With this PR, we're using .NET 8 instead. But users can still stay on .NET 6 (or 7 or whatever) and use newer versions of Gremlin.Net with it.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this was clear to you and you just wanted to propose that we **test** against .NET 6 **and** .NET 8. In that case, I agree with you in general that it would be good to test on both frameworks (or better to say runtimes in this case). The problem with that however is that all contributors then also need both runtimes installed. If you just have .NET 8 installed, then the tests will fail as you also need .NET 6 in that case.\r\nThat's also why we always use the same version across all release branches.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the question comes down to how many contributors are actually affected by this and how often do we expect to find version specific bugs because of it. I guess many contributors simply don't execute .NET tests on their machines and leave that up to GH Actions or they use the Docker based setup to execute the tests. So, this probably doesn't affect many contributors.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, [TINKERPOP-3029](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-3029) is also the only bug that comes to my mind which we could have catched by executing tests on different runtimes. Although I think it wouldn't have helped much as we still would have to be on .NET 8 in the first place to find it. So, the better question is how often a bug occurs that is specific to an **older** framework than the latest LTS version which we want to use by default.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong opinion on this. If we are confident that this doesn't really affect contributors negatively, then I'm in favor of executing the tests on multiple runtimes. Otherwise, I'd stay with our current approach.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1924148227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/comments/1927196443","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2478#issuecomment-1927196443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2478","id":1927196443,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAdCfSc5y3q8b","user":{"login":"codecov-commenter","id":65553080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTUzMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65553080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter","html_url":"https://github.com/codecov-commenter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-commenter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-05T14:59:08Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T14:59:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"## [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2478?src=pr&el=h1&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) Report\nAll modified and coverable lines are covered by tests :white_check_mark:\n> Comparison is base [(`d2303d5`)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/commit/d2303d5fad750a2741016babcdba441b57883643?el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) 75.16% compared to head [(`42c4011`)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2478?src=pr&el=desc&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache) 75.44%.\n\n\n<details><summary>Additional details and impacted files</summary>\n\n\n```diff\n@@              Coverage Diff              @@\n##             3.6-dev    #2478      +/-   ##\n=============================================\n+ Coverage      75.16%   75.44%   +0.28%     \n- Complexity     12327    12335       +8     \n=============================================\n  Files           1057     1032      -25     \n  Lines          63496    59724    -3772     \n  Branches        6944     6944              \n=============================================\n- Hits           47729    45061    -2668     \n+ Misses         13198    12282     -916     \n+ Partials        2569     2381     -188     \n```\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n[:umbrella: View full report in Codecov by Sentry](https://app.codecov.io/gh/apache/tinkerpop/pull/2478?src=pr&el=continue&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr+comments&utm_term=apache).   \n:loudspeaker: Have feedback on the report?
