They all passes. For this pr, we just upgraded the Event Hub api version and did not change the functionality, so no new test added.\r\n\r\nWe also test the three components from the Nifi GUI to send/receive events to event hub. Before our updates, processors initialization will fail with ServiceBusException: TransportException (because it uses a really old version of Event Hubs Java client, which uses a really old version of Proton-J, which exhibits this problems when used with current versions of the Java runtime). After the api upgrade, the three components work as expected. Send/receive was successful. ApacheNiFi-eventhub version is also successfully send for us to better understand our customer and provide support.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/540124929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/540125459","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3676#issuecomment-540125459","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3676","id":540125459,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MDEyNTQ1OQ==","user":{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-09T18:19:34Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T18:19:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"ok thanks - glad to hear it regarding the testing.

this PR and it appears to work with the minor issues mentioned by Mike above.\r\n\r\nI'm going to add an additional commit with the following two minor changes...\r\n\r\n1) Move the use of keyPassword inside of the if block for when a keystore is provided because you can't have a keyPassword unless you also have a keystore, and also make keypassword optional, so it looks like this:\r\n```\r\nif (sslContextService.isKeyStoreConfigured()) {\r\n        propertiesBuilder.put(\"keyStorePath\", sslContextService.getKeyStoreFile());\r\n        propertiesBuilder.put(\"keyStorePassword\", sslContextService.getKeyStorePassword());\r\n        propertiesBuilder.put(\"keyStoreType\", sslContextService.getKeyStoreType());\r\n        if (sslContextService.getKeyPassword() != null) {\r\n            propertiesBuilder.put(\"keyPassword\", sslContextService.getKeyPassword());\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Bump the client version from 0.5.3 to 0.8.0 (latest)\r\n\r\nRegarding Mike's other comment about customValidate, this is really incorrect behavior of the schema registry client to require a keystore. I don't think NiFi should implement the logic to force users into that since ideally the schema registry client would get updated to make keystore optional. I will report that issue to the schema registry projected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/540731660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/comments/540924069","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3596#issuecomment-540924069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3596","id":540924069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MDkyNDA2OQ==","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-11T06:09:04Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T06:09:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@jf-beauvais Thanks for the fix.

@volvicoasis @joewitt \r\nIntegration test have been performed. \r\nThe tests was performed using Docker and latest version of IBM MQ and patched Apache NiFi image. The NiFi image was patched with JMS NAR bundle files compiled from code in pull request. Furthermore client library [IBM MQ classes for Java](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.1.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q030520_.htm) was added into the NiFi image.\r\n\r\nTwo test cases was tested. In both cases the objective was to test automatic failover/reconnection. This feature/behaviour is further explained [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/using-websphere-mq-automatic-client-reconnection-websphere-mq-classes-jms).\r\nIn both cases following steps was performed:\r\n1. Put some messages into a MQ message queue. \r\n2. Configure _JMSConnectionFactoryProvider_ controller service with _Broker URI_ property containing list of two brokers (called queue managers in MQ terminology). \r\n3. Run _ConsumeJMS_ processor using _JMSConnectionFactoryProvider_ from previous step.\r\n\r\nIn the first test case the first broker in the list is unreachable, the second broker is running and reachable.\r\nIn the second test case the first broker is running and reachable, the second broker in the list is unreachable.\r\n\r\nThe expected outcome in both test cases is _ConsumeJMS_ outputting 1 or more _flowfiles_. The actual test outcome was as expected, both tests passed.

for the PR @SamHjelmfelt! And thanks for the subsequent commit. This approach feels better and is inline with our existing approach with NiFi. Two additional comments. \r\n\r\n1) When I build, the `dockermaven-stateless` fails because it seems to be running before `nifi-assembly`. Looking at the maven build order, it seems as though the order in the pom is a last resort. Something appears to be allowing the docker builds to run before the `nifi-assembly`. I think we should try to prevent this. I successfully did so by adding a dependency to `nifi-docker` (so all docker projects can benefit) on `nifi-assembly`. \r\n\r\n>     <dependencies>\r\n>         <dependency>\r\n>             <groupId>org.apache.nifi</groupId>\r\n>             <artifactId>nifi-assembly</artifactId>\r\n>             <classifier>bin</classifier>\r\n>             <version>1.10.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n>             <type>zip</type>\r\n>         </dependency>\r\n>     </dependencies>\r\n\r\nIn order for this to work, I had to attach the resulting artifacts in the maven-assembly-plugin configuration of `nifi-assembly`. I am not sure if this is the best solution to this issue.\r\n\r\nThis is arguably a separate concern that we could file a JIRA for addressing in the future.\r\n\r\n2) Once I got the build to execute in the right order, the `dockermaven-stateless` build seems to fail with:\r\n\r\n> [INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:exec (Docker integration tests) @ dockermaven-stateless ---\r\n> [ERROR] Command execution failed.\r\n> java.io.IOException: Cannot run program \"/Users/mgilman/Development/apache/nifi/nifi-docker/dockermaven-stateless/integration-test.sh\"\r\n\r\nThis file appears to have been removed in this PR.

I was able to achieve the same result with an expression like this using just the single argument:\r\n\r\n${\"str\":repeat( ${random():mod(10) } )}     //repeat a random number of times between 0 and 10\r\nor\r\n${\"str\":repeat( ${random():mod(10):plus(10)} )}   //repeat a random number of times between 10 adnd 20\r\n\r\nThis is also JMHO but the function \"repeat(int)\" makes a lot of sense.
