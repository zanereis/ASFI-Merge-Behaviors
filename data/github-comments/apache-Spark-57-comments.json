Maybe the issue is we don't document this clearly enough. Or maybe it's never been established as such.\n\nThe approach taken here changes a property of accumulators - it makes it so the value of an accumulator cannot be accessed until the job is complete. This seems like a loss of functionality. E.g. I could imagine people using accumulators to decide when to terminate a stage (in the future) for things like approximate calculations where you want to stop executing at some point based on an accumulated value.\n\nThe approach here also seems to assume that once a job finishes the stages couldn't ever be re-computed later on. Is that valid? For instance, if you have executor failures that cause shuffle output or RDD partitions to be lost, won't the scheduler need to re-compute partitions in a stage any ways? What if the tasks update accumulator values that are necessary for re-creating that data?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39628971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39629454","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/158#issuecomment-39629454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/158","id":39629454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjI5NDU0","user":{"login":"RongGu","id":2420697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2420697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu","html_url":"https://github.com/RongGu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RongGu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-05T05:25:58Z","updated_at":"2014-04-05T05:25:58Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems that I just missed our last part.

And my reasons are:\n1.  Although not specified in the ScalaDoc, the `numSlices` parameter of `SparkContext.parallelize` specifies the _exact_ partition number of the result RDD. This PR actually changes semantics of the `numSlices` parameter.\n2.  An RDD _can_ have more partitions than its elements. For example, `RDD.filter` may result empty partitions.\n3.  For APIs like `RDD.zipPartitions`, partition number is significant, and this change may break some existing code. For example:\n   \n   ``` scala\n   // Using coalesce to ensure we have exactly 4 partitions\n   val x = sc.textFile(\"input\", 4).coalesce(4) \n   val y = sc.parallelize(1 to 3, 4)\n   val z = x.zipPartitions(y) { (i, j) =>\n     ...\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   (`x.zipPartitions(y)` requires `x` & `y` have exactly the same partition number):\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39637679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39639841","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/332#issuecomment-39639841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/332","id":39639841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjM5ODQx","user":{"login":"AmplabJenkins","id":4031291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzEyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4031291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins","html_url":"https://github.com/AmplabJenkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmplabJenkins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-05T14:27:23Z","updated_at":"2014-04-05T14:27:23Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can one of the admins verify this patch?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39639841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39641216","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/228#issuecomment-39641216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/228","id":39641216,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjQxMjE2","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-05T15:21:04Z","updated_at":"2014-04-05T15:27:23Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi, @pwendell , Thank you for your comments, here is my reply\n\nFirst, \"whether accumulator value should be subject to change in the case of failure\"...I think no, though during a long period, Spark runs in this way (this patch is actually resolving a very old TODO in DAGScheduler.scala)...I think accumulator is usually used to take the task which is more complicate than rdd.count/rdd.filter.count (Maybe I'm wrong), e.g. counting the sum of distance from the points to a potential center in K-means (see mllib), I think in this case, the health status of the cluster should be transparent to the user, i.e. the final result of K-means should be irrelevant to whether executor is lost, etc....\n\nSecond, Good point, I can understand what the use scenario is, but do you mind providing more details like how to implement this in Spark? I guess this can be solved by providing a approximateValue API in Accumulator or SparkContext....\n\nThird, actually, this patch ensures that the value of the accumulator in a stage will only be available when this stage becomes independent (means that no job needs it any more, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/228/files#diff-6a9ff7fb74fd490a50462d45db2d5e11L400), if a job finishes, and the other job still needs the certain stage, the accumulator value calculated in that stage will not be counted...\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39641216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39641219","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/322#issuecomment-39641219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/322","id":39641219,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjQxMjE5","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-05T15:21:07Z","updated_at":"2014-04-05T15:21:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Let me know if there is any other change I need to make.

However in 2 of 3 cases, it ended up copying anyway (the call to `trim()`). The third case was in `Serializer.scala`, in `SerializerInstance.serializeMany`. But even there, I think the copying of the `byte[]` is offset by the fact that it can be merely `wrap()`ed by a `ByteBuffer` and avoids `ByteBuffer.allocate()` -- another copy in disguise. From my read, that was the potential difference, and I don't think there ends up being a meaningful difference.

I thought about this some more. I think that it might make more sense in the short term to just do what this is doing, revert to binding the UI to all interfaces.\n\nDoing a broader clean-up of the way we infer and bind to hostnames may not be in scope for 1.0 and I'd rather avoid the reversion here. So @kanzhang if you make the change @andrewor14 maybe we can just merge this. We'll need to document clearly that `SPARK_LOCAL_IP` is only used for internal communications (e.g. Akka actors) and that the UI binds to all interfaces at

@marmbrus - do you have strong attachments to scala logging? For the short term I do agree consolidating on Spark's existing logging would be nice. In particular, downstream consumers of Spark's logging subsystem do crazy stuff like routing to different sfl4j backends or inserting other log bridges and interceptors (e.g. http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/0-9-0-forces-log4j-usage-td532.html)\n\nAdding another logger into the mix seems like it could be risky. Or at least, it might be nice to merge this now and then separately decide if we want Spark's overall logging system to migrate to scalalogging.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39652335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/comments/39652413","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/308#issuecomment-39652413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/308","id":39652413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjUyNDEz","user":{"login":"mateiz","id":228859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz","html_url":"https://github.com/mateiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mateiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-05T22:16:53Z","updated_at":"2014-04-05T22:16:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Alright,
