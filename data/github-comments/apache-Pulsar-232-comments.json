I'm already working on it and will make a pull request then.\r\n\r\nOne question: After digging a little in the code and thinking about possible fixes I would rather like to drop the `withConfig` method from `PulsarStandaloneBuilder` and replace it with a `withConfigFile` method. I don't see any other way (without major changes), to apply configuration settings without unexpected overwriting and in an order a user would expect. A config file is required in any case and with a `withConfigFile` method the `PulsarStandaloneBuilder` is able to read it in it's `build` method like the `PulsarStandaloneStarter` constructor does, which would fix the second part of this issue. If a user wants to change some config settings by code, it's possible by modifying the `ServiceConfiguration` object of the created `PulsarStandalone` instance after calling `PulsarStandaloneBuilder.build()` and before calling `PulsarStandalone.start()` without the need to create an own `ServiceConfiguration` instance. This would also make clear to the user, that modifying the config object overwrites values set via configuration file (at least those not for the `LocalBookkeeperEnsemble`, but that's another story).\r\nDropping `PulsarStandaloneBuilder.withConfig` shouldn't be such a problem with existing code as currently it effectively does nothing. And it seems that no other user has noticed that. 8)\r\nIs this solution ok for you?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/656769281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/comments/656861153","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/7489#issuecomment-656861153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/issues/7489","id":656861153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Njg2MTE1Mw==","user":{"login":"devinbost","id":7418031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTgwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7418031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost","html_url":"https://github.com/devinbost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devinbost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-10T19:51:43Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T19:51:43Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@sijie I'm open to contributing a fix for this, but if it will change the end-user data contract, we'd need to vet it with the community.

This sounds like causing some zookeeper call didn't come back and the ledger recovery op stuck without triggering any callback which in return causes the problem in managed ledger library.\r\n\r\nA side note - I created an issue a while ago to separate loading cursors from loading managed ledger.

only downside for #7406 is it puts restriction for each IO thread that can makes user to create multiple connections to achieve higher throughput. and I believe this PR addresses both the issues and
