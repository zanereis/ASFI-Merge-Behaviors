Make sure your PR title starts with JIRA issue id, e.g., 'BIGTOP-3638: Your PR title ...'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of PR\r\n\r\nfix commons-configuration2 CVE\r\nHADOOP-19123. Update to commons-configuration2 2.10.1 due to CVE #6661\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/6661\r\n\r\nfix commons-compress CVE\r\nHADOOP-19114. Upgrade to commons-compress 1.26.1 due to CVEs. #6636\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/6636/files\r\n\r\nThis PR is to resolve the compilation failure issue caused by the modification of a CVE.\r\nHADOOP-18929. Exclude commons-compress module-info.class #6169\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/6169\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to solve the inconvenience of having to exclude dependencies every time a modification is made, such as after modifying the two CVEs above, by excluding all of them.\r\nHADOOP-18916. Exclude all module-info classes from uber jars (#6131) #6188\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/6188\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is divided into two patches. The reason why the two CVEs were combined into one patch is that the code merged for the two CVEs is only separated by one line (LicenseBinary). After applying the first patch, the second patch would report a conflict. The modifications for HADOOP-18929 were reverted in HADOOP-18916, which adopted a better implementation, hence HADOOP-18916 is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test ,smoke test\r\n\r\ntested on rocky8\r\n./docker-hadoop.sh -d -dcp --create 3 --image bigtop/puppet:trunk-rockylinux-8 --docker-compose-plugin --memory 8g --repo file:///bigtop-home/output --disable-gpg-check --stack hdfs,yarn,mapreduce --smoke-tests hdfs,yarn,mapreduce\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/757579f7-6ef8-43ae-9610-853208613b37)\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

Upon inspection, I found that the code logic for pkgSuffix and parent directory in RPMs shared similarities in several places and was repetitive. The DEB logic appeared similar too. Instead of following the previous practice that resulted in significant code duplication, I have refactored this part and conducted tests.\r\n\r\nBelow are some comments regarding the modifications added.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetPkgNameSuffix(component, type) {\r\n    def originalSuffix = type.equalsIgnoreCase(\"deb\") ? component.deb_pkg_suffix : component.rpm_pkg_suffix\r\n    \r\n#In RPMs, the Suffix is in the form of a macro and cannot be an empty string, as it would result in a \"macro empty body\" \r\nerror. However, in DEB packaging, an empty string can be used.\r\n\r\n    def defaultSuffix = type.equalsIgnoreCase(\"deb\") ?  \"\" : \"%{nil}\"\r\n    def pkgNameSuffix = project.hasProperty(\"pkgSuffix\")? originalSuffix : defaultSuffix\r\n    #The gradlePkgNameSuffix is solely used for concatenating package names, thus it must be empty if the originalSuffix does not exist.\r\n    def gradlePkgNameSuffix = pkgNameSuffix == defaultSuffix ? \"\" : pkgNameSuffix\r\n\r\n    return [pkgNameSuffix: pkgNameSuffix, gradlePkgNameSuffix: gradlePkgNameSuffix]\r\n}\r\ndef getParentDir(bigtopBaseVersion, type) {\r\n    #In RPMs, the Suffix is in the form of a macro and cannot be an empty string, as it would result in a \"macro empty body\" error. However, in DEB packaging, an empty string can be used.\r\n    def defaultParentDirValue = type.equalsIgnoreCase(\"deb\") ? \"\" : \"%{nil}\"\r\n    def parentDir = project.hasProperty(\"parentDir\") ? project.property('parentDir') : defaultParentDirValue\r\n    if (parentDir && parentDir != \"%{nil}\") {\r\n        parentDir = \"${parentDir}/${bigtopBaseVersion}\"\r\n    }\r\n    return parentDir\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test and smoke test\r\ntest without suffix\r\n. /etc/profile.d/bigtop.sh;./gradlew zookeeper-clean zookeeper-pkg  -PbuildThreads=2C repo \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/d58db023-ac9c-44b8-bce4-9565b7fd8eda)\r\n\r\nsmoke test\r\n./docker-hadoop.sh -d -dcp -C config_rockylinux-8.yaml -F docker-compose-cgroupv2.yml -G -L -k zookeeper -s zookeeper -c 1\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/1795cf62-a825-4472-a29b-2f99594a7bf5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntest with suffix \r\n. /etc/profile.d/bigtop.sh;./gradlew zookeeper-clean zookeeper-pkg -PparentDir=/usr/bigtop -PpkgSuffix -PbuildThreads=2C repo \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/34dc6750-2457-4288-9314-888715059bc6)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/307e126c-04d2-4c17-8544-64fe0b39c64c)\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

Due to cheelio's long absence of response and inactivity on this PR, it has been resubmitted in the hope of continuing to drive this matter forward. Based on the original PR, support for pkg suffix has been added, and the version has been updated to 2.0, along with some fixes for 2.0.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this effort lies in its ability to enhance Knox functionality, particularly in clusters employing Kerberos. Knox's proxy access capabilities provide an intuitive means for users to access the UI interface of Kerberos-enabled clusters.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nsmoke test and manual test\r\ntested on rocky8\r\n./docker-hadoop.sh -d --create 1 --image bigtop/puppet:trunk-rockylinux-8 --docker-compose-plugin --memory 8g --repo file:///bigtop-home/output --disable-gpg-check --stack knox --smoke-tests knox \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/d846aad0-9366-4a20-9a48-c719585f3982)\r\n\r\ntested on debian11\r\n./docker-hadoop.sh -d -dcp -C config_debian-11.yaml -F docker-compose.yml -G -L -k knox  -s knox -c 1 \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/a25743c8-eec7-46b2-90d0-f993629a9304)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/38788e5e-4731-44bf-a7bc-3ea321aa27ea)\r\n\r\n\r\ntested on ambari deploy \r\n. /etc/profile.d/bigtop.sh;./gradlew knox-clean knox-pkg -PparentDir=/usr/bigtop -PpkgSuffix -PbuildThreads=2C repo\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/1e7f94d2-4909-4b1c-b923-6f078b096231)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/3f042868-363a-4ec8-ad95-8355eff1cd01)\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

Make sure your PR title starts with JIRA issue id, e.g., 'BIGTOP-3638: Your PR title ...'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of PR\r\nIssue: ranegr 2.4 can be compiled successfully in Maven 3.6, but fails in Maven 3.8.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/4a0bcd7d-bd4b-4a9b-9249-e5cf13ae61a7)\r\n\r\nDue to improvements made in Maven versions after 3.6, the `kafka.version` setting can affect the versions of dependencies in the global JAR files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKylin-server-base ultimately depends on `org.apache.kafka`. When compiled in Maven 3.6, it resolves to `org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.11:2.1.1`. However, in Maven 3.8, it attempts to find `org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.11:2.8.2`, which does not exist in Maven repositories.\r\n\r\nMaven 3.8 introduces a new feature that rigorously handles dependency versions defined in the global POM file. Dependency versions defined in the global POM file take precedence over project-specific versions, potentially overriding explicitly specified versions. This stricter version propagation rule can lead to different dependency resolution behavior in Maven 3.8 compared to Maven 3.6.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in Maven 3.8, the `kafka.version` defined in the global POM affects the Kafka version in kylin-server-base, leading to compilation failure. Adding dependency management can resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/034641b5-f73f-48ad-b713-e8581d0b95cc)\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

Make sure your PR title starts with JIRA issue id, e.g., 'BIGTOP-3638: Your PR title ...'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of PR\r\nDue to incorrect dependency settings in the distro module, Ranger cannot utilize multicore concurrent compilation. As a result, compiling Ranger is very slow each time, as all modules can only be compiled serially.\r\nWith this patch, Ranger can be compiled in parallel, greatly speeding up the process. Compilation can now be completed in just a few minutes.\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP-4037\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/cfcc3806-34e7-4edd-b081-f71c04007657)\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.

Make sure your PR title starts with JIRA issue id, e.g., 'BIGTOP-3638: Your PR title ...'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of PR\r\nThe reason for the slow compilation: The Hadoop project has many modules, and the inability to compile them in parallel results in a slow process. For instance, the first compilation of Hadoop might take several hours, and even with local Maven dependencies, a subsequent compilation can still take close to 40 minutes, which is very slow.\r\n\r\nHow to solve it: Use mvn dependency:tree and maven-to-plantuml to investigate the dependency issues that prevent parallel compilation.\r\n\r\nInvestigate the dependencies between project modules.\r\nAnalyze the dependencies in multi-module Maven projects.\r\nDownload maven-to-plantuml:\r\n \r\nwget https://github.com/phxql/maven-to-plantuml/releases/download/v1.0/maven-to-plantuml-1.0.jar\r\n\r\nGenerate a dependency tree:\r\n \r\nmvn dependency:tree > dep.txt\r\n\r\nGenerate a UML diagram from the dependency tree:\r\n \r\njava -jar maven-to-plantuml.jar --input dep.txt --output dep.puml\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit: [maven-to-plantuml GitHub repository](https://github.com/phxql/maven-to-plantuml/tree/master).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHadoop Parallel Compilation Submission Logic\r\n\r\nReasons for Parallel Compilation Failure\r\nIn sequential compilation, as modules are compiled one by one in order, there are no errors because the compilation follows the module sequence.\r\nHowever, in parallel compilation, all modules are compiled simultaneously. The compilation order during multi-module concurrent compilation depends on the inter-module dependencies. If Module A depends on Module B, then Module B will be compiled before Module A. This ensures that the compilation order follows the dependencies between modules.\r\nBut when Hadoop compiles in parallel, for example, compiling hadoop-yarn-project, the dependencies between modules are correct. The issue arises during the dist package stage. dist packages all other compiled modules.\r\nBehavior of hadoop-yarn-project in Serial Compilation:\r\n\r\nIn serial compilation, it compiles modules in the pom one by one in sequence. After all modules are compiled, it compiles hadoop-yarn-project. During the prepare-package stage, the maven-assembly-plugin plugin is executed for packaging. All packages are repackaged according to the description in hadoop-assemblies/src/main/resources/assemblies/hadoop-yarn-dist.xml.\r\nBehavior of hadoop-yarn-project in Parallel Compilation:\r\nParallel compilation compiles modules according to the dependency order among them. If modules do not declare dependencies on each other through dependency, they are compiled in parallel. According to the dependency definition in the pom of hadoop-yarn-project, the dependencies are compiled first, followed by hadoop-yarn-project, executing its maven-assembly-plugin.\r\nHowever, the files needed for packaging in hadoop-assemblies/src/main/resources/assemblies/hadoop-yarn-dist.xml are not all included in the dependency of hadoop-yarn-project. Therefore, when compiling hadoop-yarn-project and executing maven-assembly-plugin, not all required modules are built yet, leading to errors in parallel compilation.\r\nSolution:\r\nThe solution is relatively straightforward: organize all modules from hadoop-assemblies/src/main/resources/assemblies/hadoop-yarn-dist.xml, and then declare them as dependencies in the pom of hadoop-yarn-project.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/bigtop/assets/18082602/ad07e665-272e-4172-994f-bc515c09f582)\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the title or this PR starts with the corresponding JIRA issue id (e.g. 'BIGTOP-3638.
