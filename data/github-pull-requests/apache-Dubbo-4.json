-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-02T13:41:45Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T08:46:11Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T08:46:11Z","merged_at":"2024-09-05T08:46:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"40e214c34c5bf94ed16f332b23b032efac17cb08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/58b3ba101285d17aa7ab6d17074cc6304bdd7392","head":{"label":"oxsean:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"58b3ba101285d17aa7ab6d17074cc6304bdd7392","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-02T10:39:01Z","updated_at":"2024-09-02T11:11:51Z","closed_at":"2024-09-02T11:11:51Z","merged_at":"2024-09-02T11:11:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"ee3855e2f42bfbc84acb3c9ef7c74202f9226273","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d7304aa27fc9dd21b138759623bc060538bd8cf0","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0902-cache","ref":"0902-cache","sha":"d7304aa27fc9dd21b138759623bc060538bd8cf0","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-31T16:15:30Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T13:36:55Z","closed_at":"2024-09-02T10:29:10Z","merged_at":"2024-09-02T10:29:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"51f4f7454e70c2acd31355763a5186f9d6f257f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14604/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14604/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14604/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/aac179d2b668ca497c37958b3e4dee799536cfba","head":{"label":"oxsean:perf-tuning","ref":"perf-tuning","sha":"aac179d2b668ca497c37958b3e4dee799536cfba","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-30T08:36:37Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T02:07:05Z","closed_at":"2024-09-09T01:59:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0347bdfe57ab262761d891f74be2b5720e767c37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/52e21ddcefc7654b3d82f1b2fba64f983c9c5ffa","head":{"label":"Chenjp:3.2-sonar-quality-enhance","ref":"3.2-sonar-quality-enhance","sha":"52e21ddcefc7654b3d82f1b2fba64f983c9c5ffa","user":{"login":"Chenjp","id":3371180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzExODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3371180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp","html_url":"https://github.com/Chenjp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":785001058,"node_id":"R_kgDOLsoqYg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Chenjp/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Chenjp","id":3371180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzExODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3371180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp","html_url":"https://github.com/Chenjp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Chenjp/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix #14559 \r\n\r\nCurator5 has a new feature about `EnsembleTracker`,  the `dubbo-registry-zookeeper` module introduces curator5 dependency default, but it still compatible with Curator4 because all the classes and  method are also exist in curator4 exclude the `ensembleTracker()` method so it works fine.\r\n\r\nIf we want to support the new feature about Curator5 and compatible with Curator4 together, it need to check the method exist to avoid occur the `NoSuchMethodError`.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nSupport disable Curator EnsembleTracker

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-23T14:40:51Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T14:48:30Z","closed_at":"2024-08-26T01:45:20Z","merged_at":"2024-08-26T01:45:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"8467329b9ea98f39b8f3c8462f1e6d735619a428","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7850a8cc65bfa8b6a7c62a37b51d59c78a2c2909","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/native_generric","ref":"fix/native_generric","sha":"7850a8cc65bfa8b6a7c62a37b51d59c78a2c2909","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-21T03:33:14Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T07:21:22Z","closed_at":"2024-08-21T07:21:21Z","merged_at":"2024-08-21T07:21:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"f90314ab334cf287bbe5c9eb8bf23a3673dac074","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14564/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14564/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14564/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4b96c1f1f8ecbfb8cc8b7b230d6e7e82f40e50d1","head":{"label":"oxsean:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"4b96c1f1f8ecbfb8cc8b7b230d6e7e82f40e50d1","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-20T15:36:05Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T02:22:42Z","closed_at":"2024-08-21T02:14:57Z","merged_at":"2024-08-21T02:14:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"32336dbd8a5fa717f76c5ddaaf74296bc1ae8c64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1ccb7f3190cb1d3d1a23f0215efb15f419eaf4ac","head":{"label":"xingcici:fix/http_status_to_grpc_status","ref":"fix/http_status_to_grpc_status","sha":"1ccb7f3190cb1d3d1a23f0215efb15f419eaf4ac","user":{"login":"xingcici","id":38656144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjU2MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38656144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici","html_url":"https://github.com/xingcici","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":845102087,"node_id":"R_kgDOMl88Bw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xingcici/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xingcici","id":38656144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjU2MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38656144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici","html_url":"https://github.com/xingcici","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xingcici/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xingcici/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

href=\"https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/releases\">com.alibaba.nacos:nacos-client's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>2.4.1 (Aug 15th, 2024)</h2>\n<p>该版本主要针对部分Jraft请求处理时，会造成任意文件读写的问题进行修复。</p>\n<p>该漏洞仅影响7848端口（默认设置下），一般使用时该端口为Nacos集群间Raft协议的通信端口，不承载客户端请求，因此老版本可以通过禁止该端口来自Nacos集群外的请求达到止血目的（如部署时已进行限制或未暴露，则风险可控）。</p>\n<p>另外该版本也在2.4.0的基础上针对derby ops接口做了进一步优化，默认限制derby数据库可执行的SQL范围，降低用户在打开derby ops接口后的风险。</p>\n<p>变更详情请查看下文：</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The version mainly fixes the issue of arbitrary file read and write that can occur during the processing of some Jraft requests.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability only affects port 7848 (by default), which is typically used as the communication port for Nacos cluster inter-raft protocol and does not handle client requests. Therefore, the risk can be controlled by disabling requests from outside of Nacos clusters (e.g. by limiting or not exposing the port) in older versions.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this version has further optimized the Derby Ops API by restricting the range of executable SQL commands on the Derby database by default, thereby reducing the risk to users when accessing the Derby Ops API.</p>\n<p>Please see the details of the changes below:</p>\n<h1>Change details</h1>\n<h2>Feature</h2>\n<h2>Enhancement&amp;Refactor</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11887\">#11887</a> Add some tips when <code>token.secret.key</code> is not base64.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12311\">#12311</a> Enhance console to support namespace list with selectors.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12405\">#12405</a> LDAP plugin support custom admin user password for default.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12446\">#12446</a> Enhance hint when got Mac Instance with error in default auth plugin.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12466\">#12466</a> Enhance to configurable service metadata and instance metadata length.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12477\">#12477</a> Enhance default auth plugin to support <code>auth_basic</code> when logout.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12489\">#12489</a> Remove KvStorage and ConsistencyService.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12490\">#12490</a> Enhance derby mode to support limit SQL Type.</p>\n<h2>BugFix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12301\">#12301</a> Fix headlth check for persistent instance for different namespace but groupName and serviceName are same.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12374\">#12374</a> Fix memory calculate error for metrics api.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12397\">#12397</a> Fix the bug of parsing empty connection control rule problem.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12410\">#12410</a> Fix no hint when beta config content is not equal with formal content.</p>\n<h2>Dependency</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12342\">#12342</a> Resolve the Hessian package conflict.</p>\n<h2>New Contributors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/eltociear\"><code>@​eltociear</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12392\">alibaba/nacos#12392</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Sitosoym\"><code>@​Sitosoym</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12324\">alibaba/nacos#12324</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cold-l\"><code>@​cold-l</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12434\">alibaba/nacos#12434</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KouShenhai\"><code>@​KouShenhai</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12386\">alibaba/nacos#12386</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chen10038\"><code>@​chen10038</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12310\">alibaba/nacos#12310</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LHyphen\"><code>@​LHyphen</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12442\">alibaba/nacos#12442</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kangzhaok\"><code>@​kangzhaok</code></a> made their first contribution in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/12401\">alibaba/nacos#12401</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-14T06:21:20Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T07:14:18Z","closed_at":"2024-08-14T07:14:18Z","merged_at":"2024-08-14T07:14:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"a980cbd6b562ebeb4a3f7496f363150299aec8da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14537/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14537/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14537/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b47b34fe3358e74c5fd652e3ec2a0618de34bffa","head":{"label":"oxsean:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"b47b34fe3358e74c5fd652e3ec2a0618de34bffa","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-14T05:37:13Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T08:10:16Z","closed_at":"2024-08-16T08:10:16Z","merged_at":"2024-08-16T08:10:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"85282cdaca344a2262b73aa68c37a3255217e64c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6c20645c009bac060c37b9603cab4d215e087bfe","head":{"label":"funky-eyes:0813","ref":"0813","sha":"6c20645c009bac060c37b9603cab4d215e087bfe","user":{"login":"funky-eyes","id":19943636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQzNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19943636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes","html_url":"https://github.com/funky-eyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378361114,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgzNjExMTQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"funky-eyes/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"funky-eyes","id":19943636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQzNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19943636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes","html_url":"https://github.com/funky-eyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/funky-eyes/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this change is to improve the numeric validation logic in the timeout configuration code. This is achieved by replacing the previous isNotEmpty check with isNumeric and trim, ensuring that only valid numeric values are parsed, which enhances the robustness and readability of the code while reducing the risk of NumberFormatException.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- Replaced isNotEmpty check with isNumeric and trim to validate numeric input more accurately.\r\n- Optimized the try-catch logic to improve code readability and error handling efficiency.\r\n- Enhanced input validation for timeout configuration to ensure only valid numeric values are parsed.\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change can be verified by running the existing unit tests that cover timeout configuration scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-13T10:53:40Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T13:24:19Z","closed_at":"2024-08-13T13:24:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea219223950596b7f07a4a32446980d11db85b03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14532/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14532/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14532/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e721025e3210fb8ebc58af0a8eeda4ef6a5aa9bd","head":{"label":"jieyangxchen:refactor/validate-numeric-timeout","ref":"refactor/validate-numeric-timeout","sha":"e721025e3210fb8ebc58af0a8eeda4ef6a5aa9bd","user":{"login":"jieyangxchen","id":37837512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODM3NTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37837512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen","html_url":"https://github.com/jieyangxchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":841919166,"node_id":"R_kgDOMi6qvg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"jieyangxchen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jieyangxchen","id":37837512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODM3NTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37837512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen","html_url":"https://github.com/jieyangxchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jieyangxchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jieyangxchen/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-13T03:28:44Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T13:36:45Z","closed_at":"2024-08-20T10:04:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e80d126a1da5da6a49bdaf17cf79a9158bb3865e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d5189f8b809d83beacac8d454111fe8c75c63863","head":{"label":"oxsean:fluet-log-test","ref":"fluet-log-test","sha":"d5189f8b809d83beacac8d454111fe8c75c63863","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-12T06:43:35Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T01:54:32Z","closed_at":"2024-08-26T01:54:32Z","merged_at":"2024-08-26T01:54:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"9600dc9ce67121579bb4680a5121e674791c2858","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/097d58a05d90db53a42ef167eeacd4519c626f30","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.3-remove-triple-parameter","ref":"3.3-remove-triple-parameter","sha":"097d58a05d90db53a42ef167eeacd4519c626f30","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-12T03:39:07Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T06:47:02Z","closed_at":"2024-08-12T06:47:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0fe1129454193842b6fb5ad7b1e7c59a598e20a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/266f092742c1b256e037a31e839a68ab1e7b31d2","head":{"label":"blueuuufish:3.3-beta-sslsupport","ref":"3.3-beta-sslsupport","sha":"266f092742c1b256e037a31e839a68ab1e7b31d2","user":{"login":"blueuuufish","id":123882636,"node_id":"U_kgDOB2JMjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123882636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish","html_url":"https://github.com/blueuuufish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":841227655,"node_id":"R_kgDOMiQdhw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"blueuuufish/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"blueuuufish","id":123882636,"node_id":"U_kgDOB2JMjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123882636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish","html_url":"https://github.com/blueuuufish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blueuuufish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/blueuuufish/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-11T08:34:37Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T13:36:37Z","closed_at":"2024-09-04T02:38:13Z","merged_at":"2024-09-04T02:38:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8aeba3fbd3074fd19758096a6939ab6b824da13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/891a12ccd44bd026a97138cf09e6368375870218","head":{"label":"oxsean:refine-exception-process","ref":"refine-exception-process","sha":"891a12ccd44bd026a97138cf09e6368375870218","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-09T15:40:44Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T12:48:09Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T09:14:17Z","merged_at":"2024-09-06T09:14:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a4d756fe98a850ab8f9e3fc9240734fe40c9037","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/27dd643ac791f27f7b640e34c8804199eb2f994c","head":{"label":"oxsean:jsonutil-customize","ref":"jsonutil-customize","sha":"27dd643ac791f27f7b640e34c8804199eb2f994c","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-02T08:36:13Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T09:23:57Z","closed_at":"2024-08-02T08:39:07Z","merged_at":"2024-08-02T08:39:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c2be02570528b56857f6900927e73fcdcefb94c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14493/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14493/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14493/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fcdbae64e008d83077e4e8a0c40111b004137ecc","head":{"label":"oxsean:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"fcdbae64e008d83077e4e8a0c40111b004137ecc","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

client.\r\n\r\n#14353\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-02T01:21:56Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T13:36:33Z","closed_at":"2024-08-21T09:40:11Z","merged_at":"2024-08-21T09:40:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"3beeebe2cf709fcaade0a51d915dd4392efda462","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ee037a67780aba06bd4c8757e3ef0bce73deba7e","head":{"label":"oxsean:h3-protocol-negotiation","ref":"h3-protocol-negotiation","sha":"ee037a67780aba06bd4c8757e3ef0bce73deba7e","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-01T07:21:06Z","updated_at":"2024-08-01T15:36:15Z","closed_at":"2024-08-01T15:36:15Z","merged_at":"2024-08-01T15:36:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"4cc187886945989677d520004a8530b49fed8940","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14487/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14487/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14487/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bc9e059d1469126ba31e2d135c4d2a60066935c8","head":{"label":"saicaca:3.3-dev-xds","ref":"3.3-dev-xds","sha":"bc9e059d1469126ba31e2d135c4d2a60066935c8","user":{"login":"saicaca","id":25200299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjAwMjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25200299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca","html_url":"https://github.com/saicaca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":836556072,"node_id":"R_kgDOMdzVKA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"saicaca/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"saicaca","id":25200299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjAwMjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25200299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca","html_url":"https://github.com/saicaca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saicaca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/saicaca/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-31T15:48:08Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T13:36:43Z","closed_at":"2024-08-20T10:02:33Z","merged_at":"2024-08-20T10:02:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"737ff1dcdaf5f4a64151985954fce4ad2ec60581","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14484/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14484/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14484/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8ffc6cc1e6822b67a2d6f009ac2fa70677121ff8","head":{"label":"oxsean:fluet-log","ref":"fluet-log","sha":"8ffc6cc1e6822b67a2d6f009ac2fa70677121ff8","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
