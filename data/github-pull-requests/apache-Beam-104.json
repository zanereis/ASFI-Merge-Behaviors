Takes a jar path from the GetBeamJar() function and attempts to start up the service. Also adds unit testing for the functionality, sanity-checking behavior. Full functionality will be tested in an integration test (to be added later) as actually downloading and spinning up JARs has an external dependency on Maven.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Also, interestingly, on AWS SDK v1 the client correctly truncates the data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this reduces the memory footprint and improves performance of the S3 byte channel by avoiding reading the source buffer into an intermediate temporary array before writing to the upload buffer. If the underlying source buffer array is accessible, it is used for the optimal performance. Otherwise the implementation uses a safe alternative based on a read only copy buffer.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR re-exports the `metrics` subpackage in `apache_beam/__init__.py`. This has no effect at runtime, but it has two important consequences for Python SDK users\r\n\r\n* It is now legal to define metrics via `beam.metrics.Metrics`\r\n* Static analysis tools (type checkers, linters, IDEs) would be able to understand what `beam.metrics` refers to, and could thus offer checks, refactorings, completions etc.\r\n\r\nNo change is expected for existing Python SDK users.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master branch)\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>Lang</th>\r\n

PR addresses the outstanding support for relevant fields of a SNS `PublishResponse` using `SnsIO.Write` on AWS SDK v2. This is critical in order to check the HTTP status for errors since the current implementation only encodes the messageId field.\r\n\r\nSupport for SDK v1 was added in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9758. This PR simply ports those changes to SDK v2 to eventually reach feature parity.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

IOs for AWS SDK v1 already have support for STS assume role credentials. This adds similar support for AWS SDK v2.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's critical to note that support is limited. \r\n\r\n- After deserialization the `StsAssumeRoleCredentialsProvider` will always use the default STS client, regardless of what client was configured. The same limitation applies to the current support for AWS SDK v1.\r\n\r\n- Also, the `StsAssumeRoleCredentialsProvider` may be configured to provide a `AssumeRoleRequest` on demand through a `Supplier` function. After deserialization the `StsAssumeRoleCredentialsProvider` will always use the `AssumeRoleRequest` that was provided during serialization.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
