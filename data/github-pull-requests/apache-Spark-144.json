The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd two monitoring REST API endpoints under SQL that provides details about the structured streaming queries. Even though a store exists for it and the data is presented in the UI under the \"Structured Streaming\" tab, this data is not exposed as a REST API. \r\n\r\n#### Summary API\r\nReturns the summary of all existing streaming queries.\r\n\r\nGET `/{appId}/sql/streamingqueries`\r\n\r\nResponse is list of `StreamingQueryData`.\r\n\r\n#### Progress API\r\nReturns the progress events of a specific streaming query by `runId`. User can also specify how many of the most recent events needs to be retrieved by using the `last `query parameter. By default, we return the most recent progress event i.e. last is set to 1.\r\n\r\nGET `/{appId}/sql/streamingqueries/{runId}/progress?last={N}`\r\n\r\nResponse is list of `StreamingQueryProgress`.\r\n\r\nNote: We are not introducing new object definitions for the response since we are just returning the data from the store without aggregation, these are existing event structures - `StreamingQueryData` and `StreamingQueryProgress`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis data can be used for monitoring, detecting streaming and to build custom dashboards. This monitoring API will be similar to the monitoring APIs that are present for DStreams - refer [SPARK-18470](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18470).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Added 4 tests under `SqlResourceWithActualMetricsSuite` to test the endpoints when streaming code is executed. Tested various cases, parameters, boundary conditions\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298735/154372194-20945ddd-14ab-4ac5-894c-bc21f1c0aae4.png)\r\n\r\n* Added 2 tests under

the store, there is no need to test them individually.","created_at":"2022-02-16T23:05:08Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T00:18:15Z","closed_at":"2022-02-16T23:59:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8f77f3b448fc3e85df07c9194be5f1d3006e12a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to apply strict nullability of nested column in window struct for both time window and session window, which respects the dataType of TimeWindow and SessionWindow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe implementation of rule TimeWindowing and SessionWindowing have been exposed the possible risks of inconsistency between the dataType of TimeWindow/SessionWindow and the replacement. For the replacement, it is possible that analyzer/optimizer may decide the value expressions to be non-nullable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests added.","created_at":"2022-02-16T11:54:13Z","updated_at":"2022-02-21T05:48:09Z","closed_at":"2022-02-21T05:45:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"516392458ef7b9748a97bedc7c45e59df46b32d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35543/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35543/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35543/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5fe04f4e839229736930df12acc487c69222f845","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-38227","ref":"SPARK-38227","sha":"5fe04f4e839229736930df12acc487c69222f845","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

group-by expressions, attribute _groupingexpression#24 is missing from the child `ProjectExec`'s output.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the way `PullOutGroupingExpressions`, when determining which grouping expressions to shift from the `Aggregate` node to a `Project` node,  populates `complexGroupingExpressionMap`. `PullOutGroupingExpressions` uses a map operation to iterate over `groupingExpressions` and updates `complexGroupingExpressionMap` in the closure passed to `map()`. However, if `groupingExpressions` is a `Stream`, the map operation is evaluated lazily, and isn't fully completed until `ComputeCurrentTime` calls `transformAllExpressionsWithPruning`, which is long after `PullOutGroupingExpressions` completes. Therefore, at the time `PullOutGroupingExpressions` is ready to create the `Project` node, `complexGroupingExpressionMap` is not fully populated. As result, the `Project` node is missing all but the first complex grouping expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, other than the above query now works.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, SQL public Rest API does not expose `node description` and it is useful to have more details at query level such as:\r\n```\r\n- Join Operators(BHJ, SMJ, SHJ) => when correlating join operator with join type and which leg is built for BHJ. \r\n- HashAggregate => aggregated keys and agg functions\r\n- Providing alignment with SparkUI DAG visualization (per node/operator) under sql page (nodeDesc is shown \r\n   when user comes on the operator on UI)\r\n- List can be extended for other operators.\r\n```\r\nCurrent Sample Json Result:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"nodeId\" : 14,\r\n    \"nodeName\" : \"BroadcastHashJoin\",\r\n    \"wholeStageCodegenId\" : 3,\r\n    \"metrics\" : [ {\r\n          \"name\" : \"number of output

Result:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"nodeId\" : 14,\r\n    \"nodeName\" : \"BroadcastHashJoin\",\r\n    \"nodeDesc\" : \"BroadcastHashJoin [id#4], [id#24], Inner, BuildLeft, false\",\r\n    \"wholeStageCodegenId\" : 3,\r\n    \"metrics\" : [ {\r\n          \"name\" : \"number of output rows\",\r\n          \"value\" : {\r\n        \"amount\" : \"2\"\r\n          }\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n...\r\n{\r\n    \"nodeId\" : 8,\r\n    \"nodeName\" : \"HashAggregate\",\r\n    \"nodeDesc\" : \"HashAggregate(keys=[name#5, age#6, salary#18], functions=[avg(cast(age#6 as bigint)), avg(salary#18)])\",\r\n    \"wholeStageCodegenId\" : 4,\r\n    \"metrics\" : [ {\r\n      \"name\" : \"spill size\",\r\n      \"value\" : {\r\n        \"amount\" : \"0.0\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}

patch tested?\r\nAdd more coverage to existing

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR improves `RuntimeReplaceable` so that it can\r\n1. Customize the type coercion behavior instead of always inheriting from the replacement expression. This is useful for expressions like `ToBinary`, where its replacement expression can be `Cast` that does not have type coercion.\r\n2. Support aggregate functions.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a guideline for adding new SQL functions, with `RuntimeReplaceable` and `ExpressionBuilder`. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35534/files#diff-6c6ba3e220b9d155160e4e25305fdd3a4835b7ce9eba230a7ae70bdd97047313R330\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince we are keep adding new functions, it's better to make `RuntimeReplaceable` more useful and set up a standard for adding functions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nImproves error messages of some functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdjust input `format` of function `to_binary`:\r\n- gracefully fail for the non-string `format` parameter\r\n- remove arguable `base2` format support\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, function to_binary doesn't deal with the non-string `format` parameter properly.\r\nFor example, `spark.sql(\"select to_binary('abc', 1)\")` raises casting error, rather than hint that encoding format is unsupported. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the current result of the `base2` format is incorrect compared to other DBMSes: ours use `Cast(expr, BinaryType)` which utilizes `utf-8` format, whereas DBMSes (e.g. BigQuery)' convert a BASE2-encoded string to bytes.\r\n\r\nSo we remove the `base2` support now and will follow up with that later.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n- Better error messages for non-string `format` parameter. For example:\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select to_binary('abc', 1)\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: class java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String (java.lang.Integer is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap'; org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String is in unnamed module of loader 'app'); line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select to_binary('abc', 1)\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve 'to_binary('abc', 1)' due to data type mismatch: Unsupported encoding format: Some(1).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34936 support ANSI Aggregation Function: `percentile_cont`.\r\n**Syntax：**\r\n`PERCENTILE_CONT( <percentile> ) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY <order_by_expr>) OVER ( [ PARTITION BY <expr3> ] )`\r\n**Arguments：**\r\npercentile：The percentile of the value that you want to find. The percentile must be a constant between 0.0 and 1.0. For example, if you want to find the value at the 90th percentile, specify 0.9.\r\n\r\norder_by_expr：The expression (typically a column name) by which to order the values. \r\n\r\nexpr3：This is the optional expression used to group rows into partitions.\r\n\r\n**Examples**：\r\n```\r\nselect k, percentile_cont(0.25) within group (order by v) \r\n  from aggr \r\n  group by k\r\n  order by k;\r\n+---+-------------------------------------------------+\r\n| K | PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY V) |\r\n|---+-------------------------------------------------|\r\n| 0 |                                        10.00000 |\r\n| 1 |                                        12.50000 |\r\n| 2 |                                        17.50000 |\r\n| 3 |                                        60.00000 |\r\n| 4 |                                            NULL |\r\n+---+-------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note: specify order by or frame for window frame of `percentile_cont` is not allowed.**\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve migration from other systems to Spark SQL.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35419#discussion_r801354342, to add unit test to harden the assumption of SS partitioning and distribution requirement:\r\n* Check the `HashPartitioning.partitionIdExpression` to be exactly expected format\r\n* Check all different kinds of `Partitioning` against `StatefulOpClusteredDistribution`.\r\n\r\nAlso add a minor comment for `StatefulOpClusteredDistribution`, as `SinglePartition` can also satisfy the distribution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDocument our assumption of SS in code as unit test.\r\nSo next time when we introduce intrusive code change, the unit test can save us by failing loudly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe added unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn Hive the schema and partition columns must be disjoint sets, if hive table which all columns are partitioned columns, so that other columns is empty, it will fail when Hive create table, error msg as follow:\r\n\r\n`\r\nthrow new HiveException(\r\n\"at least one column must be specified for the table\")\r\n`\r\nThat's because we did the disjoint operation in `toHiveTable`\r\n\r\nSo when creating a Hive table, fail early if all the columns are partitioned columns, \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nunify analysis error msg when create table with all the columns are partitioned columns\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes, but error msg only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAt present, the sliding window adopts the form of expand + filter, but in some cases, filter is not necessary.\r\n\r\nFiltering is required if the sliding window is irregular. When the window length is divided by the slide length the result is an integer (I believe this is also the case for most work scenarios in practice for sliding window), there is no need to filter, which can save calculation resources and improve performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

This change proposes to remove states which are expired on watermark. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently streaming `dropDuplicates` simply stores all states forever if no watermark-attached key exists.\r\n\r\nFor streaming stateful operator, this seems counterintuitive behavior if we consider other stateful operations such as streaming joining.\r\n\r\nIt also means the number of state will grow up infinitely as we observe in real application. But it doesn't make sense to add a time column into dedup keys because we don't really deduplicate rows by [key, time] but only by [key].\r\n\r\nMore reasonable streaming dedup seems to remove out-of-watermark states if the input data (not key) has watermark. Note that, unfortunately, this will be a behavior change, for streaming queries with dedup operation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. The state value format will be changed for streaming dedup. This is also a behavior change for streaming dedup.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.","created_at":"2022-02-15T06:17:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:26:27Z","closed_at":"2022-03-01T07:36:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef9ce395fac8b135ce149f1bee5b39f70a397dc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

needed?\r\nAfter [SPARK-24586](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24586), loose upcasting from string to other types are not allowed by default. User can still set `spark.sql.legacy.looseUpcast=true` to restore old behavior but it's not documented.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35410 to fix a mistake. `HiveContext` should set `spark.sql.catalogImplementation` to `hive` instead of `in-memory`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes several changes:\r\n- Make `HiveContext.getOrCreate` works identically as `SQLContext.getOrCreate`\r\n- Match the signature of `HiveContext.__init__` and `SQLContext.__init__` (both are not supported to be directly called by users though).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35410#discussion_r806358814\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo to end users because this change has not been released out yet.\r\n\r\nIt creates a non-Hive supported `SparkSession` if there isn't an existing SparkSession running. See also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35410#discussion_r806358814.\r\n\r\nNobody uses `HiveContext` directly anymore but it's better to keep the behaviours unchanged.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested (in PySpark shell):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.stop()\r\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import HiveContext\r\nHiveContext.getOrCreate(SparkContext.getOrCreate()).getConf(\"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```pyspark\r\n'in-memory'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```pyspark\r\n'hive'\r\n```","created_at":"2022-02-15T01:22:32Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:50:45Z","closed_at":"2022-02-15T17:27:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dcfec48c7e15735fbfd3ce5372966565890980ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/acb33f535807859351a9bc644a28ff5384273922","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-38121-followup","ref":"SPARK-38121-followup","sha":"acb33f535807859351a9bc644a28ff5384273922","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`QueryExecution.debug#toFile` method supports passing in `maxFields` and this parameter will be passed down when `explainMode` is `SimpleMode`, `ExtendedMode`, or `CostMode`.   \r\n\r\nBut the passed down `maxFields` was ignored when `explainMode` is `CostMode` because `QueryExecution#stringWithStats` overrides it with `SQLConf.get.maxToStringFields` at present,  so this pr removes the override behavior to let passed in `maxFields` take effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA and add a new test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe code of method: populateStartOffsets in class: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.MicroBatchExecution is modified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn some unexpected cases, commit and offset are inconsistent, and offset is not written into HDFS continuously, as follows:\r\n\r\n        commits\r\n        /tmp/streaming_xxxxxxxx/commits/113256\r\n        /tmp/streaming_xxxxxxxx/commits/113257\r\n\r\n        offsets\r\n        /tmp/streaming_xxxxxxxx/offsets/113257\r\n        /tmp/streaming_xxxxxxxx/offsets/113259\r\nWhen we start the streaming program, batch ${latestBatchId - 1} is 113258, but offsets 113258 doesn't exist, an exception will be thrown, resulting in the program cannot be started. As an improvement, Spark doesn‘t need to repair itself, but we could probably do some simply analysis and give better error message.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nAn error message is logged if the exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nI have provided a test case that can output logs correctly.\r\nWe can run test(\"SPARK-38033: SS cannot be....\") in the MicroBatchExecutionSuite class. In fact, I simulated a corresponding scenario to test the original exception.This exception validates normally and outputs a new error message, as follows:\r\n\r\n    11:00:26.271 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.ResolveWriteToStream: spark.sql.adaptive.enabled is not supported in streaming DataFrames/Datasets and will be disabled.\r\n    11:00:26.675 ERROR org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.MicroBatchExecution: The offset log for batch 3 doesn't exist, which is required to restart the query from the latest batch 4 from the offset log.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add the context of current challenge on fixing distribution of stateful operator, even the distribution is a sort of \"broken\" now.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the review comment https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35419#discussion_r801343068\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-38124 we figured out the existing long-standing problem in stateful operator, but it is not easy to fix since the fix may break the existing query if the fix is not carefully designed. Anyone should also be pretty much careful when touching the required distribution. We want to document this explicitly to help others to be careful whenever someone is around the codebase.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCode comment only changes.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-14T10:52:42Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T02:47:50Z","closed_at":"2022-02-15T02:47:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f7f4fcd4b5f28a3f76298ee4aca01ac080b839c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change is to ignore failures in jar download when updating jar dependencies in Executor.run().\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently when a user adds a jar with an invalid URL into SparkContext, all subsequent query executions will fail when trying to download that jar, even when the query has nothing to do with the jar dependency. This change is to fix that by ignoring the failure when downloading the jar.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`QueryExecution.debug#toFile` method supports passing in `maxFields` and this parameter will be passed down when `explainMode` is `SimpleMode`, `ExtendedMode`, or `CostMode`.   \r\n\r\nBut the passed down `maxFields` was ignored when `explainMode` is `CostMode` because `QueryExecution#stringWithStats` overrides it with `SQLConf.get.maxToStringFields` at present,  so this pr removes the override behavior to let passed in `maxFields` take effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA and add a new test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new config to set the memory overhead factor for drivers and executors. Currently the memory overhead is hard coded to 10% (except in Kubernetes), and the only way to set it higher is to set it to a specific memory amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn dynamic environments where different people or use cases need different memory requirements, it would be helpful to set a higher memory overhead factor instead of having to set a higher specific memory overhead value.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new function `TIMESTAMPADD` with the following parameters:\r\n1. `unit` - specifies an unit of interval. It can be a string or an identifier. Supported the following values (case-insensitive):\r\n   - YEAR\r\n   - QUARTER\r\n   - MONTH\r\n   - WEEK\r\n   - DAY, DAYOFYEAR\r\n   - HOUR\r\n   - MINUTE\r\n   - SECOND\r\n   - MILLISECOND\r\n   - MICROSECOND\r\n2. `quantity` - the amount of `unit`s to add. It has the `INT` type. It can be positive or negative.\r\n3. `timestamp` - a timestamp (w/ or w/o timezone) to which you want to add.\r\n\r\nThe function returns the original timestamp plus the given interval. The result has the same type as the input `timestamp` (for `timestamp_ntz`, it returns `timestamp_ntz` and for `timestamp_ltz` -> `timestamp_ltz`).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val df = sql(\"select timestampadd(YEAR, 1, timestamp_ltz'2022-02-16 01:02:03') as ts1, timestampadd(YEAR, 1, timestamp_ntz'2022-02-16 01:02:03') as ts2\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [ts1: timestamp, ts2: timestamp_ntz]\r\n\r\nscala> df.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- ts1: timestamp (nullable = false)\r\n |-- ts2: timestamp_ntz (nullable = false)\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> df.show(false)\r\n+-------------------+-------------------+\r\n|ts1                |ts2                |\r\n+-------------------+-------------------+\r\n|2023-02-16 01:02:03|2023-02-16 01:02:03|\r\n+-------------------+-------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** if the `timestamp` has the type `timestamp_ltz`, and `unit` is:\r\n- YEAR, QUARTER, MONTH - the input timestamp is converted to a local timestamp at the session time (see `spark.sql.session.timeZone`). And after that, the function adds the amount of months to the local timestamp, and converts the result to a `timestamp_ltz` at the same session time zone.\r\n- `WEEK`, `DAY` - in similar way as above, the function adds the total amount of days to the timestamp at the session time zone.\r\n- `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND`, `MILLISECOND`, `MICROSECOND` - the functions converts the interval to the total amount of microseconds, and adds them to the given timestamp (expressed as an offset from the epoch).\r\n\r\nFor example, Sun 13-Mar-2022 at 02:00:00 A.M. is a daylight saving time in the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.session.timeZone=America/Los_Angeles;\r\nspark.sql.session.timeZone\tAmerica/Los_Angeles\r\nspark-sql> select timestampadd(HOUR, 4, timestamp_ltz'2022-03-13 00:00:00'), timestampadd(HOUR, 4, timestamp_ntz'2022-03-13 00:00:00');\r\n2022-03-13 05:00:00\t2022-03-13 04:00:00\r\nspark-sql> select timestampadd(DAY, 1, timestamp_ltz'2022-03-13 00:00:00'), timestampadd(DAY, 1, timestamp_ntz'2022-03-13 00:00:00');\r\n2022-03-14 00:00:00\t2022-03-14 00:00:00\r\nspark-sql> select timestampadd(Month, -1, timestamp_ltz'2022-03-13 00:00:00'), timestampadd(month, -1, timestamp_ntz'2022-03-13 00:00:00');\r\n2022-02-13 00:00:00\t2022-02-13 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nIn fact, such behavior is similar to adding an ANSI interval to a timestamp.\r\n\r\nThe function also supports implicit conversion of the input date to a timestamp according the general rules of Spark SQL. By default, Spark SQL converts dates to timestamp (which is timestamp_ltz by default).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To make the migration process from other systems to Spark SQL easier.\r\n2. To achieve feature parity with other DBMSs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This is new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DateTimeUtilsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport write container stdout/stderr to file\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf users want to sidecar logging agent to send stdout/stderr to external log storage,  only way is to change entrypoint.sh, which might break compatibility with community version.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd check for total executor cores when `SetReaderPartitions` message received.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn continuous processing mode, EpochCoordinator won't add offsets to query until got ReportPartitionOffset from all partitions. Normally, each kafka topic partition will be handled by one core, if total cores is smaller than total kafka topic partition counts, the job will hang without any error message.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if total executor cores is smaller than total kafka partition count, the exception with below error will be thrown:\r\n`Total %s (kafka partitions) * %s (cpus per task) = %s needed, \r\nbut only have %s (executors) * %s (cores per executor) = %s (total cores).\r\nPlease increase total number of executor cores to at least %s.`\r\n\r\n### How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch added volcano feature step to help user integrate spark with Volcano Scheduler.\r\n- Add a VolcanoFeatureStep, it can be used in driver and executor side.\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, users can enable this featurestep by submiting job by using\r\n```shell\r\n--conf spark.kubernete.driver.scheduler.name=volcano \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.featureSteps=org.apache.spark.deploy.k8s.features.scheduler.VolcanoFeatureStep\r\n```\r\n\r\nA PodGroup will be created before driver started, annotations will be set to driver pod to added driver pod to this pod group. Then, Volcano scheduler will help driver pod scheduling instead of deafult kubernetes scheduler.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR help user integrate Spark with Volcano Scheduler.\r\n\r\nSee also: [SPARK-36057](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36057)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, introduced a user feature step.\r\n\r\nThese are used by `VolcanoFeatureStep`, and also will be used by `YunikornFeatureStep` in future.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- UT\r\n- Integration test: Test all VolcanoSuite (all kubernetes test with volcano + a new podgroup test) and KubernetesSuite\r\n```bash\r\n# Deploy Volcano (x86)\r\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volcano-sh/volcano/master/installer/volcano-development.yaml\r\n# Deploy Volcano (arm64)\r\nkubectl apply -f

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35248 provides a new framework to represent catalyst expressions in DS V2 APIs.\r\nBecause the framework translate all catalyst expressions to a unified SQL string and cannot keep compatibility between different JDBC database, the framework works not good.\r\n\r\nThis PR reactor the framework so as JDBC dialect could compile expression by self way.\r\nFirst, The framework translate catalyst expressions to DS V2 expression.\r\nSecond, The JDBC dialect could compile DS V2 expression to different SQL syntax.\r\n\r\nThe java doc looks show below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/156579584-f56cafb5-641f-4c5b-a06e-38f4369051c3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake  the framework be more common use.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nThe feature is not released.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to show warning message when creating pandas-on-Spark session under ANSI mode.\r\n\r\nThe message will be shown looks like the below:\r\n```python\r\n>>> ps.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'])\r\n.../spark/python/pyspark/pandas/utils.py:969: PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning: The config 'spark.sql.ansi.enabled' is set to True. This can cause the unexpected behavior from pandas API on Spark since pandas API on Spark follows the behavior of pandas, not SQL.\r\n  warnings.warn(message, PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince pandas API on Spark follows the behavior of pandas, not SQL.\r\n\r\nSo the unexpected behavior can be occurred when the ANSI mode is on (when \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" is True).\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n- It raises exception when `div` & `mod` related methods returns null (e.g. `DataFrame.rmod`)\r\n```python\r\n>>> df\r\n   angels  degress\r\n0       0      360\r\n1       3      180\r\n2       4      360\r\n>>> df.rmod(2)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\n: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 32.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 32.0 (TID 165) (172.30.1.44 executor driver): org.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: divide by zero. To return NULL instead, use 'try_divide'. If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.enabled to false (except for ANSI interval type) to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- It raises exception when DataFrame for `ps.melt` has not the same column type.\r\n```python\r\n>>> df\r\n   A  B  C\r\n0  a  1  2\r\n1  b  3  4\r\n2  c  5  6\r\n>>> ps.melt(df)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: cannot resolve 'array(struct('A', A), struct('B', B), struct('C', C))' due to data type mismatch: input to function array should all be the same type, but it's [struct<variable:string,value:string>, struct<variable:string,value:bigint>, struct<variable:string,value:bigint>]\r\nTo fix the error, you might need to add explicit type casts.

If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.strictIndexOperator to false to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot only for the example cases, if the internal SQL function used to implement the function has different behavior according to ANSI options, an unexpected error may occur.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis will show warning message as mentioned above, when the session for pandas API on Spark is initialized if \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" is set as True.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing tests should be

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR relaxes the constraint added in [SPARK-35080](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35080) by allowing safe up-cast expressions in correlated equality predicates.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCast expressions are often added by the compiler during query analysis. Correlated equality predicates can be less restrictive to support this common pattern if a cast expression guarantees one-to-one mapping between the child expression and the output datatype (safe up-cast).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Safe up-cast expressions are allowed in correlated equality predicates:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT (SELECT SUM(b) FROM VALUES (1, 1), (1, 2) t(a, b) WHERE CAST(a AS STRING) = x)\r\nFROM VALUES ('1'), ('2') t(x)\r\n```\r\nBefore this change, this query will throw AnalysisException \"Correlated column is not allowed in predicate...\", and after this change, this query can run successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis changes `WritableColumnVector` to better support null structs, by avoiding allocating space in child vectors when an element is null.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, for a `WritableColumnVector` whose type is struct, Spark needs to allocate space in all child vectors even if an element is null. This is not very space efficient. \r\n\r\nIn addition, this doesn't work well with the ongoing Parquet vectorized support for complex types, since when creating the child column vectors for a struct, we don't yet have the information of which slot is for null struct (Parquet packs values contiguously instead of having null slots).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nShouldn't be, since `WritableColumnVector` is Spark internal API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated `ColumnVectorSuite` and `ColumnarBatchSuite` to reflect the new

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCorrect the logic to measure the memory usage of RocksDB to include the memory used by block cache.\r\nAs \"block-cache-pinned-usage\" is included in \"block-cache-usage\", we don't need to sum the pinned usage separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrent reported metrics of RocksDB memory usage is not correct.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- `EliminateDistinct`: change `transformExpressions` to `transformAllExpressionsWithPruning `\r\n- `EliminateAggregateFilter `: change `transformExpressionsWithPruning` to `transformAllExpressionsWithPruning`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`transformExpressions` can only traverse all expressions in this current query plan, so the rule `EliminateDistinct` and `EliminateAggregateFilter` can not optimize the non-root node. We should use `transformAllExpressions` rather than `transformExpressions`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only change plan\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd new test for  `EliminateDistinct` and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCompared to the default behavior, the current ANSI type coercion rules don't allow the following cases:\r\n\r\n- Comparing String with other simple types, e.g. `str_col > date'2022-01-01'`\r\n- Arithmetic operation containing String and other simple types\r\n- Union/Intersect/Except containing String and other simple types\r\n- SQL function expects non-string types but got  string input\r\n- other SQL operators..\r\n\r\nThis PR is to remove the limitation. After changes, the String type can be implicit cast as Long/Double/Date/Timestamp/Boolean/Binary.\r\n\r\nNote that Byte/Short/Int is not on the precedent list of String: `str_col > 1` will become `cast(str_col as long) > 1L`. So that we can avoid string parsing error if the string is out of the range of Byte/Short/Int in comparison/arithmetic/union operations.\r\nThe design applies to Float/Decimal (especially Decimal), for SQL operators containing Float/Decimal and String, the type coercion system will convert both as Double.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/153430898-1f4eca1e-d72b-4714-831f-ff697a046f93.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe purpose of the current limitation is to prevent potential String parsing errors under ANSI mode. However, after doing research among real-world Spark SQL queries, I find that **many users are actually using String as Date/Timestamp/Numeric/etc in their queries**.  For example, the purpose of query `where str_col > date'2022-01-01'` is quite obvious, but users have to rewrite it as `where cast(str_col as date) > date'2022-01-01'` under ANSI mode.\r\nTo make the migration to ANSI mode easier, I suggest removing this limitation. Let's treat it as an extension in our SQL dialect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, allow implicitly casting String to other simple types under ANSI mode\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn current `HiveexternalCatalog.listpartitions`, it use\r\n```\r\n  final def getPartitions(\r\n      db: String,\r\n      table: String,\r\n      partialSpec: Option[TablePartitionSpec]): Seq[CatalogTablePartition] = {\r\n    getPartitions(getTable(db, table), partialSpec)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIt call `geTables` to get a raw HiveTable then convert it to a CatalogTable, in `getPartitions` it re-convert it to a HiveTable.\r\nThis cause a conflicts since in HiveTable we store schema as lowercase but for bucket cols and sort cols it didn't convert it to lowercase.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, we directly pass raw HiveTable to HiveClient's request to avoid unnecessary convert and potential conflicts, also  respect case sensitivity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen user create a hive bucket table with upper case schema, the table schema will be stored as lower cases while bucket column info will stay the same with user input.\r\n\r\nif we try to insert into this table, an HiveException reports bucket column is not in table schema.\r\n\r\nhere is a simple repro\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\r\n  CREATE TABLE TEST1(\r\n    V1 BIGINT,\r\n    S1 INT)\r\n  PARTITIONED BY (PK BIGINT)\r\n  CLUSTERED BY (V1)\r\n  SORTED BY (S1)\r\n  INTO 200 BUCKETS\r\n  STORED AS PARQUET \"\"\").show\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"INSERT INTO TEST1 SELECT * FROM

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR explicitly sets the ANSI to false in the timestampNTZ/timestamp.sql input itself, and in the `SQLQueryTestSuite` when the input doesn't match with any of `PgSQLTest`, `AnsiTest` or `TimestampNTZTest`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWithout this change, `ThriftServerQueryTestSuite` will fail on timestampNTZ/timestamp.sql, when ANSI is on by default. It is because the timestampNTZ/timestamp.sql should only work with ANSI off according to the golden result file, but ThriftServerQueryTestSuite or the timestamp.sql test doesn't override the default ANSI setting. \r\nThe same goes with the `SQLQueryTestSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange BufferSetterGetterUtils to use `InternalRow.setLong` for TIMESTAMP_NTZ values rather then `InternalRow.update`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen a query aggregates a TIMESTAMP_NTZ column using a UDAF that extends `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`, Spark will use `TungstenAggregationIterator`, which creates an `UnsafeRow` for the low-level aggregation buffer.\r\n\r\nHowever, the wrapper of that buffer (`MutableAggregationBufferImpl`) fails to properly set up a field setter function for the TIMESTAMP_NTZ column, so it attempts to call `UnsafeRow.update` on the underlying buffer. The UnsafeRow instance throws `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.UnsafeRow.update(UnsafeRow.java:218)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.BufferSetterGetterUtils.$anonfun$createSetters$15(udaf.scala:217)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.BufferSetterGetterUtils.$anonfun$createSetters$15$adapted(udaf.scala:215)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.MutableAggregationBufferImpl.update(udaf.scala:272)\r\n  at MyAverage$.initialize(<console>:52)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.ScalaUDAF.initialize(udaf.scala:450)\r\n\r\n```\r\nSee the Jira (SPARK-38146) for a full reproduction example.\r\n\r\nBefore the fix for SPARK-38133, `UnsafeRow` did not consider TIMESTAMP_NTZ as mutable or fixed size, so Spark would use `SortBasedAggregationIterator`, which would created a `GenericInternalRow` for the underlying buffer rather than an `UnsafeRow` instance. Therefore, before SPARK-38133, a UDAF could aggegrate a TIMESTAMP_NTZ column.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTurned back on testing of TIMESTAMP_NTZ in the unit test \"udaf with all data types\" in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR blocks lateral subqueries that contain DISTINCT aggregate and correlated non-equality predicates in CheckAnalysis.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid incorrect results. `DISTINCT` will be rewritten into Aggregate during the optimization phase and only correlated equality predicates are supported with Aggregate.\r\n\r\nNote, we only need to block this pattern for lateral subqueries because 1) Scalar subqueries are either aggregated or can only contain one row, so they will not encounter this issue 2) IN/EXISTS subqueries can potentially have the same issue but it won't impact the results of these subqueries, for example, `SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 IN (SELECT DISTINCT c1 FROM t2 WHERE t1.c1 > t2.c1)`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Queries with lateral joins that contain DISTINCT aggregate will be blocked:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 JOIN LATERAL (SELECT DISTINCT c2 FROM t2 WHERE c1 > t1.c1)\r\n\r\nAnalysisException: Correlated column is not allowed in predicate\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to propagate `SparkThrowable` to user space AS IS in constructing of function builder. This allows to preserve the error class, for instance.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issues portrayed by the example below:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> try { sql(\"select format_string('%0$s', 'Hello')\") } catch { case e: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException => println(e.getErrorClass) }\r\nnull\r\n``` \r\nThe expected error should be `ILLEGAL_SUBSTRING`. It sets at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/899d3bb44d7c72dc0179545189ac8170bde993a8/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/errors/QueryCompilationErrors.scala#L71.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes exceptions that can be handles by users.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> try { sql(\"select format_string('%0$s', 'Hello')\") } catch { case e: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException => println(e.getErrorClass) }\r\nILLEGAL_SUBSTRING\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, LikeSimplification rule is skipped if the pattern in LIKE filter contains an escape character.\r\nThus, the filter \"LIKE '%100\\\\%'\" in this query is not optimized into 'EndsWith' of StringType.\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM tbl LIKE '%100\\\\%'\").explain(true)\r\n\r\n...\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter

character if the special character follows an escape character. By doing that, LikeSimplification rule can optimize the filter like below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM tbl LIKE '%100\\\\%'\").explain(true)\r\n\r\n...\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28527, we change to create table under the database location when the table location is relative. However the criteria to determine if a table location is relative/absolute is `URI.isAbsolute`, which basically checks if the table location URI has a scheme defined. So table URIs like `/table/path` are treated as relative and the scheme and authority of the database location URI are used to create the table. For example, when the database location URI is `s3a://bucket/db`, the table will be created at `s3a://bucket/table/path`, while it should be created under the file system defined in `SessionCatalog.hadoopConf` instead.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes that by treating table location as absolute when the first letter of its path is slash.\r\n\r\nThis also applies to alter table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is to fix the behavior described above. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. When users try to create/alter a table with a location that starts with a slash but without a scheme defined, the table will be created under/altered to the file system defined in `SessionCatalog.hadoopConf`, instead of the one defined in the database location URI.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated unit tests.","created_at":"2022-02-09T13:00:41Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T01:45:28Z","closed_at":"2022-02-21T03:30:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cbc03cbb54f2ef90f237d838476f760c7382295e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cd16730f0881b4636b6266d3d0d74a224dbcdb47","head":{"label":"bozhang2820:spark-31709","ref":"spark-31709","sha":"cd16730f0881b4636b6266d3d0d74a224dbcdb47","user":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":295316675,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTUzMTY2NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"bozhang2820/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd new SQL function: try_subtract and try_multiply. The two new functions are identical to the add operator `-` and `*`, except that they return `NULL` result instead of throwing an exception on integral value overflow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimilar to try_add and try_divide:\r\n1. Users can manage to finish queries without interruptions in ANSI mode.\r\n2. Users can get NULLs instead of unreasonable results if overflow occurs when ANSI mode is off.\r\nFor example, the behavior of the following SQL operations is unreasonable:\r\n```\r\n2147483647 * 2 => -2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the new safe version SQL functions:\r\n```\r\ntry_multiply(2147483647, 2) => null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, new SQL function: try_subtract and try_multiply\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

request?\r\nWhen we do shuffle on indeterminate expressions such as `rand`, and ShuffleFetchFailed happend, we may get incorrent result since it only retries failed map tasks.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, suppose we have a dataset with two columns `(range(1, 5) as a, rand() as b)`, we shuffle by `b` using two map tasks and two reduce tasks.\r\n<img width=\"630\" alt=\"image\"

partitions maybe different compared with last attempt, and finally we get a duplicate record with a = 4**\r\n<img width=\"610\" alt=\"image\"

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe code of method: populateStartOffsets in class: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.MicroBatchExecution is modified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn some unexpected cases, commit and offset are inconsistent, and offset is not written into HDFS continuously, as follows:\r\n\r\n            commits\r\n            /tmp/streaming_xxxxxxxx/commits/113256\r\n            /tmp/streaming_xxxxxxxx/commits/113257\r\n\r\n            offsets\r\n            /tmp/streaming_xxxxxxxx/offsets/113257\r\n            /tmp/streaming_xxxxxxxx/offsets/113259\r\n           \r\nWhen we start the streaming program, batch ${latestBatchId - 1} is 113258, but offsets 113258 doesn't exist, an exception will be thrown, resulting in the program cannot be started. As an improvement, Spark doesn‘t need to repair itself, but we could probably do some simply analysis and give better error message.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nAn error message is logged if the exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, just add an error

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-31007 introduce an auxiliary statistics to speed up computation in KMeasn.\r\n\r\nHowever, it needs a array of size `k * (k + 1) / 2`, which may cause overflow or OOM when k is too large.\r\n\r\nSo we should skip this optimization in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\navoid overflow or OOM when k is too large (like 50,000)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd check in `PartitionPruning` if the partition has static filter. So we can skip add dynamic partition pruning if there already exists.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDynamic partition pruning add a filter as long as the join condition contains partition columns. But if there exists other condition which contains the static partition pruning, it's unnecessary to add an extra dynamic partition pruning.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1 (c1 int) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (p1 string);\r\nCREATE TABLE t2 (c2 int) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (p2 string);\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.p1 = t2.p2 and t1.p1 = 'a' AND t2.c2 > 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only change the plan\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord
