Description ##\r\nThis PR adds a 2nd 'auxiliary' stream to a RunContext and makes it available to operators.  This PR includes a modification of the Backward() operation of the cudnn implementation of Convolution to run both the dgrad and wgrad kernels in parallel, rather than in series.  For large batchsizes (e.g. 256), each of these kernels consumes all of a GPU and the training performance improvement is negligible.  However, when the per-GPU batchsize is small (e.g. 32, as is desirable for fast 'scale out' training that maintains accuracy), the performance improvement is in the neighborhood of 2-3%.  More details in a follow-up comment.\r\n\r\nBy default, this PR does not affect the behavior of the framework.  However, by setting the environment variable MXNET_GPU_WORKER_NSTREAMS=2, the cudnn Convolution backward dgrad and wgrad will be run in separate streams.  The resulting speed-up comes with a modest downside- now the kernel workspace areas cannot be shared, so the model global memory footprint size grows by 2-3% in the case of Resnet50.  This is of no consequence for the main application area of this new feature- small batchsize (per GPU) training.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is this can be a useful optional knob for users, particularly those attempting to duplicate published MLPERF results.  This PR includes a test of cudnn vs. no_cudnn Convolution with MXNET_GPU_WORKER_NSTREAMS set to both 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable

of MXNet are exposed to the commons-codec and commons-io library versions MXNet uses internally. This change excludes those JARs from the JARs created with `make scalapkg`.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nThis PR removes commons-codec and commons-io from the assembled JAR and adds both packages as dependencies in deploy.xml\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-1302) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] commons-io and commons-codec remove from assembled JAR\r\n- [x] commons-io and commons-codec added as dependencies to deploy.xml\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nMy Maven knowledge is sparse so I may have missed something.\r\n\r\nFor testing:\r\n* The JAR no longer contains org.apache.commons classes\r\n* make scalapkg && make scalaunittests && make scalaintegrationtests passed on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine (JDK

documentation as of V 1.3.1, I wasn't 100% clear on how detailed return type documentation should be. I also wasn't sure of the preferred terms to use for certain aspects of the MXNet Symbol library. For instance, is saying that a Symbol 'resolves' to shape (m,n,x,y) an accurate description? Given the complexity of some of the .random.* APIs, it seems useful to get into the details of the structure of the output. \r\n\r\nHappy to make changes if someone more central to the project has preferences!\r\n\r\nAlso, I was not able to build the docs on OSX or Ubuntu, this seemed to be a general problem with any version of the MXNet project. I'm going to lean on the CI tools for the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-26T00:40:39Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T01:54:58Z","closed_at":"2019-01-30T01:54:58Z","merged_at":"2019-01-30T01:54:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"e37ff53f0a3a0cc9276a7a1d4aff0deab91c40df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":707556117,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTYxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis pull request adds the possibility of changing the `grad_req` of `BucketingModule` to values other than the default `'write'` in the Python interface.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `grad_req` would default to `'write'` every time the bucket is switched causing gradient accumulation not to work whenever a non-default bucket key was used.\r\n\r\nAlso a new unit-test case has been added to test 1. the correct binding of sub-modules and 2. gradient accumulation with different `grad_req` values. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] BucketingModule now remembers `grad_req` from bind() call. ,\r\n- [x] Unit-test for different values of `grad_req` for BucketingModule.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-25T00:24:15Z","updated_at":"2019-01-27T05:37:51Z","closed_at":"2019-01-27T05:37:51Z","merged_at":"2019-01-27T05:37:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc98c0d03666bdafae7954180074125c7329a42d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556117,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTYxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

this PR, the performance is comparable with 1.3.1 using the same training settings.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we add a device_id parameter to the ImageRecParserParam struct such that we can set the device id for the CPUPinned context when creating ImageRecordIter. This newly exposed device_id allows training with large batch_size using Horovod. Users can also set device_id to -1 indicating that they want to use CPU(0) context which saves memory usage on GPU.\r\n\r\n**===1.4.x with this PR===**\r\n```\r\nINFO:root:Epoch[0] Batch

inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-24T00:43:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T22:28:56Z","closed_at":"2019-01-28T21:34:41Z","merged_at":"2019-01-28T21:34:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"c4080def0ef36b4f69ae0927b31ced6dcba6f9df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdding Iterables instead of List to method signature for infer APIs in Java to expand the input types they can take in.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible as List is a subclass implementing the Iterables interface.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds a second mirror when downloading the maven binary as the first might show flaky behavior (http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/mxnet-validation%2Funix-cpu/detail/PR-13966/1/pipeline). Additionally, it adds the \"set -ex\" to the ubuntu publish install script to avoid silent failures.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n@marcoabreu @lanking520 @piyushghai @andrewfayres

Description ##\r\nTh example contains call to WaitAll() function that are not required in some places.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [y] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [y] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [y] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\nThe example contains the unit_test_inception_inference.sh. Ensured that the test continues to pass.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-23T18:48:18Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T23:08:25Z","closed_at":"2019-01-25T19:14:34Z","merged_at":"2019-01-25T19:14:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1c063ebc017d175bd8f6f4d5027f8e178388c58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13972/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13972/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13972/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/acfb818c71327d0291e24e3936dce394518fae28","head":{"label":"leleamol:fix_inception","ref":"fix_inception","sha":"acfb818c71327d0291e24e3936dce394518fae28","user":{"login":"leleamol","id":19983848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTgzODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19983848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol","html_url":"https://github.com/leleamol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113224097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTMyMjQwOTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"leleamol/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leleamol","id":19983848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTgzODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19983848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol","html_url":"https://github.com/leleamol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leleamol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leleamol/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13959\r\nThis PR creates new error pages, uses some better regex's in the `.htaccess` file, and it provides better artifact handling for the build process.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Changed the `ErrorDocument` for 404 errors to a local file instead of using a hard-coded link to the error page in production. This is partly why we ended up with a redirect loop. It also had the drawback of giving a 302 redirect header instead of 404. Bots 🤖 don't like that, plus it was probably fooling the broken link checker. \r\n- [x] Generalized the redirects for pages that should be current (thanks @ddavydenko!).\r\n- [x] Deleted unnecessary artifacts (index.html was from an old workaround and is not used)\r\n- [x] Created two new html error pages that don't use relative links to assets as this fails when being loaded dynamically for a 404 message.\r\n- [x] Updated the Sphinx script to copy these error pages when doing a local build\r\n- [x] Moved the `mxnet.css` artifact copy to the Sphinx script function to better consolidate artifact and build updates; also this help make sure that any updates to css in your dev version will get applied during a local build AND a full website publish\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\n\r\nAside from the [redirect test links](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Redirects+on+the+Website), you can try:\r\n* The new [404 error page](http://34.201.8.176/versions/local_error/error/404.html)\r\n* The new [API error page](http://34.201.8.176/versions/local_error/error/api.html)\r\n🌮  Break things with a random URL like: http://34.201.8.176/versions/local_error/tacos\r\n❓ Look for an API doc that doesn't exist, like Clojure for v0.11.0: http://34.201.8.176/versions/0.11.0/api/clojure/index.html\r\n\r\nNote that I redirect 🌮 requests or anything really in an API subfolder's that is designated in the .htaccess file to the API error, rather than the 404 error. This way we can say, well, maybe it does exist, so try a different version. \r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nUnfortunately, for some reason `ErrorDocument` converts the environment variable for `default_version` just fine, but then just outputs the URL as text to the browser rather that forcing a redirect. So it has to stay hard-coded to `master`. (That's fine anyway as I can't imagine why an error page could be the latest at all

Description ##\r\nThere is performance issue with OpenBLAS 0.3.4. For CNN model it's 10-20% slower then ATLAS. \r\nThe issue has been fixed in OpenBLAS 0.3.5.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-22T06:42:38Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T06:25:30Z","closed_at":"2019-01-31T06:25:30Z","merged_at":"2019-01-31T06:25:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"47277b09667df09158bc192768099316d404d0d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":270131542,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzAxMzE1NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/R","name":"R","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nthis is the part 3 of the changes to solve pylint errors in examples with issue #12205 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-20T04:32:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T08:39:48Z","closed_at":"2019-03-14T08:39:48Z","merged_at":"2019-03-14T08:39:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"9fd31536864ae64f82898f563687d8711cddcf49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556117,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTYxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

PR adds an optional dmlc::Error* argument in MXNet engine callback functions. The callers can leverage this argument to populate errors back to MXNet engine through callback such that the errors can be handled properly by MXNet engine. It is needed to populate the errors detected in Horovod back to MXNet engine for Hovorod and MXNet integration (see [PR](https://github.com/ctcyang/horovod/pull/24)).

PR adds an optional dmlc::Error* argument in MXNet engine callback functions. The callers can leverage this argument to populate errors back to MXNet engine through callback such that the errors can be handled properly by MXNet engine. It is needed to populate the errors detected in Horovod back to MXNet engine for Hovorod and MXNet integration (see [PR](https://github.com/ctcyang/horovod/pull/24)).

Description ##\r\nAdd new transformer in Gluon \"Batchify\". This transformer joins/batchify a list of tensors of shape (C x H x W) into a single tensor of shape (N x C x H x W).\r\n\r\nThis will be helpful when users have created a fused end to end model (transformers + network), saved the graph and this end to end model is deployed in production for \"single request inference\" or \"mini-batch inference\". The raw input can be of different shapes, till the input reaches resize transformation, if running a mini batch inference, then input will be a list of NDArrays. After Resize, these individual NDArrays will batched with this transformer.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes some usability problems with the version selector. You tend to lose your place when you use the search feature or when browsing the APIs looking for stuff. If you switch versions, you don't always end up where you were or get redirected to the home page. \r\n\r\n**EDIT**: It also fixes a search bug for developers that try to use the search feature in their dev versions of the website.\r\n\r\n## Preview for Search\r\nWhen you search for something on the website in an older version, don't find it, then switch to a newer version, you are redirected to the root of the website. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. Search for \"taco\": http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/1.0.0/search.html?q=taco&check_keywords=yes&area=default\r\nNo 🌮 ! What if master has 🌮 ? \r\n2. Use the versions dropdown and change to master.\r\nYou lost your search! 😭 and still no 🌮 .\r\n\r\nNow try to search for 🌮 on the preview:\r\n1. http://34.201.8.176/versions/1.3.1/search.html?q=taco\r\nNo 🌮 . \r\n2. Change to master. \r\nStill no 🌮 but 🌤 you didn't get bounced to the home page.\r\n\r\n## Preview for Anchors\r\nIt seems to work now when the page is loaded anew. However, I noticed that using in-page anchors the page didn't provide a new `window.location.hash` to the function in `docversion.js` that updates the version dropdown's links, so the when switching versions you don't load the last anchor you were on. \r\n\r\n1. Go look at ndarray docs: http://34.201.8.176/versions/1.3.1/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html\r\n2. Scroll down and click the link for `ndarray.shape`.\r\n3. You jump down to the docs for shape. But you decide you don't like it, and you want to know if master has more features. Your current location is now http://34.201.8.176/versions/1.3.1/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.shape\r\n4. Use the version dropdown to change to Master.\r\n5. Witness 👀  that you are now on: http://34.201.8.176/versions/master/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.shape\r\n\r\nIf you try this flow in production you see that it is kind of broken.\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nThe redirects update and overview of intentions and test links are on the wiki: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Redirects+on+the+Website\r\n\r\nThe search feature on the website is buggy. Today it shows results in an old version that shouldn't be there. For example \"allreduce\" shouldn't appear <v1.2.1, but it does today. I'm not trying to fix Sphinx's search in this

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-17T05:18:14Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T09:40:29Z","closed_at":"2019-01-23T22:11:24Z","merged_at":"2019-01-23T22:11:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"f033aec603c75547f6abcb95d779650a0e1b5025","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-17T01:51:27Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T22:28:58Z","closed_at":"2019-01-18T00:25:07Z","merged_at":"2019-01-18T00:25:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"34a2dc85c052c5ea2ac17cf4fdb6cb97cd1efea8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nFix #13710 \r\n\r\nIn bipartite match, the temporary workspace size is miscalculated and not enough to hold the index tensor.\r\n\r\nSince it is related to `sizeof(DType)` and `sizeof(int32_t)`, the bug is only triggered on some platforms.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-16T05:40:36Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T22:41:30Z","closed_at":"2019-01-16T22:35:19Z","merged_at":"2019-01-16T22:35:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"bf86caa886cfc2e06dde131ed3c290559d418cac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

This update also fixes some bugs when building inference engines that were resulting in feature vectors that were very different from what they should have been.\r\n\r\nFixes #12598\r\nFixes #13113\r\n\r\nMaster PR with review history: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13310\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\nMarco:\r\nResolves

Since cudnn 7, `cudnnRestoreDropoutDescriptor` becomes available so that the initialized space can be cached. This descriptor is currently used in both Dropout op and RNN op. We need a mechanism for caching this so that initialization on each stream happens only once, as the same desc can be shared among operators.","created_at":"2019-01-16T04:43:05Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T05:37:03Z","closed_at":"2019-02-05T18:20:05Z","merged_at":"2019-02-05T18:20:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"18b8704491640b126e344e6c81d1b6da90eae64e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13896/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13896/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13896/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ba725eb8ba31dad84caeb536afb6d41d2468d62f","head":{"label":"szha:cudnn_dropout","ref":"cudnn_dropout","sha":"ba725eb8ba31dad84caeb536afb6d41d2468d62f","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92538952,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MjUzODk1Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"szha/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/szha/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\na new script file example/sparse/wide_deep/inference.py\r\nReadme also slightly revised.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-16T03:47:14Z","updated_at":"2019-02-16T11:06:25Z","closed_at":"2019-02-16T11:06:25Z","merged_at":"2019-02-16T11:06:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"8bfbb7de46ce309e1935967ea2dfeb99f8d8a1f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR ensures that the build flag USE_MKLDNN is set to FALSE, for cases of cross-compilation when using cmake builds. Right now, CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING flag is TRUE only for ARM v6, v7, v8 processors.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] MKLDNN not turned on by default in case of cross compilation\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-16T01:25:52Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T10:47:01Z","closed_at":"2019-01-19T02:53:16Z","merged_at":"2019-01-19T02:53:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"e8a2b8b9fdafaccbf65397cec142fffcae2289b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yajiedesign","id":771744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTc0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign","html_url":"https://github.com/yajiedesign","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yajiedesign/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR improves performance of hybridized Gluon models on the GPU by better bulking of ops (running GPU ops without synchronization).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] For models hybridized with `hybridize()` engine currently creates `ImperativeBulk` op that combines multiple operations into 1. However, this `ImperativeBulk` op captures entire ops, including synchronization at the end. Since the engine dependencies are only updated at the very end of the `ImperativeBulk` op, having this synchronization is wasteful. This PR changes the RunContext structure so that `ImperativeBulk` op is able to inform the bulked ops that it will handle the synchronization itself. Imperative ops check that argument to determine whether they need to perform their own synchronization.\r\n- [x] For models hybridized with `hybridize(static_alloc=True, static_Shape=True)` there is currently another mechanism of bulking, similar to the one used in symbolic API. However, it very aggressively  excludes ops from being eligible for bulking - any op that produces output from forward pass (which means most of the ops) cannot be bulked. This is artificial limitation and this PR lifts it.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- With this PR `hybridize(static_alloc=True)` and `hybridize(static_alloc=True, static_shape=True)` become pretty similar in performance for single GPU tests. The main 2 differences seem to be:\r\n   - a difference in the time it takes to start the forward pass (which I did not yet investigate, but non-static shape seems to take more time to start)\r\n   - the fact that `ImperativeBulk` is a temporary `ThreadedEngineOpr` destroyed at the end of its invocation, which seems to be a relatively expensive operation (hybridized model with everything static mostly does not use `ImperativeBulk` so does not pay the cost of destruction of the object).\r\n- I will post some performance comparisons in a future comment. \r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin @piiswrong

title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nTemporarily disable website builds.  Work around for #13833.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- It seems it's difficult to disable a task within this pipeline as then we don't get a status report back.  As a work around I've disabled the problematic document publishing piece rather than disabling the whole task. \r\n","created_at":"2019-01-15T16:14:06Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T23:16:27Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T23:16:27Z","merged_at":"2019-01-15T23:16:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d4281271c871a938f1ac4ee55b218872031963d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nAdding ability to use int32 arrays, or any castable-to-int type, as\r\nthe sequence_length array to SequenceMask, SequenceLast, and\r\nSequenceReverse. Previously these operaters all requred sequence_length\r\nto be the same data type as the input array.\r\n\r\nSee MxNet Jira ticket here:\r\n  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1295\r\n\r\nSee also GitHub issues here:\r\n   https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12649\r\n   https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/346\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test Coverage ##\r\nI have tested this works by building locally and running all the Sequence* operators in python with a float32 input array and an int32 sequence_length array. I confirmed things work correct.\r\n\r\nHowever when I looked at the unit tests it was not immediately clear how to add an appropriate test, because the current tests all use the `check_symbolic_forward()` function, which takes a single dtype for all arguments and doesn't allow clients to specify different dtypes for different input arguments.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nfix compiling error in debug mode\r\ni.e. the latest 'BufferEntry' do not contain ctx function calls, and it will result in a compiling error.\r\ninside of BufferEntry is an object of NDArray, which is the expected data.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-14T13:06:33Z","updated_at":"2019-02-05T05:04:55Z","closed_at":"2019-01-28T21:42:41Z","merged_at":"2019-01-28T21:42:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"dbbd252b14a3cd45524d3b1218297e73b266b6ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708189887,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgxODk4ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/KVStore","name":"KVStore","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nFix #13847\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nThis is a hot-fix for #13859. Temporary disable MKL-DNN for building R-Package since it needs plan and time to evaluate the functionality, stability and performance of R when building MXNet with MKL-DNN.\r\n@TaoLv @pengzhao-intel \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-13T06:55:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T06:28:33Z","closed_at":"2019-01-31T06:28:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3efd02284a4c73c3ee3f9d465b86eb8ea1beb5d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":270131542,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzAxMzE1NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/R","name":"R","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe number of parallel threads for GPU random number generation is controlled by two variables: `kMinNumRandomPerThread ` and `kNumRandomStates `.  \r\nBased on https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/random/sampler.h#L54-L55: \r\n```\r\nnum_thread = min(num_elements/min_num_rand_per_thread, num_random_states)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently these values are fixed, which is not idle depending on the size of the tensor to generate. For large tensors, increasing `kNumRandomStates` / reducing `kMinNumRandomPerThread` may help. However, increasing `kNumRandomStates` leads to higher gpu memory usage, while reducing `kMinNumRandomPerThread` may lead to higher scheduling overhead. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes these variables configurable via env vars. \r\n\r\nTuning these values also help operators such as Dropout which needs random numbers. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created

Description ##\r\n\r\n- This PR modifies the clojure CNN text classification example. It tries to come close to the python-based example and also fixes some bugs.\r\n- It can be used with pretrained embeddings such as `:glove` or `:word2vec`. It can also be used without any pretrained embedding in which case an embedding is learned from training data.\r\n- There was an issue with using pretrained embeddings where a new random vector (uniformly sampled) was generated for the same word in the vocabulary if it appeared multiple times across the corpus. This PR fixes that issue by generating a random vector just once per out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. This also helps avoid the memory `GC limit exceeded` issue.\r\n- Finally, it can be used with `word2vec` embeddings which required some tweaks in the way the model was being loaded. To optimize memory usage, either `max-vectors` can be loaded or a `vocab` can be passed in so that only a subset of embeddings are loaded.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel

Description ##\r\n\r\nMakes tweaks to the infer package to make it more friendly by using Clojure data structures for inputs and outputs to functions. Also add tests to cover all the infer functions.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Change inputs and outputs of the infer functions to be Clojure data structures where possible\r\n- Add unit tests to cover all the infer functions\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n\r\nObject detection now returns a map structure ex:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n{:class car, :prob 0.99847263, :x-min 0.6097917, :y-min 0.1406818, :x-max 0.8906532, :y-max

Description ##\r\nWhile trying to get all the CI runners to pass for PR #13749, I discovered that the handling of the float32->float16 cast on the CPU varies based on whether the f16c library is available and enabled.  If the f16c library is not available, as is the case for the Windows CI runner using a MSVC++ compiler, then the mshadow float2half() routine is used and the cast is performed by truncating the bits that don't fit in the float16 representation.  The _cvtss_sh(data, 0) call employed by mshadow when the f16c library is present performs a round-to-nearest conversion, with ties rounded to the value with a 0 LSB.  This round-to-nearest-even policy also is employed by the default GPU context implementation and numpy.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve MXNet model and CI consistency across all backends, I'm correcting the mshadow float2half() implementation to perform matching round-to-nearest-even rounding. The first commit introduces only a test that demonstrates the problem, which I am expecting to fail on the Windows CI runner.  Then I'll work up an mshadow PR with the new float2half() routine.  Next, I'll change the mshadow commit used by MXNet to point to this PR, to demonstrate its effectiveness.  Once the mshadow PR has been accepted, I'll change the mshadow commit used by MXNet once again so the PR can be accepted.\r\n\r\nThis PR should only effect models run without the f16c library on a CPU.  I intend to make the round-to-nearest-even behavior the new default for these scenarios, bringing them in line with other systems.  I'll provide a simple build flag to restore the legacy behavior.  My new float2half() implementation is 50% faster on the cpu despite the additional rounding logic.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-12T00:36:15Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T21:04:37Z","closed_at":"2019-01-30T21:04:37Z","merged_at":"2019-01-30T21:04:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"c939c2d55e9789a367ffb95b5a78ec5aa2fd35c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nFixes tree reduction failing on new instance type `p3dn.24xlarge`, which was raised here: https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/issues/520\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Adds a fallback for `cudaDeviceGetP2PAttribute` topology information to use `cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess` when the former is inconsistent across instance types.\r\n- [x] Fixes tree reduction breaking when `cudaDeviceGetP2PAttribute` provides wrong information.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- On p3dn.24xlarge using CUDA 9.0, we observe that the `cudaDeviceGetP2PAttribute` topology looks different compared to when we use CUDA 9.0 with p3.16xlarge:\r\n```\r\n  // Check that all P2P connections are detected by GetP2PAttribute\r\n  // If yes, then continue as before\r\n  // If not, then fallback to using cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess saved in p2p_matrix \r\n  //   (from EnableP2P() in src/kvstore/comm_tree.h)\r\n  //\r\n  // We have observed that with CUDA 9.0 p3.16xlarge:\r\n  //\r\n  //   0 2 2 3 3 1 1 1                . v v v v . . .\r\n  //   2 0 3 2 1 3 1 1                v . v v . v . .\r\n  //   2 3 0 3 1 1 2 1

PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to address an error of \"symbol not found\" during ssd quantization process. \r\nSince there're some Op outputs are not in the format of `{opname}_output`, which results in no calibrated min/max for such variables in quantized param file, and cause the error.\r\nLeave the `calib_layer` to None (which is default) is a safety way to do the calibration.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @ZhennanQin @xinyu-intel @apeforest \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The

Description ##\r\nIn current implemenation, we override signal handler regardless if MXNET_USE_SIGNAL_HANDLER=1.\r\nThis breaks caller process behavior and cause process exit unexpectedly.\r\nThe example use case is libmxnet.so is loadded into java process via JNI or JNA. JVM will crash\r\ndue to SegfaultLogger.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we will not register SegfaultLogger if there is a signal handler registered.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-11T00:39:09Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T05:37:49Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T19:04:43Z","merged_at":"2019-01-15T19:04:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc7ea3101f8fe486e25e47b6097f04ef52716313","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR
