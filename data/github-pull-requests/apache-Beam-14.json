if `upload_graph` is specified we error out when using runner v2. This is exacerbated because we auto-opt in large graphs to this option, so some pipelines can fail without a user even enabling this option.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the problem and does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Doesn't auto-opt in runner v2 pipelines\r\n2. Warns and removes the `upload_graph` option for runner v2 pipelines if it is explicitly set.\r\n\r\nFixes #32159\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

atleast one poll to Kafka cluster to complete, before returning\r\n\r\naddresses #21630\r\n\r\nContext: (pulled from the bug above)\r\n\r\nThe [consumerPollLoop](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaUnboundedReader.java#L515) that polls data via a Kafka Consumer if there's no pending data already, and offers it to the availableRecordsQueue otherwise. It calls the [nextBatch function](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaUnboundedReader.java#L573) repeatedly until an attempt to [fetch an element from the avaliableRecordsQueue](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaUnboundedReader.java#L580) times out. After the timeout, it returns the control to the worker and it may take relatively long time until the loop is scheduled again.\r\n\r\nThis is what we think is happening when the poll latency is high:\r\n\r\nconsumerPollLoop fetches data bundle from Kafka via poll() and offers it to the avaliableRecordsQueue\r\nmessage processing loop fetches bundle from avaliableRecordsQueue and unblocks the consumerPollLoop\r\nconsumerPollLoop calls poll() again\r\nmessage processing loop completes processing the bundle BEFORE the poll() call above completes, and tries to fetch next bundle from avaliableRecordsQueue.\r\nfetch from avaliableRecordsQueue has a very short timeout (10ms) and if it expires before the pending poll() in the consumerPollLoop completes the message processing loop will believe there's no fresh data in Kafka and exit. All the time until the message processing loop is rescheduled is wasted.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents the above by waiting for at least one poll to complete before we complete the message processing loop, so even if polling latency degrades, we wait for it to finish to process the new messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Prism wasn't decoding *all* timers returned in the logical timer stream, dropping later set timers.\r\n  * Moved timer decoding to be iterator compatible for the future, instead of trying to reprocess inplace, or returning the remaining byte buffer.\r\n* From there supporting clearing timers was simple, by additionally returning the window set, and deleting existing entries to the pending timer list. \r\n* Needed to re-write + override the timer clearing test, since for some reason the test DoFn would not execute when there were multiple timer parameters to the DoFn.\r\n\r\nAllows a few of the Python timer based tests to pass.\r\n\r\nTODO for a different test: Support interval and custom window functions for timers.\r\n\r\nFixes #32115\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you

define Beam imports for callables**\r\n* PR adds explicit beam import statements to inlined python callables. This is technically redundant as 'apache_beam' already gets imported as 'beam' in several places along the codepath, so it is already imported when the callable is run. However, this is not guaranteed to stay this way, and it is more clear to the user than they must import dependencies which are not included on the hidden code path.\r\n\r\n**Add suffix to windowing in a couple examples**\r\n* A couple windowing examples did not include recently added time suffix\r\n\r\n**Upgrade gcloud dataflow yaml command to use non-beta version**\r\n* gcloud dataflow yaml run command was still referencing beta version\r\n\r\nSQL Combine\r\n* The example in the docs was not valid due to a small error in the transform normalizaiton step.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Updates the basic session windowing to correctly aggregate across windows and remove old data.\r\n* Fixes session windowing to respect the correct output timestamp.\r\n* Overrides the fn_runner_test.py test_windowing method to a slightly more robust test, having an inner session, rather than just an first and last. This better validates boundary conditions.\r\n  * There seemed to be a weird interpretation issue WRT the int timestamp converting to microseconds properly. It appears to be done properly in the timestamp type, but I couldn't figure out where the discrepency lies. Prism was receiving the element timestamps as microseconds, but the session gap was correctly converted to microseconds from seconds. \r\n\r\nFixes #32085 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a 2nd PR in the series of PRs (based on the now closed #31648, with the first PR being #31785) whose ultimate goal is to add support for generic classes to schema providers. \r\n\r\n`FieldValueTypeInformation` creators will now accept a `TypeDescriptor` parameter describing the field's containing class, that will let them infer more accurate type information about that field. For example - consider a `MyClass<T>` class - now with a `TypeDescriptor` of `MyClass<String>` and the getter of type `T` the type resolver can infer the type of field to be `String` , see the added test class that shows the new functionality\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR does the following to allow support for HiveCatalog with Managed Iceberg:\r\n- Expose option to pass through Hadoop Configuration properties (this was needed specifically for Hive, but others will benefit from this too)\r\n- Determine what extra dependencies are needed to use HiveCatalog\r\n  - Provide a shaded jar that includes these dependencies\r\n- Add integration tests for reading and writing using HiveCatalog\r\n  - Spin up a local Hive metastore and use a GCS bucket as a warehouse\r\n- Fix bugs in Iceberg conversion utils\r\n\r\nNote that the code in `sdk/io/iceberg/hive/testutils/` (60~70% of this PR) is mostly copied from Iceberg's integration test directory:

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\nIn Python SDK submitting to Dataflow job there is a logic overriding `apache/beam_python3.X_sdk:<label>` to `gcr.io/cloud-dataflow/v1beta3/beam_python3.X_sdk:<label>`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/21009e68eabc9d8e05c5cfadaf5016fa23646fb7/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/dataflow/internal/apiclient.py#L736\r\n\r\nThis generally works except the container has a release candidate tag. which were pushed to dockerhub, e.g. `apache/beam_python3.11_sdk:2.58.0rc2` the corresponding `gcr.io/cloud-dataflow/v1beta3/beam_python3.11_sdk:2.58.0rc2` does not exist, then Dataflow job fails indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThis does not happen for Python job alone, because the `__version__` of the package does not contain \"rcX\" suffix (even though the pypi version name is rcX) and apiclient resolves to 2.XX.0. However, for JavaUsingPython xlang pipeline, this becomes a problem because the parsed in Python SDK version string is used to assemble the docker image, which contains \"rc\" suffix.\r\n\r\nThis affected release candidate validation, e.g. in https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/pull/1761\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

ensures that an SDF makes progress if the runner repeatedly attempts to split the restriction before work has been claimed.\r\nThis affects the Dataflow Runner which attempts to split in streaming pipelines after 5 seconds by default. If the SDF takes over 5 seconds to read the first element and attempt to claim it, the split will occur first, checkpointing the same restriction and the element will be dropped. On retry, it will resume from the same restriction and this may repeat.\r\n\r\nThis matches the behavior of the core java sdf invoker [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/2f93d8bc19917f83d15f531bcbbfb7f36e21ff88/runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/OutputAndTimeBoundedSplittableProcessElementInvoker.java#L309) which didn't start the split thread until the tryClaim was observed.  Having the sdk ignore such split requests seems better than requiring the runner to attempt to time the split better as the sdf may be making progress just not returning any data yet to the runner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Java SDK at the very least examines the ParDoPayload and expects side inputs across all SDF component transforms if the original one does.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, Prism wasn't properly doing graph analysis for these components, so side inputs were being missed. \r\nInitially the side input was only being provided to ProcessSizedElementsAndRestrictions, but this was causing the Java SDK to hang.\r\n\r\nAn attempt at rewriting the ParDoPayload and dropping the side inputs in the other transforms was made, but ultimately failed, since it looked like further stages in the execution relied on other information to detect a side input, or did actually need the side input. It wasn't worth the additional time to investigate further at this stage.\r\n\r\nMinor comment, and debug logging adjustments for readability.\r\n\r\nThis change allows the 6 Java tests that validate side inputs used with SDFs to pass.\r\n\r\nFixes #31992 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
