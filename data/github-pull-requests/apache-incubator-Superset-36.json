SUMMARY\r\nAdded new config keys for Playwright:\r\n- `SCREENSHOT_PLAYWRIGHT_WAIT_UNTIL` - defines an event that Playwright waits for after navigation (default - `load`)\r\n- `SCREENSHOT_PLAYWRIGHT_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` - default timeout for all Playwright operations (default - 30s)\r\n\r\nAdditionally I fixed catching Selenium specific exceptions in Playwright's class.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `PLAYWRIGHT_REPORTS_AND_THUMBNAILS` feature flag\r\n2. To test default timeout - try adding some explicit delays in dashboard's code to trigger timeout. Verify that Playwright times out after the time specified in `SCREENSHOT_PLAYWRIGHT_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`\r\n3. To test navigation wait - you could try to manually block loading of some external script, which prevents the browser from firing a \"load\" event. Playwright should time out on navigation then, with an error that \"load\" event was not detected. Then change `SCREENSHOT_PLAYWRIGHT_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` to another value (for example `'domcontentloaded'`) - navigation should succeed then.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\nInitial work to support a rewrite of the PRESTO_EXPAND_DATA feature for trino. This allows parsing complex structural types described by trino, e.g.\r\n\r\n    row(foo varchar, bar int)\r\n\r\nor arbitrarily deeply nested types like\r\n\r\n    row(foo row(bar array(int)))\r\n\r\nThis parses them into a structural format we can then inspect in order to discover all fields and structures available within them, which is needed in order to expand the results of a `SELECT *` query out into additional rows and columns, or to help autocomplete `dotted.paths` available.\r\n\r\nNote this doesn't yet fully implement `expand_data` for trino, I've tried to break it down into reviewable pieces and I've started with the low-level logic of parsing out the types into something structured. I'll start trying to integrate this into the trino spec and implement `expand_data` next, which will involve analysing this structure to separate the data out into multiple columns like it's being done for presto with `PRESTO_EXPAND_DATA`.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nUnit tests. Currently there's no impact on implementation, as the next steps will be using this type parsing logic to write `expand_data` logic for the `TrinoEngineSpec`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25675 enabling word wrap on text editor and unfixing modal height (previously 350px).\r\n\r\nNote that this enabled word wrap everywhere. I could change it to only apply to the Edit Dataset modal, but I think it makes sense to have this consistently enabled so we can see the most of the SQL expressions, even if it's not manually formatted (adding newlines). \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore, see SQL Expression:\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-10-22

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAs discussed in #25683 this is a follow-up PR to refactor the Elasticsearch time grain expressions to use `DATE_TRUNC` instead of `HISTOGRAM` in order to have consistency.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nTo verify that the time grains still work:\r\n\r\n- Create a database connection to an Elasticsearch cluster\r\n- Create an index in the Elasticsearch cluster. The index documents should have a date field and at least another field to be used in a metric\r\n- Create a dataset using the Elasticsearch database, and the choose the index created previously as the table\r\n- Create a time series chart and use the date field in the x axis\r\n- Select various time grains from the drop down menu and verify that the chart shows the time series data\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThe issue here is that the `isMetric` key for percentage metric is coming up as False from the columns when it is being imported from props. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/4ca6069a-ac0f-4d4c-bde7-15fe3c106581)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we follow the data into the line where we are creating `const valueRange`, we can see that we are calling the `getValueRange` function only when either `isMetric` is True or `isRawRecords` is true.  `isRawRecords` is false for both, and `isMetric` is only true for regular metrics and not percentage metrics. So the `getValueRange` function is not even being called for percentage metrics which is why it is not calculated for these metrics.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/6600007e-5974-4cc9-a36e-e6abb3a1e0ce)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we follow the data further, we can see in the `<StyledCell>` component where we are returning the Cell Bars we have a condition of `valueRange` to not be null in order to display the cell bars. We can verify with console.logs that the `valueRange` is never calculated in the case of percentage metrics and it is null. This is why the cell bars are not showing up for only the percentage metrics because the css class for it is not being added since `valueRange` is null.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/b941ad70-718b-4c08-8e3c-81e70a774bc9)\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\n\r\nA solution that fixed the cell bars for me is adding a separate `key[0] == “%”` in the conditional where we are checking `(isMetric || isRawRecords)` while creating the `const “valueRange”` variable. This ensures none of the other code is messed with and the cell bars still show up.\r\n\r\nAs @michael-s-molina pointed out, we can make it better by using the `isPercentageMetric` property which already exists in `DataColumnMeta`. To do this I Imported it in the `getColumnConfigs` variable from `column` which was imported at the beginning of the file and placed it in the `valueRange` conditional.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/SA-Ark/apache-superset-dev/assets/90512504/7bc1a46a-7f46-4d47-972e-3ae3ab73559c)\r\n\r\nEnd result:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/26e9970b-1bfb-4a85-9155-bcb8ed8a6a05)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/be0af2eb-2762-4cc9-8434-a273e52866de)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate a table chart and add both regular metrics and percentage metrics and enable the show cell bars options.

SUMMARY\r\nWhen loading a dashboard, Superset would always fire a request to `/api/v1/dashboard/{{dashboard_id}}/filter_state?tab_id={{tab_id}}`, regardless if the user has access to interact with this endpoint or not. If the user doesn't have permission, a `403 FORBIDDEN` error is returned, resulting in a console error. \r\n\r\nEven though the error message is expected, a console error is not ideal specially for Embedded implementations in which usually console errors are monitored for the hosting app, for proper troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a validation so that this request is only triggered in case the user has access to it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Before**\r\n<img width=\"1022\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/138a7f81-15a5-4999-a2f5-0a8760baa87e\">\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n<img width=\"1039\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96086495/d8671c11-fa71-4707-890f-ed9da260ea64\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable Embedding (through the `EMBEDDED_SUPERSET` FF).\r\n2. Embed a dashboard into a hosting app.\r\n3. Access it.\r\n4. Validate that there are no console errors.\r\n\r\nAnother potential test:\r\n1. Create a Role without permission to create a dashboard permalink.\r\n2. Publish a test dashboard.\r\n3. Grant this role to a test account.\r\n4. Make sure the test account has access to the published dashboard.\r\n5. Access Superset using this account.\r\n6. Validate that there isn't a console error for this endpoint.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nHaven't seen any means of testing the helm chart in the repo, but we deployed superset with the current changes, and it worked fine.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nReinstate the previous fix and adjust the default sqlite connection string to prevent the issue which caused us to revert it\r\n\r\nSQLite seems to be a bit pedantic about multi-threaded access here, and seems to think we're sharing its objects between threads, though we haven't actually accessed the sqlite database from the extra thread.\r\n\r\nWe can prevent it being so pedantic with the check_same_thread=false option, so configure that by default with our basic development sqlite backend.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

with the default sqlite3 as a backend and configure a trino database, e.g. by running the `apache/superset` docker image with trino driver added\r\n- Execute a query in trino\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n#23872 released in Superset 3.0.0 introduced a regression to Dremio SQL generation as described by my issue here: #25554. \r\n\r\nThe regression causes Superset to not give aliases to SELECT'ed columns, which means that when Superset tries to join a table onto itself using a subquery, it tries to join using an alias that has not been defined. See the difference between the generated SQL queries here:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/16308697/0bd5aa3f-da1d-42e0-b61a-28eb9a214c2a)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe error the author describes in #23872 is not an issue with the Dremio functionality in Superset, rather it was due to an error in Dremio that has been fixed in Dremio version 24.1.0. See the fixes introduced by 24.1.0 in the [Dremio changelog](https://docs.dremio.com/current/release-notes/version-240-release/):\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/16308697/2c9edd12-3c80-40e7-be23-a9de9bcf786a)\r\n\r\nTo verify that it actually works I have executed the exact query reported to be problematic in an updated Dremio instance, which works as expected:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/16308697/66b82230-b186-42cb-91b9-8a996a800abb)\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts the changes introduced in #23872 \r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Create a new chart that has the options of Series Limit against a table in Dremio. Eg. Time-Series Chart, Area Chart etc.\r\n2. Set required fields and Series Limit\r\n3. Click Create Chart.\r\n4. The chart is rendered correctly since the generated SQL is now valid and can be executed successfully by Dremio.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nProphet 1.1.5 adds support for M2 chipsets on which installation is currently failing. In addition, the current version of `pip-tools` is failing with `pip-compile-multi`, making it impossible to update the lock files. By upgrading to 7.3.0 the problem appears to go away. After updating the dependencies files, a few redundant libraries are also removed from the lock files.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhile installing Superset via pip, WTForms version 3.1.0 is fetched, which is incompatible.

Setup Superset locally using [these instructions](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-from-scratch).\r\n2. Start the development web server on port 8088.\r\n3. Visit [http://localhost:8088/users/list/)](http://localhost:8088/users/list/). The aforementioned error should be present when you check the logs in terminal.\r\n4. Uninstall WTForms (`pip uninstall wtforms`) and reinstall the compatible version (`pip install wtforms==3.0.1`). The error should no longer be present when you navigate to the /users endpoint\r\n\r\nAdditional Observation:\r\nPost this update, a UI issue was observed when I ran `pip install .` instead of `pip install apache-superset` as per the documentation. However, this seems unrelated to the changes in setup.py since it persists even when reverting to the original state and running the same command. Any insights into this would be appreciated. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

compatibility to the new [marshmallow errors](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25303) for the dataset editor when the errors are not SIP40 compliant. \r\nI also created a new default value that we can pass to new registries and used the default error message for the error message registry. \r\nLastly I also converted some tests to RTL. \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

build` I would get this error:\r\n```\r\nthrow new Error(\"You must provide the URL of lib/mappings.wasm by calling \" +\r\n            ^\r\n\r\nError: You must provide the URL of lib/mappings.wasm by

found a helpful note in the docs:\r\n\r\n> If this type of error comes while building assets(i.e using above commands):\r\n> \r\n> ```bash\r\n> Error: You must provide the URL of lib/mappings.wasm by calling SourceMapConsumer.initialize\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Then put this:\r\n> \r\n> ```bash\r\n> export NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-fetch\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n~~I'm _assuming_ that nobody _needs_ the `experimental-fetch` option enabled, so rather than letting users hit this error and go looking for the fix, let's just add the fix to the webpack build scripts in `package.json`~~\r\n\r\nUpdated approach! Upon fiddling with things, it seems that simply _installing_ the `source-map` dependency seems to automagically provide the missing `mappings.wasm` file, and we no longer have a problem.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24009\r\n\r\nSQL Lab throws an error for undefined parameters even when those parameters are commented out of/not used by the query.\r\nTemplate validation within comments is unnecessary because [comments are cleared](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/17792a507c7245c9e09c6eb98a774f2ef4ec8568/superset/sql_lab.py#L407)  when SQL is executed.\r\nThis commit passes parsed_query to the template validation that can ignore the missing parameter validation error within comments.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\nThe issue here is that the “isMetric” key for percentage metric is coming up as False from the columns when it is being imported from props. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/4ca6069a-ac0f-4d4c-bde7-15fe3c106581)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we follow the data into the line where we are creating “const valueRange”, we can see that we are calling the getValueRange function only when either “isMetric” is True or “isRawRecords” is true.  “isRawRecords” is false for both, and “isMetric” is only true for regular metrics and not percentage metrics. So the \"getValueRange\" function is not even being called for percentage metrics which is why it is not calculated for these metrics.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/6600007e-5974-4cc9-a36e-e6abb3a1e0ce)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we follow the data further, we can see in the “<StyledCell>” component where we are returning the Cell Bars we have a condition of “valueRange” to not be null in order to display the cell bars. We can verify with console.logs that the valueRange is never calculated in the case of percentage metrics and it is null. This is why the cell bars are not showing up for only the percentage metrics because the css class for it is not being added since “valueRange” is null.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/b941ad70-718b-4c08-8e3c-81e70a774bc9)\r\n\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\n\r\nA solution that fixed the cell bars for me is adding a separate `key[0] == “%”` in the conditional where we are checking `(isMetric || isRawRecords)` while creating the `const “valueRange”` variable. This ensures none of the other code is messed with and the cell bars still show up.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/0df46241-b789-41bc-9f3e-42da97e222ab)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can also make the isMetric variable true from the file where the percentage metric props are being created, but I am not sure if that might break other parts of the code, so this seemed to be the least intrusive way to fix it.\r\n\r\nEnd result:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/26e9970b-1bfb-4a85-9155-bcb8ed8a6a05)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/90512504/be0af2eb-2762-4cc9-8434-a273e52866de)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate a table chart and add both regular metrics and percentage metrics and enable the show cell bars options. They both should be showing when it previously was not.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nFixes #24495 - Show Cell Bars does not work on the Percentage Metrics in Table Chart\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing by #12188 \r\nThe current behavior always strips comments from the original SQL, which I believe helps to distinguish the last SELECT statement including comments in the end.\r\nAt Airbnb, we wants to execute the original SQL without stripping comments in order to process an additional behavior using a custom comment block.\r\nIn order to satisfy both cases, this commit enables executing original sql only for the single statements.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nRun `SELECT 1 --comment` and check the executed sql\r\n\r\nadded unit tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow

SUMMARY\r\nFixes the addressed issue (no. 6) on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25151#issuecomment-1747279563\r\n\r\nSince the #25151 replaces the SupersetClient.postForm by the router navigation, it loses the way to open the sql link in the new browser tab.\r\nThis commit recovers the way of opening sql in the new browser tab forcefully (when opening the link with the command/window key pressed).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nGo to Explore and open the control menu\r\nClick the Open in SQL Lab link with the cmd key (cmd + click/win + click)\r\nThe editor with the populated sql will be opened in the new browser tab\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR is created for adding database and schema names to the dataset option in the chart creation page and dashboard filter modal as described in Discussion: #25545. \r\n\r\nThe changes I have made will add database and schema names beneath each dataset name in the drop down list, as well as in the tooltip, so that users can identify the database and schema from which each dataset is created.\r\n\r\nFor datasets with a null schema name, the schema name in the tooltip label will be displayed as ‘Not defined’ instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n#### BEFORE<br>\r\n_Chart creation page_\r\n<br><img width=\"827\"
