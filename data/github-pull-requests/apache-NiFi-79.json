information for this tool is below and is also included in the PR here:\r\nhttps://github.com/YolandaMDavis/nifi/blob/f347869ceefd65d570fa5f9ab6d8daa6db2f4b57/nifi-docs/src/main/asciidoc/administration-guide.adoc\r\n\r\n**File Manager**\r\n\r\nThe File Manager utility allows system administrators to take a backup of an existing NiFi installation, install a new version of NiFi\r\nin a designated location (while migrating any previous configuration settings) or restore an installation from a previous backup.\r\nFile Manager supports NiFi version 1.0.0 and higher and is available in 'file-manager.bat' file for use on Windows machines.\r\n\r\nTo show help:\r\n\r\n  file-manager.sh -h\r\n\r\nThe following are available options:\r\n\r\n* `-o,--operation <arg>` File operation (install | backup | restore)\r\n* `-b,--backupDir <arg>` Backup NiFi Directory (used with backup or restore operation)\r\n* `-c,--nifiCurrentDir <arg>` Current NiFi Installation Directory (used optionally with install or restore operation)\r\n* `-d,--nifiInstallDir <arg>` NiFi Installation Directory (used with install or restore operation)\r\n* `-i,--installFile <arg>` NiFi Install File (used with install operation)\r\n* `-r,--nifiRollbackDir <arg>` NiFi Installation Directory (used with install or restore operation)\r\n* `-t,--bootstrapConf <arg>` Current NiFi Bootstrap Configuration File (used optionally)\r\n* `-m,--moveRepositories` Allow repositories to be moved to new/restored nifi directory from existing installation, if available (used optionally with install or restore operation)\r\n* `-x,--overwriteConfigs` Overwrite existing configuration directory with upgrade changes (used optionally with install or restore operation)\r\n* `-v,--verbose` Verbose messaging (optional)\r\n* `-h,--help` Print help info (optional)\r\n\r\nExample usage on Linux:\r\n\r\n```\r\n ./file-manager.sh\r\n -o backup\r\n –b /tmp/nifi_bak\r\n –c /usr/nifi_old\r\n -v\r\n```\r\n- backup NiFi installation \r\n- option -t may be provided to ensure backup of external boostrap.conf file\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n./file-manager.sh\r\n -o install\r\n –i nifi-1.3.0.tar.gz\r\n –d /usr/nifi\r\n –c /usr/nifi/nifi_old\r\n -t /usr/nifi/old_conf/bootstrap.conf\r\n -v\r\n -m\r\n```\r\n- install NiFi using compressed tar file into /usr/nifi directory (should install as /usr/nifi/nifi-1.3.0).\r\n- migrate existing configurations with location determined by external bootstrap.conf and move over repositories from nifi_old\r\n- options -t and -c should both be provided if migration of configurations, state and repositories are required\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n ./file-manager.sh\r\n -o restore\r\n –b /tmp/nifi_bak\r\n –r /usr/nifi_old\r\n –c /usr/nifi\r\n -m\r\n -v\r\n```\r\n- restore NiFi installation from backup directory and move back repositories\r\n- option -t may be provided to ensure bootstrap.conf is restored to the file path provided, otherwise it is placed in the\r\n- default directory under the rollback path (e.g. /usr/nifi_old/conf)\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior\r\n\r\nBackup:\r\n\r\nDuring the backup operation a backup directory is created in a designated location for an existing NiFi installation. Backups will capture all critical files\r\n(including any internal or external configurations, libraries, scripts and documents) however it excludes backing up repositories and logs due to potential size.\r\nIf configuration/library files are external from the existing installation folder the backup operation will capture those as well.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\nDuring the install operation File Manager will perform installation using the designated NiFi binary file (either tar.gz or zip file)\r\nto create a new installation or migrate an existing nifi installation to a new one.  Installation can optionally move repositories (if located within the configuration\r\nfolder of the current installation) to the new installation as well as migrate configuration files to the newer installation.\r\n\r\nRestore:\r\n\r\nThe restore operation allows an existing installation to revert back to a previous installation.  Using an existing backup directory (created from the backup operation)\r\nthe FileManager utility will restore libraries, scripts and documents as well as revert to previous configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
