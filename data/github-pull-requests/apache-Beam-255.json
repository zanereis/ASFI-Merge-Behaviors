It is formulated to preserve `git praise` for the files that are on their way to `runners-core`. Intermediate states are not expected to build or make sense, but the entire PR is intended and expected to be fully backwards-compatible.\n\nThe game plan is this:\n1. Add `TriggerReactor` and support classes to `runners-core`. These are the state machines that implement triggers.\n2. Add sufficient accessors (currently lacking) to `Trigger` so that it can be transformed into the corresponding `TriggerReactor`, making each `Trigger` class hold its data as as POJO and also have a visitor-style pattern matching as though it were a proper disjoint union.\n3. Port everything that uses triggers to treat `Trigger` as a syntax-tree POJO.\n4. Delete the now-obsolete non-syntax-tree methods from `Trigger`.\n","created_at":"2016-10-12T04:54:04Z","updated_at":"2021-10-27T23:31:31Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T22:22:50Z","merged_at":"2016-10-13T22:22:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"a64acb2f84ac26bd1a3f297085477f13b0252570","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/a64acb2f84ac26bd1a3f297085477f13b0252570","head":{"label":"kennknowles:TriggerReactor","ref":"TriggerReactor","sha":"a64acb2f84ac26bd1a3f297085477f13b0252570","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

reader should set consumedOffset even before reading the first record. This matters in cases where one of the partition might not have any records since the start. Without this fix, when the job is 'updated' (in Spark runner this happens frequently for each micro batch), the reader for such a partition could lose messages that are sent during the update.\n\nAnother option discussed is fetching these offsets insider `generateInitialSplits()` for better consistency. I don't think we need to do that yet : \n-  I don't it provides better consistency. AFIK, there is no concept of 'consistent set of offsets' across different partitions. \n- Increases start up latency.\n- If we are starting a streaming job from scratch (and using default 'latest offset'), expectation on 'starting point' is fuzzy anyway. \n- This policy does not matter for updates as the offset comes from checkpoint stored.\n- readers will take even more responsibility of managing splits when we add support for handing change in Kafka partitions. This does not help there. \n\nR: @amitsela, @dhalperi \n\nTODO:\n- [x] Add a unit test.\n\nBe sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`.

[ ] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThis is an alternative to #1044, based on lessons learned there. Instead of moving the disjoint union destruction to `StateSpec` and rebuilding `StateTag` = `StateSpec` + ID I have instead written `StateSpec` = `StateTag` - ID :-)\n\nI tend to think that `StateSpec` \"should\" be an independent thing, but that would mean the ability to `bind` it to a state cell without providing an ID. Given current design considerations, I don't think that fits as well. So instead, this PR just embraces the fact that a `StateSpec` has no real independent meaning, but is just a curried form of `StateTag` for use in the proposed state API.\n\nI'm curious if you have a preference.\n\nR: @bjchambers AND @tgroh AND @aljoscha

(Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThis allows any runner to use `DoFnInvokers.invokerFor(Object)` to be agnostic as to whether they are running a `DoFn` or `OldDoFn`. Thus, the migration of the runner can occur in advance of further changes to the SDK and deployment can be independent. For example, a backend need not know whether it is deserializing a `DoFn` or `OldDoFn`.\n","created_at":"2016-10-04T22:13:44Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T03:04:38Z","closed_at":"2016-10-07T03:18:54Z","merged_at":"2016-10-07T03:18:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"e2a24f3c2668c7341b38cc56d331cefd3a69f27f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1049/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1049/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1049/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/e2a24f3c2668c7341b38cc56d331cefd3a69f27f","head":{"label":"kennknowles:DoFnInvokers","ref":"DoFnInvokers","sha":"e2a24f3c2668c7341b38cc56d331cefd3a69f27f","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nR: @aljoscha AND @tgroh AND @bjchambers \n\nThis is a rebase and minor cleanup of #793.\n\nExecutive summary of `StateSpec` vs `StateTag`: The `StateSpec` doesn't include the identifier; it is basically a type. A `StateTag` is precisely a `StateSpec` plus an identifier, aka a full declaration. In the new proposed State API from https://s.apache.org/beam-state you have declarations like this:\n\n``` java\n  StateId(\"my-bag-id\")\n  private StateSpec<K, CombiningState<String, Iterable<String>>> bagCell =\n      StateSpecs.bagState(StringUtf8Coder.of())\n\n  @ProcessElement\n  public void process(\n    ProcessContext c,\n    @State(\"my-bag-id\") CombiningState<String, Iterable<String>> bag) { \n      ...\n  }\n```\n\nOther than supporting this style of declaration, there isn't much to `StateSpec`. The reason the `bind` method is moved to `StateSpec` is because now that is where the disjoint union lies, hence where the visitor / pattern matching has to occur.\n","created_at":"2016-10-04T18:53:17Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T03:04:44Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T17:19:00Z","merged_at":"2016-10-12T17:19:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c1ba2e1062556ac98b29f5bb4f5b75a7e7832e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1044/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1044/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1044/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/7c1ba2e1062556ac98b29f5bb4f5b75a7e7832e2","head":{"label":"kennknowles:StateSpec","ref":"StateSpec","sha":"7c1ba2e1062556ac98b29f5bb4f5b75a7e7832e2","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

(Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nPipelineOptions generates display data for arbitrary option types\nusing #toString(). For array types, this gives an message like\n[Ljava.lang.String;@fc25934b]. Instead, we detect array types\nand use Arrays.deepString to build a string based on array values.\n","created_at":"2016-09-30T17:07:25Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T20:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-10-03T16:08:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1027548f9c6086b2f1a09e52dbb041cdca7107fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/1236fad91ab7bfd00611d8d28680ef557455e5fc","head":{"label":"swegner:displaydata-array-string","ref":"displaydata-array-string","sha":"1236fad91ab7bfd00611d8d28680ef557455e5fc","user":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52832170,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjgzMjE3MA==","name":"beam","full_name":"swegner/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swegner/beam","description":"Mirror

this adds customizable file-based output support through DecoratedFileSink and concrete Gzip file-based output support through WriterOutputGzipDecoratorFactory.  I realize that the test coverage might be a little light for Apache Beam standards and have no problem expanding that if needed.\n\nThe DecoratedFileSink class provides a hook for decorating/transforming data output at the WritableByteChannel/OutputStream level to enable things like Gzip compression during shard file writes. I included a concrete implementation, WriterOutputGzipDecoratorFactory, of the hook interface, which enables Gzip output, and is currently in use by us at Bombora. My thinking was that a hook at this level would enable any file level transformation that could be done via wrapping an OutputStream (as opposed to field or record level handled elsewhere in the existing API).\n\nP.S.

have added a check so that the setup fails if pip <= 0.7.0 is not installed. \n\nIn addition, I have added cython as an optional dependency, so that it's installed only if the user decides to do so, e.g., via \n\n`pip install -e .[cython]`\n\nThe Readme file has also been updated, although I think that it may need some refactoring in the future, when/if the project is packaged and deployed on pypi as apache-beam. In that case, it would be possible to execute something like:\n\n`pip install apache-beam[cython]`\n\n---\n\nBe sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [X] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [ ] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`.

To allow testing DoFn reuse, adds a third cloning mode - CLONE_ONCE. The current CLONE is renamed to CLONE_PER_BUNDLE because it corresponds to the olden ways of DoFnTester. This rename should be harmless because it was the default, so probably nobody uses it (nobody uses it in the Beam codebase anyway), but I can rename it back if necessary.\n- Calls Setup lazily on the first interaction with the fn under test: depending on cloning mode, this is either a per-bundle clone, or the original fn, or a single clone of the original fn.\n- Calls Teardown either when the DoFnTester is closed, or when finishBundle'ing with CLONE_PER_BUNDLE.\n- Enforces that you have to configure the DoFnTester (setSideInputs, setCloningBehavior) before using it, to simplify the semantics. Makes setSideInputs consistent with setSideInput(without \"s\") in not resetting the state.\n- Allows processing a bundle after processing an element. This used to be disallowed, but it's weird, because processing a bundle after processing a bundle _was_ allowed.\n\nAdditionally, improves testing
