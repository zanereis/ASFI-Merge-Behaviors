currently leaves a lot to be desired when working with polymorphic datastructures.\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n```java\r\ninterface TextMatchingService {\r\n  sealed interface Status {\r\n    record NotSubmitted(Runnable submit) implements Status {}\r\n    record Queued(Instant since, Optional<Instant> expectedFinish) implements Status {}\r\n    record Analysed(float percentMatch) implements Status {}\r\n    record Error(int errorCode, String humanReadableMessage) implements Status {}\r\n  }\r\n  Status getStatus(File file);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow I want to have a panel that gets the status of a file and then, depending on the status, shows the different cases.\r\n\r\nIf I were to unpack the model and `switch` over the type in the constructor, when the value returned by the `IModel<Status>` changes due to the asynchronous nature of the text matching the hierarchy would be out of sync.\r\n\r\nThe proposed `poly` function would enable the following pattern for dealing with this case.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class TextMatchingPanel extends GenericPanel<File> {\r\n  @Inject\r\n  TextMatchingService textMatchingService;\r\n\r\n  public TextMatchingPanel(String id, IModel<File> fileModel) {\r\n    super(id, fileModel);\r\n    IModel<Status> statusModel = fileModel.map(textMatchingService::getStatus);\r\n    \r\n    add(new NotSubmittedPanel(\"not_submitted\", statusModel.poly(NotSubmitted.class));\r\n    [add more specific status panels]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  class NotSubmittedPanel extends Panel {\r\n    NotSubmittedPanel(String id, IModel<NotSubmitted> notSubmittedModel) {\r\n      super(id, notSubmittedModel);\r\n      add(new Link<>(\"submit\") {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onClick() {\r\n          NotSubmitted notSubmitted = notSubmittedModel.getObject();\r\n          Runnable submitForTextMatching = notSubmitted.submit();\r\n          submitForTextMatching.run();\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void onConfigure() {\r\n      super.onConfigure();\r\n      setVisible(getDefaultModelObject() != null);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  [more status panels]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there's a better way to do this, preferably using switch expressions (to get totality checking), that would be preferred but I've yet to come up with one.\r\n\r\nUnpacking in the constructor and creating different component hierarchies would work if the page was stateless but then there would also be no need for a detachable `IModel` since nothing gets serialized.","created_at":"2023-10-19T17:32:26Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T08:18:39Z","closed_at":"2023-10-23T08:18:38Z","merged_at":"2023-10-23T08:18:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b54fda399cf5e38c7ee745e1016d8ef363b44b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/pulls/684/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/pulls/684/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/684/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/statuses/9865daecc3f5ed32369d628ef50269f1dd981779","head":{"label":"asvanberg:poly-model","ref":"poly-model","sha":"9865daecc3f5ed32369d628ef50269f1dd981779","user":{"login":"asvanberg","id":4140285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDAyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4140285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg","html_url":"https://github.com/asvanberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440710524,"node_id":"R_kgDOGkS1fA","name":"wicket","full_name":"asvanberg/wicket","private":false,"owner":{"login":"asvanberg","id":4140285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDAyODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4140285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg","html_url":"https://github.com/asvanberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asvanberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/asvanberg/wicket","description":"Apache

Note that using a newer JDK version to run javac during the build doesn't prevent building code that is deployed to earlier versions, for example it's supported to use the JDK 17 javac and pass <code>--release 11</code> to compile Java 11 code that is deployed to a JDK 11 runtime.

This change reduces the number of false positive warnings in code that uses type variables but not resources.  However, it makes some code that uses type variables and resources unverifiable with any annotation.</p>\n<p><strong>Implementation details:</strong></p>\n<p>Deprecated <code>ElementUtils.getSimpleNameOrDescription()</code> in favor of <code>getSimpleDescription()</code>.</p>\n<p>Renamed methods in <code>AnnotatedTypeMirror</code>.\nThe old versions are deprecated.

acceptable they are in practice.\r\n\r\nThe first smell is when inappropriate assertions are used, while there exist better alternatives. For example, in [throws Exception using assertThrows](https://github.com/apache/wicket/commit/d667bafbb8081b87fc6dc764f7fc895b066b96d7), I refactored `assertTrue(img.getName().equals(\"img\"));` using `assertEquals(img.getName(), \"img\");`.\r\n\r\nThe second smell is when exception handling can alternatively be implemented using assertion rather than annotation. For example, in [ApplicationSettingsTest.java](https://github.com/apache/wicket/commit/d667bafbb8081b87fc6dc764f7fc895b066b96d7#diff-33c5fca8a9e134cb8422f5a47c446cc03ecdb043fcc8c70a780ee69c0aba789e), I used `assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> {...});` instead of `throws Exception`.\r\n\r\nWhile there could be several cases like this, we aim in this pull request to get your feedback on these particular test smells and their refactorings. Thanks in advance for your input.","created_at":"2023-08-24T01:05:39Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T07:55:48Z","closed_at":"2023-08-24T07:52:31Z","merged_at":"2023-08-24T07:52:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"3928c386259c2df4d0837838c87b57974051ff44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/pulls/601/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/pulls/601/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/601/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/statuses/97c65aa2e7a6da49b4077f24c6ec5f392c972108","head":{"label":"Taher-Ghaleb:master","ref":"master","sha":"97c65aa2e7a6da49b4077f24c6ec5f392c972108","user":{"login":"Taher-Ghaleb","id":25190974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTkwOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25190974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb","html_url":"https://github.com/Taher-Ghaleb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":681902393,"node_id":"R_kgDOKKUBOQ","name":"wicket","full_name":"Taher-Ghaleb/wicket","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Taher-Ghaleb","id":25190974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTkwOTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25190974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb","html_url":"https://github.com/Taher-Ghaleb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taher-Ghaleb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Taher-Ghaleb/wicket","description":"Apache
