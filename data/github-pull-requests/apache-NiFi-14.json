Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12768](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12768) Removes an unstable filename assertion from the `TestListFile.testFilterAge()` method.\r\n\r\nThe test method uses calculated timestamps to update multiple files and then runs the `ListFile` Processor to return a filtered number of files. The `testFilterAge()` method fails intermittently when checking for which file matched, but the previous assertion succeeds, confirming that only one file matched the filter.\r\n\r\nThis change is intentionally narrow, so additional changes may be necessary to revisit the larger file modification time approach if this continues to be a problem.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12764](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12764) Removes `commons-codec` and `commons-lang3` dependencies from `nifi-security-utils` to reduce the transitive dependencies inherited in other referencing modules.\r\n\r\nChanges include replacing Commons Codec Hex with Java [HexFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HexFormat.html) and replacing `StringUtils` references with simple checks.\r\n\r\nCommons Codec is a runtime dependency of OpenSAML, so it is now declared explicitly in `nifi-web-security`, and Commons Lang3 is a runtime dependency of the `nifi-system-test-suite` for dynamic class loading tests.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###

In this case, only the structure of the CSV will validated, using the header to determine how many fields each line should have. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, a new validation strategy was implemented, Validate on Attribute. This works similar to the way ValidateXML works in which the value of a given attribute of a FlowFile will be treated as the contents of a CSV file. Validation will be done on that attribute and not on the content of the FlowFile.\r\n\r\nI would also like to note that I made the stream a variable that can be assigned to either the FlowFile content or the value of the attribute. In doing this, I removed the need for an inner method, and thus all of the variables that previously needed to be Atomic References could now be regular variables. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

This will allow\r\nuser to unzip files with specific encoding to get correct filenames in output.\r\n\r\nThis for example help with zip files created on Windows which by default uses Cp437 for filename encoding.\r\nIf the filename contains special character like German alphabet ä, ü etc., decoding this with Linux's\r\ndefault encoding (usually UTF8) will contain `?` in output. When the same file is processed with property\r\nset with `Cp437`, the processor outputs correct filenames with special characters preserved.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

flush mode (unbatched flush)\r\n\r\n- Introduced `PutKuduResult` to store results of processing FlowFiles in PutKudu. \r\n- Introduced two implementations for `PutKuduResult`, namely `AutoFlushSyncPutKuduResult` and `StandardPutKuduResult`. `AutoFlushSyncPutKuduResult` includes optimizations considering it's an un-batched flush. `StandardPutKuduResult` encapsulates all the logic that was used to store the results for processing `FlowFiles` in the existing implementation.\r\n- Refactored `AbstractKuduProcessor` to separate out the `closeKuduSession` and `flushKuduSession` functionality.\r\n- Refactored `PutKudu` to utilize the new `PutKuduResult` class.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license

PR adds a dark mode theme for the app. It also restores these darker accent color from nifi 1.x for the draggable icons, nifi-buttons, etc. in the light mode. Dark mode is provided for both the default nifi theme as well as the purple theme. \r\n\r\nTo Test run dev mode `npm run start`. The header now contains a slide toggle which will toggle light/dark mode. We will need to determine how to persist the users state (or possibly use the OS settings).\r\n\r\nTo change the theme open the `nifi-web-fronted/pom.xml` and update the theme to 'purple' by setting the `frontend.theme` maven variable to:\r\n\r\n`<frontend.theme>purple</frontend.theme>`\r\n\r\nThen run a full build with:\r\n\r\n`mvn -T 2 install -DskipTests -Pinclude-new-ui`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, run a full build with:\r\n\r\n`mvn -T 2 install -DskipTests -Dfrontend.theme=purple -Pinclude-new-ui`\r\n\r\nand visit https://localhost:8443/nf/# to see the new purple theme! Now toggle to see dark mode! Sweetness!!!\r\n\r\nThe theme may also be changed outside of a full build in order to support fast developer cycles when designing a new theme. To do so `npm run start` and visit the new UI. Notice that the original NiFi theme is still applied even though we built with the 'purple' theme above. This is because the angular dev server is running in the src/ not in the target/ so in this location the 'purple' theme file has not overwritten the 'nifi' theme file. Now, to change to the 'purple' theme in `nifi-web-frontend/src/main/nifi/src/styles.scss` edit line #75 from:\r\n\r\n`@import 'assets/themes/nifi';`\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n`@import 'assets/themes/purple';`\r\n\r\nor if you have created your own theme file you could include that and see your custom theme applied.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-30T20:57:55Z","updated_at":"2024-02-01T21:59:43Z","closed_at":"2024-02-01T21:59:43Z","merged_at":"2024-02-01T21:59:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6f1d771e8af96453382e6f7e1cbef0280f153ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6268187900,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAanjsM8AAAABdZz0_A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/new%20ui","name":"new
