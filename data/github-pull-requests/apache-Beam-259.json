adds custom Kinesis source as new beam-sdks-java-io-kinesis module.\nBuild on Travis has passed.\n\nThis has been tested with unit tests (included in the pull request), but also using DirectRunner (I've confirmed, that source is able to successfully read data produced by Kinesis Producer Library). I've also tried to run this on real dataflow, but it doesn't seem to work (the pipeline starts, but it doesn't read anything at all) - I'm going to investigate the issue, but I'd like you to do the review in the meantime.\nSpeaking about tests... I've got bunch of integration / end-to-end level tests (using DirectRunner and DataflowRunner), which are using real kinesis to read data from. I'm not sure where should I put them and how would they be executed in apache CI environment?\n\nBTW. Is this \"large\" enough, so that I should sign ICLA?\n\n@dhalperi, @jbonofre - can you please review

functions and test harnesses for checking correctness of source (`iobase.BoundedSource`) and range tracker (`iobase.RangeTracker`) implementations.\n\nContains a few lightweight utilities (e.g. reading items from a source such as `readFromSource()`, as well as heavyweight property testing and stress testing harnesses that help getting a large amount of test\ncoverage with few code.\n\nMost notable ones are:\n- `assertSourcesEqualReferenceSource()` helps testing that the data read by the union of sources   produced by `BoundedSource.split()` is the same as data read by the original source.\n- If your source implements dynamic work rebalancing, use the `assertSplitAtFraction()` family of functions - they test behavior of `RangeTracker.try_split()`, in particular, that various consistency properties are respected and the total set of data read by the source is preserved when splits happen. \n  Use `assertSplitAtFractionBehavior()` to test individual cases of dynamic work rebalancing and use `assertSplitAtFractionExhaustive()` as a heavy-weight stress test including concurrency.\n\nUpdates 'avroio_test.py' to use the test framework.\n","created_at":"2016-07-15T18:17:18Z","updated_at":"2016-07-19T17:36:42Z","closed_at":"2016-07-19T17:36:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c712b98d86bbccd3a6b4e1db0089614dcb8ce178","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/214c5bc6257ebf302ef10cda34e73edaae128688","head":{"label":"chamikaramj:testingframework_l","ref":"testingframework_l","sha":"214c5bc6257ebf302ef10cda34e73edaae128688","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61584074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTU4NDA3NA==","name":"beam","full_name":"chamikaramj/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj/beam","description":"Mirror

is a json-schema sketch of the concrete schema from the [Pipeline Runner API proposal document](https://s.apache.org/beam-runner-api). Because our [serialization tech discussion](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/beam-dev/201606.mbox/%3CCAN_Ypr2ZPQG3OgPWu==kF-zztG06k0v5i0AY3DABCHJyvEr9pA@mail.gmail.com%3E) seemed to favor JSON on the front end and Proto on the backend, I made this quick port. The original Avro IDL definition is also on [a branch with a test](https://github.com/kennknowles/incubator-beam/blob/pipeline-model/model/pipeline/src/main/avro/org/apache/beam/model/pipeline/pipeline.avdl).\n\nNotes & Caveats:\n- I did not try to flesh out any more details; this was a straight port. There's plenty to add, but a PR seems like a place that will attract a desired kind of concrete discussion even in the current state.\n- Typing this makes my hands hurt. Luckily, it should change exceedingly rarely. There are many libraries that can generate json-schema in various ways, including Jackson itself, but I'm not so sure any of them are applicable.\n- Reading this makes my eyes hurt. This is a real problem. We need a readable spec, not just a test suite for validation.\n- I am not so sure that [the schema library](https://github.com/daveclayton/json-schema-validator) I've used to build my smoke test is a good long term choice. I chose it because it was Jackson-based.\n- I've left comments in the JSON even though that is frowned upon, and taken advantage of Jackson's feature to allow them. They can also go into `\"description\"` fields.\n- Perhaps we could write YAML and convert to json-schema with no loss of precision?\n\nFeel free to leave comments here about the schema or meta issues of e.g. where the schema should live and what libraries we might want to use.\n","created_at":"2016-07-15T04:16:59Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T23:55:45Z","closed_at":"2017-02-21T17:08:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20f7a2a123a1cccf1a65790a05437cb5690e7781","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/662/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/662/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/662/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c5843ce10e782056c76157169eb5516bf18ed9e4","head":{"label":"kennknowles:pipeline-json-schema","ref":"pipeline-json-schema","sha":"c5843ce10e782056c76157169eb5516bf18ed9e4","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

using an `UnboundedFlinkSource` seems to force the timestamp applied to each element of the incoming stream to the ingestion time, rather than allowing for proper event timestamping. This PR  adds the ability to created an `UnboundedFlinkSource` with a custom TimestampAssigner, which should alleviate that issue. Note that this is particularly useful, as currently the only means of consuming from Kafka 0.8 using Beam/Flink Runner is to wrap Flink's Kafka 0.8 consumer.\n","created_at":"2016-07-11T21:11:44Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T10:16:12Z","closed_at":"2016-07-13T14:11:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d08749b148509c50d31b0db49c8b5a52030162ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/5d274e4ee5b5fc498bcabcab75bd7be30210bb3c","head":{"label":"daviddesberg:flink_event_time","ref":"flink_event_time","sha":"5d274e4ee5b5fc498bcabcab75bd7be30210bb3c","user":{"login":"daviddesberg","id":1907815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDc4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1907815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg","html_url":"https://github.com/daviddesberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63090755,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzA5MDc1NQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"daviddesberg/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"daviddesberg","id":1907815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDc4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1907815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg","html_url":"https://github.com/daviddesberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddesberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/daviddesberg/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

This meant that\nall the dependencies for all runners had to be resolvable in an\nintegration testing context. It is quite inconvenient.\n\nExplicitly excluding runners via flags such as `-pl !runners/spark`\ndoes not work since it causes errors in dependency resolution.\n\nThis change adds a profile, active

This change moves the tests to validate all runners.\n\nSpecifically, the changes are:\n1. Move test cases into respective transform unit test classes and apply `@RunnableOnService`\n2. Adapt tests as necessary to run on DirectRunner. This includes a real bug fix in `Combine.GroupedValues#apply()`.\n\nMany runners have not invested in display data support (Flink, Spark), and these tests may fail when run against them.
