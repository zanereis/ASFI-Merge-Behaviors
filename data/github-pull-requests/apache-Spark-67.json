What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to reduce the memory consumption of `LiveStageMetrics.accumIdsToMetricType`, which should help to reduce driver memory usage when running complex SQL queries that contain many operators and run many jobs.\r\n\r\nIn SQLAppStatusListener, the LiveStageMetrics.accumIdsToMetricType field holds a map which is used to look up the type of accumulators in order to perform conditional processing of a stage’s metrics.\r\n\r\nCurrently, that field is derived from `LiveExecutionData.metrics`, which contains metrics for _all_ operators used anywhere in the query. Whenever a job is submitted, we construct a fresh map containing all metrics that have ever been registered for that SQL query. If a query runs a single job, this isn't an issue: in that case, all `LiveStageMetrics` instances will hold the same immutable `accumIdsToMetricType`.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises if we have a query that runs many jobs (e.g. a complex query with many joins which gets divided into many jobs due to AQE): in that case, each job submission results in a new `accumIdsToMetricType` map being created.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by changing `accumIdsToMetricType` to be a mutable `mutable.HashMap` which is shared across all `LivestageMetrics` instances belonging to the same `LiveExecutionData`.\r\n\r\nThe modified classes are `private` and are used only in SQLAppStatusListener, so I don't think this change poses any realistic risk of binary incompatibility risks to third party code.   \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAddresses one contributing factor behind high driver memory / OOMs when executing complex queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate memory reduction, I performed manual benchmarking and heap dump inspection using benchmark that ran copies of a complex query: each test query launches ~200 jobs (so at least 200 stages) and contains ~3800 total operators, resulting in a huge number metric accumulators. Prior to this PR's fix, ~3700 LiveStageMetrics instances (from multiple concurrent runs of the query) consumed a combined ~3.3 GB of heap. After this PR's fix, I observed negligible memory usage from LiveStageMetrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-06T20:25:01Z","updated_at":"2023-10-14T07:28:30Z","closed_at":"2023-10-14T07:28:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb3502232bd878039ba6d2a9c4da55505cdfaf49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds in support for trust store reloading, mirroring the Hadoop implementation (see source comments for a link). I believe reusing the existing code instead of adding a dependency is fine license wise (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42685/files#r1333667328)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis helps us refresh trust stores without needing downtime\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests (also copied from upstream)\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt\r\n> project network-common\r\n> testOnly org.apache.spark.network.ssl.ReloadingX509TrustManagerSuite\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe rest of the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSome may want to use checkpoint to get a consistent snapshot of the Dataset / RDD. Warn that this is not the case with lazy checkpoint, because checkpoint is computed only at the end of the first action, and the data used during the first action may be different because of non-determinism and retries.\r\n\r\n`doCheckpoint` is only called at the end of [SparkContext.runJob](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5446f548bbc8a93414f1c773a8daf714b57b7d1a/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkContext.scala#L2426). This may cause recomputation both of data of [local checkpoint data](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5446f548bbc8a93414f1c773a8daf714b57b7d1a/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/LocalRDDCheckpointData.scala#L54) and [reliable checkpoint data](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5446f548bbc8a93414f1c773a8daf714b57b7d1a/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/ReliableCheckpointRDD.scala#L166) before it is finalized.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocument a gnarly edge case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, change to documentation of public APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDoc only change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-06T10:19:09Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T07:54:12Z","closed_at":"2024-01-15T06:55:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4290a0617587d9a9d3fd02f9c5b4f78526034d06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43247/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43247/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43247/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e9692513de550195cb4c5d27f1648bf2609f5125","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-45435-doc","ref":"SPARK-45435-doc","sha":"e9692513de550195cb4c5d27f1648bf2609f5125","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

If fact, `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` can parse `9999-12-31 23:59:59`  normally, but value have suffix `.999`. so we can't return not empty result.\r\nThis bug will affect inference the schema in CSV/JSON.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds helper classes for SSL RPC communication that are needed to work around the fact that `netty` does not support zero-copy transfers.\r\n\r\nThese mirror the existing `MessageWithHeader` and `MessageEncoder` classes with very minor differences. But the differences were just enough that it didn't seem easy to refactor/consolidate, and since we don't expect these classes to change much I hope it's ok.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese are needed to support transferring `ManagedBuffer`s into a form that can be transferred by `netty` over the network, since netty's encryption support does not support zero-copy transfers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt\r\n> project network-common\r\n>

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fix CSV/JSON schema inference when timestamps do not match specified timestampFormat will report error.\r\n```scala\r\n//eg\r\nval csv = spark.read.option(\"timestampFormat\", \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss\")\r\n  .option(\"inferSchema\", true).csv(Seq(\"2884-06-24T02:45:51.138\").toDS())\r\ncsv.show() \r\n//error\r\nCaused by: java.time.format.DateTimeParseException: Text '2884-06-24T02:45:51.138' could not be parsed, unparsed text found at index 19 \r\n```\r\nThis bug only happend when partition had one row. The data type should be `StringType` not `TimestampType` because the value not match `timestampFormat`.\r\n\r\nUse csv as eg, in `CSVInferSchema::tryParseTimestampNTZ`, first, use `timestampNTZFormatter.parseWithoutTimeZoneOptional` to inferring return `TimestampType`, if same partition had another row, it will use `tryParseTimestamp` to parse row with user defined `timestampFormat`, then found it can't be convert to timestamp with `timestampFormat`. Finally return `StringType`. But when only one row, we use `timestampNTZFormatter.parseWithoutTimeZoneOptional` to parse normally timestamp not right. We should only parse it when `spark.sql.timestampType` is `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`. If `spark.sql.timestampType` is `TIMESTAMP_LTZ`, we should directly parse it use `tryParseTimestamp`. To avoid return `TimestampType` when timestamps do not match specified timestampFormat.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to reduce the chance of GA test tasks being killed by decreasing the memory required to start `LocalClusterSparkContext`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe GA test task for mllib is sometimes killed, and the test cases to be tested that often get killed are those that inherit from `LocalClusterSparkContext`, such as\r\n\r\n- LBFGSClusterSuite: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/6421930285/job/17437383223\r\n- NaiveBayesClusterSuite: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/6436807001/job/17480899578\r\n- LassoClusterSuite: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/6362618008/job/17289887813\r\n- LBFGSClusterSuite: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/6346972272/job/17289897396\r\n\r\nSo this pr circumvents this issue by reducing the startup memory required for `LocalClusterSparkContext`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nShould monitor GA\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd some documentation to clarify the new flags being added and how this feature interacts with existing SSL and encryption support. It's a little confusing so feedback is welcome.\r\n\r\nNote I am not sure if it's best practice to merge this after the feature is fully merged - thought I would put this up now since it's unblocked.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNew features require documentation so users can understand how to use them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this is adding documentation for a new feature\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot applicable, this is documentation\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-06T03:04:18Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T03:17:23Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T03:16:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd9c3dd79ec074d3f5f56390d61c4daf7e3b10e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fa9ca554def370eed8942f4b16f39e2ead127aee","head":{"label":"hasnain-db:spark-tls-docs","ref":"spark-tls-docs","sha":"fa9ca554def370eed8942f4b16f39e2ead127aee","user":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677479521,"node_id":"R_kgDOKGGEYQ","name":"spark","full_name":"hasnain-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the options added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43220  to `SSLOptions` and `SparkTransportConf`.\r\n\r\nBy adding it to the `SSLOptions` we can support inheritance of options, so settings for the UI and RPC SSL settings can be shared as much as possible. The `SparkTransportConf` changes are needed to support propagating these settings.\r\n\r\nI also make some changes to `SecurityManager` to log when this feature is enabled, and make the existing `spark.network.crypto` options mutually exclusive with this new settings (it would just involve double encryption then).\r\n\r\nLastly, make these flags propagate down to when executors are launched, and allow the passwords to be sent via environment variables (similar to how it's done for an existing secret). This ensures they are not visible in plaintext, but also ensures they are available at executor startup (otherwise it can never talk to the driver/worker)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe propagation of these options are needed for the RPC functionality to work\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI\r\n\r\nAdded some unit tests which I verified passed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt\r\n> project core\r\n> testOnly org.apache.spark.SparkConfSuite org.apache.spark.SSLOptionsSuite org.apache.spark.SecurityManagerSuite org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.CommandUtilsSuite\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes and integration were tested as part of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42685\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-06T02:17:35Z","updated_at":"2023-10-14T07:36:58Z","closed_at":"2023-10-14T07:36:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc4cc399e36197a3184da1598f35636dbde00733","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd0801218a8c99c46f9c29ca5292a379483022ea","head":{"label":"hasnain-db:spark-tls-ssloptions","ref":"spark-tls-ssloptions","sha":"fd0801218a8c99c46f9c29ca5292a379483022ea","user":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677479521,"node_id":"R_kgDOKGGEYQ","name":"spark","full_name":"hasnain-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMapped TINYINT to `ShortType` for MsSqlServerDialect. For TINYINT of sql server, its range is `0-255`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTINYINT of SQL server is not correctly mapped to spark types when using JDBC connector. For now, it is mapped to the `IntegerType`, which is not accurate. It should be mapped to `ShortType`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the change, `TINYINT` of SQL server will be mapped to `ShortType`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-05T18:49:26Z","updated_at":"2023-10-07T03:45:35Z","closed_at":"2023-10-06T21:53:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1027ef597ba1349d04c9a90f15d65a141804fceb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43232/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43232/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43232/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b84f637c94c404e7833c061609637c78fd38f3ab","head":{"label":"zeruibao:SPARK-45425-map-tinyint","ref":"SPARK-45425-map-tinyint","sha":"b84f637c94c404e7833c061609637c78fd38f3ab","user":{"login":"zeruibao","id":125398515,"node_id":"U_kgDOB3lt8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125398515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao","html_url":"https://github.com/zeruibao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":636466287,"node_id":"R_kgDOJe-0bw","name":"spark","full_name":"zeruibao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zeruibao","id":125398515,"node_id":"U_kgDOB3lt8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125398515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao","html_url":"https://github.com/zeruibao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeruibao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zeruibao/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake `InheritableThread` and `inheritable_thread_target` inherit the active session.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSometimes the active session can be null in Python threads, even with `InheritableThread` or `inheritable_thread_target`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# repro.py\r\n# run as: bin/spark-submit repro.py\r\nfrom multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool\r\nfrom pyspark import inheritable_thread_target\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Test\").getOrCreate()\r\nspark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"ERROR\")\r\n\r\ndef f(i, spark):\r\n    print(f\"{i} spark = {spark}\")\r\n    print(f\"{i} active session = {SparkSession.getActiveSession()}\")\r\n    print(f\"{i} local property foo = {spark.sparkContext.getLocalProperty('foo')}\")\r\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Test\").getOrCreate()\r\n    print(f\"{i} spark = {spark}\")\r\n    print(f\"{i} active session = {SparkSession.getActiveSession()}\")\r\n\r\npool = ThreadPool(4)\r\nspark.sparkContext.setLocalProperty(\"foo\", \"bar\")\r\npool.starmap(inheritable_thread_target(f), [(i, spark) for i in range(4)])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. When using `InheritableThread` or `inheritable_thread_target`, the active session will be copied from the parent thread.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n`python/run-tests --testnames pyspark.tests.test_pin_thread`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-05T17:25:00Z","updated_at":"2024-03-02T00:17:19Z","closed_at":"2024-03-02T00:17:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8bb91134ef7aa1a7f270a98049b275b6d860c15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b64c026595686820baae8bfd968cd3772e4817ae","head":{"label":"clee704:fix-inheritable-active-session-master","ref":"fix-inheritable-active-session-master","sha":"b64c026595686820baae8bfd968cd3772e4817ae","user":{"login":"clee704","id":220039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDAzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704","html_url":"https://github.com/clee704","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":362404999,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjI0MDQ5OTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"clee704/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clee704","id":220039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDAzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704","html_url":"https://github.com/clee704","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee704/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clee704/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCorrects the docstring `DataFrame.cache` to give the correct storage level after it changed with Spark 3.0. It seems that the docstring of `DataFrame.persist` was updated, but `cache` was forgotten.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe doctoring claims that `cache` uses serialised storage, but it actually uses deserialised storage.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `DataType.fromDDL` as the parity to Scala API:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/350b8d8388c9ad15303d39f22b249b8c73785695/sql/api/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/types/DataType.scala#L121-L126\r\n\r\nOne difference is that Python API also supports the legacy format inside `struct<...>`, e.g., `a: int, b: int`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order for the end users to parse the DDL formatted type easily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR adds a new user-facing API: `DataType.fromDDL`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added, and manually tested them too.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a new API `cleanup` to the current Python UDTF interface.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the `terminate` method of a UDTF is always executed, regardless of whether the `eval` method calls are successful. This is problematic as users might have certain logic in `terminate` that can only be executed once all `eval` calls succeed.\r\n\r\nBut what if users wish to perform cleanup actions during UDTF execution, such as closing connections? One option is for users to embed a try...except logic within the eval call:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef eval(self, row: Any):\r\n  try:\r\n    run_code()\r\n  except Exception:\r\n    clean_up()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, running this try-except block for every eval call can be expensive, potentially affecting the performance of UDTFs.\r\n\r\nTo tackle this, we can introduce a new method in the UDTF interface that will be called regardless of the outcome. Now the logic would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry:\r\n  for row in rows:\r\n    eval(row)\r\n  terminate()\r\nfinally:\r\n  cleanup()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake `InheritableThread` and `inheritable_thread_target` inherit the active session.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSometimes the active session can be null in Python threads, even with `InheritableThread` or `inheritable_thread_target`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# repro.py\r\n# run as: bin/spark-submit repro.py\r\nfrom multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool\r\nfrom pyspark import inheritable_thread_target\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Test\").getOrCreate()\r\nspark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"ERROR\")\r\n\r\ndef f(i, spark):\r\n    print(f\"{i} spark = {spark}\")\r\n    print(f\"{i} active session = {SparkSession.getActiveSession()}\")\r\n    print(f\"{i} local property foo = {spark.sparkContext.getLocalProperty('foo')}\")\r\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Test\").getOrCreate()\r\n    print(f\"{i} spark = {spark}\")\r\n    print(f\"{i} active session = {SparkSession.getActiveSession()}\")\r\n\r\npool = ThreadPool(4)\r\nspark.sparkContext.setLocalProperty(\"foo\", \"bar\")\r\npool.starmap(inheritable_thread_target(f), [(i, spark) for i in range(4)])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. When using `InheritableThread` or `inheritable_thread_target`, the active session will be copied from the parent thread.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n`python/run-tests --testnames pyspark.tests.test_pin_thread`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSanity check that Arrow Batches in the results from Spark Connect contain the declared number of rows, and that they come from consecutive and contiguous offsets in query results.\r\n\r\nGetting this mixed up could lead to silent wrong results.\r\n\r\nConceptually, it can for example help avoid potential issues with reattachable execute caused by wrongly reattaching in the wrong place in the stream, and silently repeating, or omitting some results from the middle.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nProtection from hard to crack issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExercised by every query in existing coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Add retries to `add_artifact` api in client\r\n\r\n2. Slightly change control flow within `artifact.py` so that client-side errors (e.g. FileNotFound) are properly thrown. (Previously we attempted to add logs in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42949, but that was imperfect solution, this should be much better).\r\n\r\n3. Accept proper ownership over files in LocalData, and close those descriptors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproves user experience\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nImprove error handling, adds retries.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test coverage for add_artifact when there is no artifact.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport for InMememoryTableScanExec in AQE was added in #39624, but this patch contained a bug when a Dataset is persisted using `StorageLevel.NONE`. Before that patch a query like:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.storage.StorageLevel\r\nspark.createDataset(Seq(1, 2)).persist(StorageLevel.NONE).count()\r\n```\r\nwould correctly return 2. But after that patch it incorrectly returns 0. This is because AQE incorrectly determines based on the runtime statistics that are collected here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/eac5a8c7e6da94bb27e926fc9a681aed6582f7d3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/columnar/InMemoryRelation.scala#L294\r\nthat the input is empty. The problem is that the action that should make sure the statistics are collected here\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/eac5a8c7e6da94bb27e926fc9a681aed6582f7d3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/QueryStageExec.scala#L285-L291\r\nnever use the iterator and when we have `StorageLevel.NONE` the persisting will also not use the iterator and we will not gather the correct statistics.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix in the patch just make calling persist with StorageLevel.NONE a no-op. Changing the action since it always \"emptied\" the iterator would also work but seems like that would be unnecessary work in a lot of normal circumstances. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` in addition to the existing `AWS_*` environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve the usability. This is useful when we use S3-compatible object storages.\r\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/settings-reference.html#EVarSettings\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is a new feature. If a user have a misconfigured `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`, it will hang or mostly be denied during the authentication.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly updated test case.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-03T23:25:58Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T16:42:26Z","closed_at":"2023-10-04T16:40:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18d22314baaff208411136576998d84f8c163205","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43205/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43205/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43205/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e80459a2de3c613dd60c8ccc2880ebdfaba6675","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-45404","ref":"SPARK-45404","sha":"3e80459a2de3c613dd60c8ccc2880ebdfaba6675","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a Python UDTF API for the `eval` and `terminate` methods to consume the previous `analyze` result.\r\n\r\nThis also works for subclasses of the `AnalyzeResult` class, allowing the UDTF to return custom state from `analyze` to be consumed later.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can now define a UDTF that perform complex initialization in the `analyze` method and then returns the result of that in the `terminate` method:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef MyUDTF(self):\r\n    @dataclass\r\n    class AnalyzeResultWithBuffer(AnalyzeResult):\r\n        buffer: str\r\n\r\n    @udtf\r\n    class TestUDTF:\r\n        def __init__(self, analyze_result):\r\n            self._total = 0\r\n\t    self._buffer = do_complex_initialization(analyze_result.buffer)\r\n\r\n        @staticmethod\r\n        def analyze(argument, _):\r\n            return AnalyzeResultWithBuffer(\r\n                schema=StructType()\r\n\t\t    .add(\"total\", IntegerType())\r\n\t\t    .add(\"buffer\", StringType()),\r\n                with_single_partition=True,\r\n                buffer=argument.value,\r\n            )\r\n\r\n        def eval(self, argument, row: Row):\r\n            self._total += 1\r\n\r\n        def terminate(self):\r\n            yield self._total, self._buffer\r\n\r\nself.spark.udtf.register(\"my_ddtf\", MyUDTF)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the results might look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql(\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    WITH t AS (\r\n      SELECT id FROM range(1, 21)\r\n    )\r\n    SELECT total, buffer\r\n    FROM test_udtf(\"abc\", TABLE(t))\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n).collect()\r\n\r\n> 20, \"complex_initialization_result\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn this way, the UDTF can perform potentially expensive initialization logic in the `analyze` method just once and result the result of such initialization rather than repeating the initialization in `eval`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new unit test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-03T22:43:16Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T01:52:14Z","closed_at":"2023-10-12T01:52:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e271ebed0db21e3a86380419c57d1c0b36c51ef7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/edd4c21c84a5c4126e6b94a93f3be3bd60a6c099","head":{"label":"dtenedor:prepare-string","ref":"prepare-string","sha":"edd4c21c84a5c4126e6b94a93f3be3bd60a6c099","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOur spark environment features a number of parallel structured streaming jobs, many of which have use state store.  Most use state store for dropDuplicates and work with a tiny amount of information, but a few have a substantially large state store requiring use of RocksDB.  In such a configuration, spark allocates a minimum of `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions * queryCount` partitions, each of which pre-allocate about 74mb (observed on EMR/Hadoop) disk storage for RocksDB.  This allocation is due to pre-allocation of log files space using [fallocate](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/main/include/rocksdb/options.h#L871-L880), requiring users to either unnaturally reduce shuffle partitions, split running spark instances, or allocating a large amount of wasted storage.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides users with the option to simply disable fallocate so RocksDB uses far less space for the smaller state stores, reducing complexity and disk storage at the expense of performance.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue.\r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs previously mentioned, these changes allow a spark context to support many parallel structured streaming jobs when using RocksDB state stores without the need to allocate a glut of excess storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nUsers disable the fallocate rocksdb performance optimization by configuring `spark.sql.streaming.stateStore.rocksdb.allowFAllocate=false`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n1) A few test cases were added\r\n2) The state store size was validated by running this script with and without

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix the `sql()` method of the `Like` expression, and append the `ESCAPE` clause when the `escapeChar` is not the default one `\\\\`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To be consistent to the `toString()` method\r\n2. To distinguish column names when the escape argument is set. Before the changes, columns might conflict like the example below, and that could confuse users:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> create temp view tbl as (SELECT 'a|_' like 'a||_' escape '|', 'a|_' like 'a||_' escape 'a');\r\n[COLUMN_ALREADY_EXISTS] The column `a|_ like a||_` already exists. Consider to choose another name or rename the existing column.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually checking the column name by:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> create temp view tbl as (SELECT 'a|_' like 'a||_' escape '|', 'a|_' like 'a||_' escape 'a');\r\nTime taken: 0.531 seconds\r\nspark-sql (default)> describe extended tbl;\r\na|_ LIKE a||_ ESCAPE '|'\tboolean\r\na|_ LIKE a||_ ESCAPE 'a'\tboolean\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes shading for the Spark Connect Scala Client maven build. The following things are addressed:\r\n- Guava and protobuf are included in the shaded jars. These were missing, and were causing users to see `ClassNotFoundException`s.\r\n- Fixed duplicate shading of guava. We use the parent pom's location now.\r\n- Fixed duplicate Netty dependency (shaded and transitive). One was used for GRPC and the other was needed by Arrow. This was fixed by pulling arrow into the shaded jar.\r\n- Use the same package as the shading defined in the parent package.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe maven artifacts for the Spark Connect Scala Client are currently broken.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests.\r\n#### Step 1:  Build new shaded library and install it in local maven repository\r\n`build/mvn clean install -pl connector/connect/client/jvm -am -DskipTests`\r\n#### Step 2: Start Connect Server\r\n`connector/connect/bin/spark-connect`\r\n#### Step 3: Launch REPL using the newly created library\r\nThis step requires [coursier](https://get-coursier.io/) to be installed.\r\n`cs launch --jvm zulu:17.0.8 --scala 2.13.9 -r m2Local com.lihaoyi:::ammonite:2.5.11 org.apache.spark::spark-connect-client-jvm:4.0.0-SNAPSHOT --java-opt --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED -M org.apache.spark.sql.application.ConnectRepl`\r\n#### Step 4: Run a bunch of commands:\r\n```scala\r\n// Check version\r\nspark.version\r\n\r\n// Run a simple query\r\n{\r\n  spark.range(1, 10000, 1)\r\n    .select($\"id\", $\"id\" % 5 as \"group\", rand(1).as(\"v1\"), rand(2).as(\"v2\"))\r\n    .groupBy($\"group\")\r\n    .agg(\r\n      avg($\"v1\").as(\"v1_avg\"),\r\n      avg($\"v2\").as(\"v2_avg\"))\r\n    .show()\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Run a streaming query\r\n{\r\n  import org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.ProcessingTimeTrigger\r\n  val query_name = \"simple_streaming\"\r\n  val stream = spark.readStream\r\n    .format(\"rate\")\r\n    .option(\"numPartitions\", \"1\")\r\n    .option(\"rowsPerSecond\", \"10\")\r\n    .load()\r\n    .withWatermark(\"timestamp\", \"10 milliseconds\")\r\n    .groupBy(window(col(\"timestamp\"), \"10 milliseconds\"))\r\n    .count()\r\n    .selectExpr(\"window.start as timestamp\", \"count as num_events\")\r\n    .writeStream\r\n    .format(\"memory\")\r\n    .queryName(query_name)\r\n    .trigger(ProcessingTimeTrigger.create(\"10 milliseconds\"))\r\n  // run for 20 seconds\r\n  val query = stream.start()\r\n  val start = System.currentTimeMillis()\r\n  val end = System.currentTimeMillis() + 20 * 1000\r\n  while (System.currentTimeMillis() < end) {\r\n    println(s\"time: ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} ms\")\r\n    println(query.status)\r\n    spark.sql(s\"select * from ${query_name}\").show()\r\n    Thread.sleep(500)\r\n  }\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `distutils` usage from Spark codebase.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n$ git grep distutils | wc -l\r\n      38\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\n$ git grep distutils | wc -l\r\n       0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apache Spark ignores the warnings but the module itself is removed at Python 3.12 via [PEP-632](https://peps.python.org/pep-0632) in favor of `packaging` package.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/58c24a5719b8717ea37347c668c9df8a3714ae3c/python/pyspark/__init__.py#L54-L56\r\n\r\n Initially, #43184 proposed to follow Python community guideline via using `packaging` package, but, this PR is embedding `LooseVersion` Python class to avoid adding a new package requirement.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-01T01:45:03Z","updated_at":"2023-10-01T17:45:17Z","closed_at":"2023-10-01T17:45:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6f6ddf561e480c17a512d516b6a8b1743510a83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

Python language code sample in the docs for _StreamingQueryListener_:\r\nReporting Metrics programmatically using Asynchronous APIs section.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe code sample in the [Reporting Metrics programmatically using Asynchronous APIs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#reporting-metrics-programmatically-using-asynchronous-apis) section was this:\r\n```\r\nspark = ...\r\n\r\nclass Listener(StreamingQueryListener):\r\n    def onQueryStarted(self, event):\r\n        print(\"Query started: \" + queryStarted.id)\r\n\r\n    def onQueryProgress(self, event):\r\n        println(\"Query terminated: \" + queryTerminated.id)\r\n\r\n    def onQueryTerminated(self, event):\r\n        println(\"Query made progress: \" + queryProgress.progress)\r\n\r\n\r\nspark.streams.addListener(Listener())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is not a proper Python code, and has QueryProgress and QueryTerminated prints mixed. Proposed change/fix:\r\n```\r\nspark = ...\r\n\r\nclass Listener(StreamingQueryListener):\r\n    def onQueryStarted(self, event):\r\n        print(\"Query started: \" + queryStarted.id)\r\n\r\n    def onQueryProgress(self, event):\r\n        print(\"Query made progress: \" + queryProgress.progress)\r\n\r\n    def onQueryTerminated(self, event):\r\n        print(\"Query terminated: \" + queryTerminated.id)\r\n\r\n\r\nspark.streams.addListener(Listener())\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix docimentation errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. -> Sample python code snippet is fixed in docs (see above).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nChecked with github's .md preview, and built the docs according to the readme.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport for InMememoryTableScanExec in AQE was added in #39624, but this patch contained a bug when a Dataset is persisted using `StorageLevel.NONE`. Before that patch a query like:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.storage.StorageLevel\r\nspark.createDataset(Seq(1, 2)).persist(StorageLevel.NONE).count()\r\n```\r\nwould correctly return 2. But after that patch it incorrectly returns 0. This is because AQE incorrectly determines based on the runtime statistics that are collected here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/eac5a8c7e6da94bb27e926fc9a681aed6582f7d3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/columnar/InMemoryRelation.scala#L294\r\nthat the input is empty. The problem is that the action that should make sure the statistics are collected here\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/eac5a8c7e6da94bb27e926fc9a681aed6582f7d3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/QueryStageExec.scala#L285-L291\r\nnever use the iterator and when we have `StorageLevel.NONE` the persisting will also not use the iterator and we will not gather the correct statistics.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix in the patch just make calling persist with StorageLevel.NONE a no-op. Changing the action since it always \"emptied\" the iterator would also work but seems like that would be unnecessary work in a lot of normal circumstances. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to deprecate the SQL config `spark.sql.parser.escapedStringLiterals`, and put to the list of deprecated configs: `SQLConf.deprecatedSQLConfigs`. Also I modified a test to check that the recommendation in the deprecation comment works actually.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe config allows to switch to legacy behaviour of Spark 1.6 which is pretty old and not maintained anymore. Deprecation and removing of the config in the future versions should improve code maintenance. Also there is an alternative approach by using RAW string literals in which Spark doesn't especially handle escaped character sequences.\r\n\r\nAlso removing of the SQL config in the future should simplify functions/expressions description like `LIKE`, [link](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/#like).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DatasetSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to upgrade Scala from 2.13.11 to 2.13.12.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this pr adds ``-Wconf:msg=legacy-binding:s`` to suppress similar compiler warnings as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/client/StandaloneAppClient.scala:171: reference to stop is ambiguous;\r\nit is both defined in the enclosing class StandaloneAppClient and inherited in the enclosing class ClientEndpoint as method stop (defined in trait RpcEndpoint, inherited through parent trait ThreadSafeRpcEndpoint)\r\nIn Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.\r\nSuch references are ambiguous in Scala 3. To continue using the inherited symbol, write `this.stop`.\r\nOr use `-Wconf:msg=legacy-binding:s` to silence this warning. [quickfixable]\r\nApplicable -Wconf / @nowarn filters for this fatal warning: msg=<part of the message>, cat=other, site=org.apache.spark.deploy.client.StandaloneAppClient.ClientEndpoint.receive\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe new version bring some regression fixes:\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10422\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10424\r\n\r\nAnd a new feature: Quickfixes\r\n```\r\nFor some errors and warnings, the compiler now suggests an edit that could fix the issue. Tooling such as IDEs can then offer the edits, or the compiler itself will make the change if run again with -quickfix.\r\n```\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10406\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10482\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10484\r\n\r\nThe release notes as follows:\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.12\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, Scala version changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass Github\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support Python 3.12 in Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\nNote that this is tested with [NumPy 1.26](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/1.26.0/) and [Pandas 2.1.1](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/2.1.1/), but without `PyArrow` because it doesn't support Python 3.12 yet.\r\n- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/install.html#python-compatibility\r\n> PyArrow is currently compatible with Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.\r\n\r\nPyArrow is still an optional component for Spark SQL and I believe it will support Python 3.12 soon.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPython 3.12 release will happen in a few days on 2023-10-02.\r\n- https://www.python.org/downloads/\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a new addition to PySpark support environment.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs for old Pythons and run manual test with Python 3.12.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python/run-tests.py --python-executables python3.12\r\nRunning PySpark tests. Output is in /Users/dongjoon/PRS/SPARK-44120/python/unit-tests.log\r\nWill test against the following Python executables: ['python3.12']\r\nWill test the following Python modules: ['pyspark-connect',

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the rule PruneFileSourcePartitions where CatalogFileIndex gets converted into InMemoryFileIndex for partitioned tables, if the same tables are referenced multiple times ( with identical filters or otherwise or even with empty filters ( case being translated filter string for pushdown becomes empty), each leaf table will call the HMS layer to get partitions list. \r\nThis PR collects identical tables and its corresponding partition filters and makes a single call to HMS (HiveMetaStor) layer for getting the basic minimum partitions which statisfy each occurence.  Using the base InMemoryIndex , then each table can further apply its own filters ( if needed) to get the desired InMemoryIndex.\r\n\r\nFor eg if Table A  has 2 occurences, each with Filter f1 and Filter f2.\r\n1) Table A.     f1\r\n2) Table A.     f2\r\nA single call to HMS will be made passing the filter condition as f1 || f2\r\nThis will result in baseInMemoryFileIndex.\r\nThen 1) Table A  can apply filter f1 on this baseInMemoryFileIndex to get its own pruned file index.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis has been observed as a major perf bottleneck for complex queries where there are large number of partitions.\r\nIn this particular client,  query compilation/execution time got increased to 6 hrs from 20 mins.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nvalidated using existing tests and added new tests in the file HivePruneFileSourcePartitionsSuite which validate the reduction in HMS calls. The correctness of the results were validated without this change ( I will modify the test to include result validations)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSmall improvements can be made to the way new ExecuteGrpcResponseSender is attached to observer.\r\n* Since now we have addGrpcResponseSender in ExecuteHolder, it should be ExecuteHolder responsibility to interrupt the old sender and that there is only one at a time, and to ExecuteResponseObserver's responsibility\r\n* executeObserver is used as a lock for synchronization. An explicit lock object could be better.\r\n\r\nFix a small bug, when ExecuteGrpcResponseSender will not be waken up by interrupt if it was sleeping on the grpcCallObserverReadySignal. This would result in the sender potentially sleeping until the deadline (2 minutes) and only then removed, which would potentially delay timing the execution out by these 2 minutes. It should **not** cause any hang or wait on the client side, because if ExecuteGrpcResponseSender is interrupted, it means that the client has already came back with a new reattach, and the old sender is being kicked out.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMinor cleanup of previous work.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests in ReattachableExecuteSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr replace all `mutable.WrappedArray` with `mutable.ArraySeq`. Simultaneously, this PR unifies all uses of `scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq` by first `import scala.collection.mutable` and then using `mutable.ArraySeq`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn Scala 2.13.0 and later, `WrappedArray` is marked as deprecated, its replacement is `mutable.ArraySeq`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\npackage object mutable {\r\n  @deprecated(\"Use ArraySeq instead of WrappedArray; it can represent both, boxed and unboxed arrays\", \"2.13.0\")\r\n  type WrappedArray[X] = ArraySeq[X]\r\n  @deprecated(\"Use ArraySeq instead of WrappedArray; it can represent both, boxed and unboxed arrays\", \"2.13.0\")\r\n  val WrappedArray = ArraySeq\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-29T09:08:30Z","updated_at":"2023-11-22T14:52:10Z","closed_at":"2023-09-29T22:24:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d80c31ec8c87b633a02270f9f8594b48a4ce326","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43178/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43178/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43178/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e2c769aabe15bb931e0d665a06264c1fbd1aae40","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-45380","ref":"SPARK-45380","sha":"e2c769aabe15bb931e0d665a06264c1fbd1aae40","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43126, there is a change from `JavaConverters.seqAsJavaListConverter(array).asJava` to `array.toSeq.asJava`. Since `array.toSeq` will involve an extra `Array.copyOf`, and the involved scenario in the subsequent processing is to directly convert the result of `array.toSeq.asJava` into an `Array[Byte]` result without the possibility of modifying the array content, so this pr replaces `array.toSeq` with `immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray(array)` to avoid the extra `Array.copyOf`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the current scenario, there is no risk of array data being modified, and `immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray(array)` compared to `array.toSeq` avoids an extra `Array.copyOf`, bringing certain performance benefits and reducing memory usage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-28T09:35:20Z","updated_at":"2023-10-01T23:40:42Z","closed_at":"2023-10-01T23:37:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42316c09ff13e27910ca3e5502be5114752d17d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d5ce531c692895e0f189889c155ea58b3f11d086","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-45338-FOLLOWUP","ref":"SPARK-45338-FOLLOWUP","sha":"d5ce531c692895e0f189889c155ea58b3f11d086","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHandle `InputStream`s in the `NettyLogger` so we can print out how many available bytes there are.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs part of the SSL support we are going to transfer `InputStream`s via Netty, and this functionality makes it easy to see the size of the streams in the log at a glance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces test keys for SSL functionality. They keys were generated using something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem -hexseed deadbeef\r\nopenssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in key.pem -out key.pem.out\r\nopenssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.csr -days 3650 -subj \"/CN=test/ST=California/L=San Francisco/OU=Org1/O=Org2/C=US\"\r\nopenssl x509 -req -in csr.csr -signkey key.pem -out certchain.pem -days 3650\r\nrm key.pem csr.csr\r\nmv key.pem.enc key.pem\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then copied to all the relevant folders. I also copied over the keystore and trustore files (did not regenerate those).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe need these test files to run tests using PEM keys for SSL connections.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThese test files will be used by follow up PRs. This was tested as part of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42685, whic is being split.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids a race condition where a connection which is in the process of being closed could be returned by the TransportClientFactory only to be immediately closed and cause errors upon use.\r\n\r\nThis race condition is rare and not easily triggered, but with the upcoming changes to introduce SSL connection support, connection closing can take just a slight bit longer and it's much easier to trigger this issue.\r\n\r\nLooking at the history of the code I believe this was an oversight in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/9853.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change, some of the new tests added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42685 would fail\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests were run in CI.\r\nWithout this change, some of the new tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe purpose of this pr is to add a new test tag `SlowSQLTest` to the sql module, and identified some Suites with test cases more than 3 seconds, and apply it to GA testing task to reduce the testing pressure of the `sql others` group.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor a long time, the sql module UTs has only two groups: `slow` and `others`. The test cases in group `slow` are fixed, while the number of test cases in group `others` continues to increase, which has had a certain impact on the testing duration and stability of group `others`. \r\n\r\nSo this PR proposes to add a new testing group to share the testing pressure of `sql others` group, which has made the testing time of the three groups more average, and hope it can improve the stability of the GA task.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nShould monitor GA\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-28T02:52:37Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T05:26:51Z","closed_at":"2023-09-29T06:51:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb49fb5e998845a2330e084b981df7db5a81163a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change of this pr is to add a call of `SparkFunSuite#wupdateLoggers` after restore loglevel when 'level' of `withLogAppender` function is not `None`, and under the premise of this change, the UT `Logging plan changes for execution` disabled in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43141 can be re-enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Fix bug of `SparkFunSuite#withLogAppender` when 'level' is not None\r\n- Re-enable UT `Logging plan changes for execution` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR projects out PARTITION BY expressions before Python UDTF 'eval' method consumes them.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, if a query included this `PARTITION BY` clause:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM udtf((SELECT a, b FROM TABLE t) PARTITION BY (c, d))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the `eval` method received four columns in each row: `a, b, c, d`.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the `eval` method only receives two columns: `a, b`, as expected.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis makes the Python UDTF `TABLE` columns consistently match what the `eval` method receives, as expected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-09-27T19:22:42Z","updated_at":"2023-09-28T21:03:01Z","closed_at":"2023-09-28T21:03:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e90adf259dd30b6f31aa9d7441a6a749c4bc6be9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43156/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43156/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43156/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/148a8b64b9b29af31d1b85160f67e5d4d62a0b88","head":{"label":"dtenedor:project-out-partition-exprs","ref":"project-out-partition-exprs","sha":"148a8b64b9b29af31d1b85160f67e5d4d62a0b88","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache
