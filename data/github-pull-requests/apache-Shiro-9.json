https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues/1117\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

directly. This may address <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6657\">&quot;Could not find <code>some-dependency</code>&quot; errors</a> that some users have reported (which might be a result of users' excluding <code>guava-parent</code>). (c6d35cf1a5)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Changed <code>Multisets.unmodifiableMultiset(set).removeIf(predicate)</code> to throw an exception always, even if nothing matches <code>predicate</code>. (61dbccfda3)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Fixed the behavior of <code>Graph</code>/<code>ValueGraph</code> views for a node when that node is removed from the graph. (950799691c)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Fixed <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> under <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6634\">Windows <em>services</em>, a rare use case</a>. (The fix actually covers only Java 9+ because Java 8 would require an additional approach. Let us know if you need support under Java 8.) (f87f68cd3e)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Made <code>MediaType.parse</code> allow and skip over whitespace around the <code>/</code> and <code>=</code> separator tokens in addition to the <code>;</code> separator, for which it was already being allowed. (2786f83291)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Tweaked <code>Futures.getChecked</code> constructor-selection behavior: The method continues to prefer to call constructors with a <code>String</code> parameter, but now it breaks ties based on whether the constructor has a <code>Throwable</code> parameter. Beyond that, the choice of constructor remains undefined. (For this and other reasons, we discourage the use of <code>getChecked</code>.)

see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

#1097 \r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

#1079 \r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) <!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

#1004 \r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

#1025 \r\nAdds a 3-valued enum for path-traversal-blockmode. Default is NORMAL, which only blocks actual paths. STRICT also blocks encoded slashes ('/') and periods ('.'). NO_BLOCK disables.\r\n\r\nThis enables a mode to block actual path traversal while still allowing for encoded URLs and such to be present as path parameter.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n -

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-21T23:34:36Z","updated_at":"2023-07-22T00:30:13Z","closed_at":"2023-07-22T00:30:09Z","merged_at":"2023-07-22T00:30:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f18439437a070db04d176062158bf215bbd0e21","assignee":{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/milestones/1/labels","id":5478228,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTQ3ODIyOA==","number":1,"title":"2.0","description":null,"creator":{"login":"bdemers","id":99954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers","html_url":"https://github.com/bdemers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":55,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-05-29T14:27:07Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T17:03:03Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-02-28T17:03:03Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/1018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/1018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/1018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/statuses/138d05d9caf7237ea1591bfb6063665d76381743","head":{"label":"lprimak:update-deps-jul21","ref":"update-deps-jul21","sha":"138d05d9caf7237ea1591bfb6063665d76381743","user":{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/

Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

automatically anyway\r\n* Add checkbox regarding setting a milestone\r\n\r\nremoved rat from PR issue template - runs automatically anyway without explicitly specifying it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

#897 by adding bug report, documentation related, enhancement request, feature request, and question issue templates.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using
