[X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nRemove fixed seed and adjust correct tolerance in 2 tests - test_deformable_psroipooling_with_type, test_deformable_convolution_with_type\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@haojin2 @marcoabreu

Description ##\r\nFix MKLDNN debug issue in PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10026\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Use functional flatten method as opposed to built in\r\n- [x] Increase tolerance for similar ndarray\r\n- [x] Use reordered inputs\r\n- [x] Re-enable MXNET_MKLDNN_DEBUG flag in CI\r\n- [x] Added exclude flag for LRN backwards operator as fcompute vs fcomputex operators accepts different number of inputs\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix for issue #11733 \r\nProblem was that the random input data was cast from higher precision to lower precision and then results between different precisions compared. Fix was to start with lower precision data and cast to higher precision data so that all precisions compute on the same data.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nadded support to check_consistency function to generate random numbers for a specific datatype (ie. fp16)\r\n\r\nthis ensures that for tests that compare results among different precisions, that data is generated in the least precise type and casted to the most precise\r\n\r\nchanged test_pooling_with_type test case to specify fp16 precision for random input data\r\nrenamed the 2nd test_pooling_with_type function to test_pooling_with_type2 so it doesnt redefine the first and both are tested\r\n\r\nfixed equation formatting issue in pooling operator description\r\n\r\nAdded myself to the contributors readme file\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability for an arange operator to leave the stop value unspecified, so that it will be inferred from the output shape (via backward shape inference). This is important to achieve shape polymorphism for efficient bucketing. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] allow start and stop to be the same\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The more natural way of doing this would be for the stop parameter be None, but this was already used for a syntactic feature that allows arange(5) to be used to mean arange(0, 5).

Description ##\r\nAddress #11496 and add selu activation function\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support `selu` option in leaky_relu\r\n- [x] Corresponding unit tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTest passed 10000 times on both CPU &

Description ##\r\nMKLDNN can be turned off with USE_MKLDNN env flag\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] add fallback logic in storagetype to fallback if USE_MKLDNN var set\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-07T03:17:55Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T00:01:51Z","closed_at":"2018-08-17T00:01:51Z","merged_at":"2018-08-17T00:01:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"6843914f642c8343aaa9a09db803b6af6f5d94a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nPylint throws an error for variables that are used but not defined previously. Since these variables are found in paths that are not executed, they don't show up as errors at runtime. But if executed, they could throw a Python NameError.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- autoencoder/model.py - ModuleNotFoundError is not available in Python2.

Description ##\r\nAdd DLPack Transformation API\r\n\r\n[DLPack](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack) is important for sharing tensors and operators among Deep Learning Frameworks.\r\nIssue: #11964 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add `MXNDArrayToDLPack`, `MXNDArrayFromDLPack`, `MXNDArrayCallDLPackDeleter` and `MXNDArrayCallDLPackCapsuleDeleter` in `c_api` \r\n- [x] Add `ToDLPack()` and `FromDLPack` for the class `NDArray`\r\n- [x] Add the constructor `TBlob(const DLTensor &dltensor)`\r\n- [x] Add the function `DLDataTypeTransform` in `tensor_blob.h` for the transformation from `DLDataType` to `MShadow Type Flag`\r\n- [x] Add `NDArray(const TBlob &data, int dev_id, const std::function<void()>& deleter) function`\r\n- [x] Add `mx.nd.NDArray.to_dlpack_for_read`, `mx.nd.NDArray.to_dlpack_for_write`, `mx.nd.to_dlpack_to_read`, `mx.nd.to_dlpack_for_write` and `mx.nd.from_dlpack`\r\n- [x] Add unit-test for DLPack Transformation API\r\n## Comments ##\r\n[Extra Test with

Description ##\r\nMake check_isfinite, check_scale optional in clip_global_norm. If both are set to false, clip_global_norm does not force any synchronization and throughput can be increased. Note if check_scale=False, this requires multiplying all arrays with 1 in cases where the multiplication could be skipped by doing a blocking check.\r\n\r\nWhile this PR preserves the old default behavior of using blocking calls, we may want to change the default behavior to improve throughput.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Make check_isfinite, check_scale optional in clip_global_norm\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This improves throughput in https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/pull/253 by around 10%.\r\n@eric-haibin-lin

PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @marcoabreu

Description ##\r\n`_kvstore.row_sparse_pull` creates a local row_sparse copy of the parameter based on row_ids before it's copied to the destination. To save a checkpoint for the parameter, the local copy is not needed since all rows are needed. In that case, call kv.pull instead of kv.row_sparse_pull to avoid such copy. \r\n\r\n@szha @leezu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for

Description ##\r\nCorrected the doc for SGD, and added missing docs for a few other optimizers. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-05T06:03:59Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T23:34:21Z","closed_at":"2018-08-06T16:56:48Z","merged_at":"2018-08-06T16:56:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"70efd32a49e05fd0e7224496259ddacdaf61aa2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/81441be8d52a2ced353fa1d406cbde1838639cb1","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:fix-optim-doc","ref":"fix-optim-doc","sha":"81441be8d52a2ced353fa1d406cbde1838639cb1","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThere is unexpected behavior with MXNet Context cpu_pinned for nonzero values of device.\r\nThis PR fixes this unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fix unexpected behavior with cpu_pinned Context\r\n- [x] A class mxnet::common::cuda::SetDevice that collects what device was active before cudaSetDevice was called, and restores it to this device once the MXNet has done what it needs to do. This is done when the SetDevice object goes out of scope\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nOn master branch, if you do:\r\n```\r\n>>> import mxnet as mx\r\n>>> data = mx.nd.zeros((2,3), ctx=mx.Context('cpu_pinned', 7))\r\n>>> print(data)\r\n\r\n\r\n[[0. 0. 0.]\r\n [0. 0. 0.]]\r\n<NDArray 2x3 @cpu_pinned(7)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks right. However, `nvidia-smi` tells me that this data is actually located on GPU 0:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ nvidia-smi\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| Processes:                                                       GPU Memory |\r\n|  GPU       PID   Type   Process name                             Usage      |\r\n|=============================================================================|\r\n|    0    109140      C   python3                                      524MiB |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this unexpected behaviour, I changed four things:\r\n1) call cudaSetDevice and set current device to GPU X we want to allocate on even for kCPUPinned case (src/storage/storage.cc)\r\n2) before, Context::real_dev_id returns the GPU id for kGPU, and 0 for both kCPU and kCPUPinned even though it stores the dev_id that the user passed into the constructor as a private member (include/mxnet/base.h)\r\n3) add guard to every place cudaSetDevice is called in MXNet C++ code. This guard is implemented using the class mxnet::common::cuda::SetDevice. The purpose of this guard is to prevent race conditions on which device was set first. Other GPU libraries have something similar e.g.

Description ##\r\nPartial fix for https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11509.\r\n\r\n``check_numeric_gradient`` is disabled because it intermittently hangs due to resource contention in a multithreaded environment. The above issue will be used to track progress on this.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@eric-haibin-lin @szha @leezu

Description ##\r\n`reduce_kernel_M1` did not call Reducer::Reduce and Reducer::Finalize. This was OK before https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11573 introduced Reducer::Finalize but would result in wrong results now (see below). It was not caught by CI, as CI only tested the `reduce_kernel_M1` only in a small number of runs (depending on the shape returned by `rand_shape_nd`).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

Description ##\r\nFix for issue [#11695](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11695) -- Removing fixed seed as the flakiness is not producible with increased tolerance\r\n\r\nThe test only failed at one instance with the original tolerance, however I did not record the seed that caused the failure.  After ~40k additional iterations, I have been unable to reproduce another failure with the original tolerance.  However, the increased tolerance would have accepted that failure, so I updated it.\r\n\r\nRan `tests/python/unittest/test_loss.py:test_hinge_loss` and `tests/python/gpu/test_operator_gpu.py:test_hinge_loss` 10k times each without producing the error at an increased tolerance\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files,

PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] add attribute to all mkldnn operators to identify mkldnn\r\n- [x] convert inputs to default array if using fcomputeex operator that is not mkldnn\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-03T01:38:12Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T05:48:09Z","closed_at":"2018-08-30T22:07:32Z","merged_at":"2018-08-30T22:07:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"32c9ca74839ae4d275bcf9a027ea0a711373be81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x ] Remove fixed seed for

Description ##\r\n**1. fix flaky test #11685 \r\n2. Pass 10,000 runs.**\r\n**3. Root cause explained:** \r\n\r\nIn this unit test, during testing of mx.sym.maximum and minimum. It didn't cover the case when x and y is equal. \r\n See [Line 100](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/tests/python/unittest/test_executor.py#L100)\r\nwhen x = y, the following line \r\n```\r\nlambda g, x, y: (g * (x>y), g * (y>x)\r\n```\r\nwill return `(0, 0)` when the correct value should be `(1, 0)`\r\n\r\nIn MXNet symbolic implementation, mx.sym.maximum and minimum is using the following logic for element-wise comparison:\r\n\r\nmaximum is using  (greater or equal, less than) see [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/tensor/elemwise_binary_broadcast_op_extended.cc#L96)\r\nminimum is using  (less or equal, greater than) see [here](\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/tensor/elemwise_binary_broadcast_op_extended.cc#L131)\r\n\r\nModified accordingly and removed fixed seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-774](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-774) \r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n1. fixed gradient condition\r\n2. removed fixed seed\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix for #11740. Remove fixed seed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Remove fixed seed for test_sparse_ndarray/test_operator_gpu.test_sparse_nd_pickle\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nPassed 10000 times on both CPU & GPU:\r\n```\r\npython tools/flakiness_checker.py

Description ##\r\nFix for #11703 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Remove fixed seed for test_loss/test_operator_gpu.test_triplet_loss\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nPassed 10000 times on both CPU &

Description ##\r\n\r\nThe initial changes have graph executor changes, we plan to extend these changes to CachedOp based on feedback.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to address below two tasks from subgraph TODO #11896\r\n\r\n* enable graph partitioning in CachedOp and bind of the symbol executor.\r\n  infer shape/dtype/storage info before graph partitioning and pass nnvm::Graph that carries * * \r\n * shape/dtype/storage info as an argument when creating a subgraph node.\r\n\r\nSample flow:\r\nsymbol -> bind -> infer shape/type on given symbol (no full graph) -> graph w/ shape/types attrs -> partition pass for given accelerator using default subgraph selector/property -> new graph with subgraph nodes -> continue graph_exec as before (construct full graph with gradient and execute). \r\n\r\nAccelerators can replace default subgraph property with their own customized subgraph property that can take advantage of types/shape attr on the graph in partitioning pass.\r\n\r\n@zheng-da

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-02T21:51:12Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T23:58:40Z","closed_at":"2018-09-24T23:58:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f48d7f6d03ee9c95e1a3fe18e5df48ebb747e5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Description ##\r\nAccessing the shared ccache statistics is not threadsafe and causes deadlocks as seen in http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/incubator-mxnet/detail/master/1310/pipeline. They were only there for debugging purposes and thus we're removing them now.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds the necessary components for an automated flaky tests detection measure, the design of which is detailed [on the wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Automated+Flaky+Test+Detector).\r\n\r\nThese components, diff collator, dependency analyzer, and flakiness checker are used by the check_flakiness script, which will be run in a Jenkins pipeline to automatically check PRs for flaky tests. Once active, the tool will mark PRs  that cause flaky tests so that they can be fixed before being merged with master.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Moved flakiness_checker.py to flaky_tests folder, along with other improvements\r\n- Added script, check_flakiness.py, which will be used in a Jenkins pipeline to check commits for flaky tests\r\n- Added Jenkinsfile and docker run-time function to automate the checking of commits for flaky tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-02T02:21:31Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T17:58:17Z","closed_at":"2018-11-27T17:58:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd08a3a033fefe33810c389d5f03eb64b5343d2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":823355562,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTU1NjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Feature%20request","name":"Feature

Description ##\r\nWhile trying figure out how to debug the Sphinx website theme for #11916, I found the build tools frustratingly slow and nearly impossible to use for problems related to a full site build with the versions dropdown. So, I rewrote parts of it so you can do amazing and practical things like:\r\n\r\n:star: Decide what documentation sets to build on a per version basis!\r\n:star: Speed up the full version site build by 2.5x (was 43 minutes, now 17 minutes)!\r\n:star: Make incremental front-end site updates and build 14.3x faster (was 43 minutes, now 3 minutes)!\r\n:star: Optimize Sphinx configurations and pass these updates to the older versions of the site!\r\n:star: Not want to rage quit every time the docs build fails 40 minutes in!\r\n:star: Actually run the R docs build!\r\n\r\nI'm pretty stoked. I hope you are too.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Preview\r\nI'm actively running tests here, but you can see the current output (probably): http://34.201.8.176/\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n:boom: Each version build happens in its own folder. This lets the MXNet build be cached if there's no update to the library. Big win for time savings here. Tradeoff is it takes up more space.\r\n:boom: When you build Sphinx docs with `make html` you can pass a new param, `BUILD_VER={tag}`, like `BUILD_VER=1.2.0`, and it'll load the settings according to that version\r\n:boom: Settings per version? Yes, in a new file at `/docs/settings.ini` we now have configs for each version and each document set. I could have also used the Makefile, but this seemed to be better for handling all of the version support variations. You can configure the build to build what you want, and more importantly, turn it off for a version where it isn't possible... like for Clojure and any previous version tag. Only the most recent version or master or your fork might have it.\r\n:boom: What's this about your fork? Yes, you can now build docs with your own fork and output different branches of your fork to represent the different version on the website output. :sparkles: Cool, right? :sparkles: Gawd, why didn't I do this earlier!?\r\n\r\nAnd I tweaked the css a bit so the h1-h4 tags pop a little more. The mxnet.css file gets pulled from the artifacts folder now, but we can alter this design down the line.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\n### Building Docs with Sphinx \r\n\r\nFrom the `docs` folder:\r\nYou can just use `make html` and it'll load the defaults which will build everything:\r\n```\r\n[document_sets_default]\r\nclojure_docs = 1\r\ndoxygen_docs = 1\r\nr_docs = 1\r\nscala_docs = 1\r\n```\r\nOr you can use a specific version and it'll load the settings for it:\r\n```\r\nmake html USE_OPENMP=1 BUILD_VER=1.0.0\r\n```\r\nFrom `settings.ini`:\r\n```\r\n[document_sets_1.0.0]\r\nclojure_docs = 0\r\ndoxygen_docs = 1\r\nr_docs = 0\r\nscala_docs = 0\r\n```\r\n### Building the Full Site with Your Fork\r\nThe previous example is a precursor to the more complicated process of building the full site and its many versions.\r\nThe scripts used by CI and that can be used yourself for building dev version of the site are in `build_version_doc` and are still `build_all_version.sh` and `update_all_version.sh`. Now they take optional params for your fork. \r\n\r\nThese scripts call `make docs` which in turn calls `make html` from the `docs` directory. So, they inherit what I just described above using the settings file. The version tags get passed down from the shell script into the docs Makefile invocation, which then is read in the Sphinx plugin `mxdoc.py`, which reads the settings file, which is what then calls all of the other docs generation tools. I had to bubble up the version info all the way to this plugin. \r\n\r\n**Note**: I would certainly like to see this less complicated, but this is the current architecture, so... until we can possible refactor the whole thing with CMAKE, this is what we have to contend with...**\r\n\r\n#### Building Each Version and Optionally Using Your Fork\r\n\r\nBuild the content of the 1.2.0 branch in the main project repo to the 1.2.1 folder:\r\n```\r\n./build_all_version.sh \"1.2.0\" \"1.2.1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the main project repo, map the 1.2.0 branch to output to a 1.2.1 directory; others as is:\r\n```\r\n./build_all_version.sh \"1.2.0;1.1.0;master\" \"1.2.1;1.1.0;master\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing a custom branch and fork of the repo, map the branch to master, map 1.2.0 branch to 1.2.1 and leave 1.1.0 in 1.1.0:\r\n```\r\n./build_all_version.sh \"sphinx_error_reduction;1.2.0;1.1.0\" \"master;1.2.1;1.1.0\" https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Updating Each Version and Optionally Using Your Fork\r\n\r\nAssuming you build 1.2.1, 1.1.0, 1.0.0, and master, you need to inject the versions dropdown to reflect these options for each page on the site:\r\n```\r\n./update_all_version.sh \"1.2.1;1.1.0;1.0.0;master\" master http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/\r\n```\r\nIt doesn't use your fork at this point, but it will pull the latest project README.md from your current branch and use that for the root of the output site.\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\n\r\n### Building R Docs\r\nI'm not adding the R deps and making CI changes here. That's just too much in one PR. However, in a followup PR, or if you want test the pipeline with the R docs build turned on you need the following in addition to the R deps already in the docs setup scripts in CI or the one in `build_version_doc`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install \\\r\n    texinfo \\\r\n    texlive \\\r\n    texlive-fonts-extra \\\r\n```\r\nYou would also want to change `settings.ini` and enable the build of the R docs (per version you want).\r\n\r\n### Building Scala Docs\r\nThe current Scala config is incompatible with version 1.1.0 or earlier. You'll get an error about the namespace change. I'm disabling the build for this in those earlier versions in the provided `settings.ini`. Please discuss with me if this is a bad choice and if we need to use a custom config for those earlier versions. The function in mxdoc.py for scaladocs could use the new version param, and make some conditional statements for how it builds...

Description ##\r\nThis PR is for this issue: #11988\r\nProblem found was the linker removed from this [PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11862) need to be addressed quickly...\r\n\r\n@nswamy @andrewfayres \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nFix #11686, removed fixed seed in test_executor.py:test_dot\r\n\r\n1. Verified this test is flaky and the values for comparison are slightly off\r\n2. Flakiness comes from sym.dot of 2 large tensors. The input tensor size was original set to be a random size in range of (1,500). Reduced 500 to 200 to make it more stable.\r\n3.  The test still fails with 1e-6 tolerance, increased it to 1e-5 (reasonable for fp32)\r\n4. removed helper function `reldiff` (calculating relative difference) with `assert_almost_equal` in `mxnet.test_utils`  for value comparison\r\n5. removed fixed seed\r\n6. Passed 10,000 runs\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with

Description ##\r\nFix for issue #11721 -- Removing fixed seed as the flakiness is not reproducible.\r\n\r\nRan ``` tests/python/unittest/test_operator.py:test_laop_4 ```\r\nand ``` tests/python/gpu/test_operator_gpu.py:test_laop_4 ``` for 100k times each.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Remove fixed seed for test_operator:test_laop_4\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nCPU Run : \r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_COUNT=100000 nosetests

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nUpdate: Mac OS 10.3 is supported in CI. Fixed unit test error in coreml to mxnet converter and add it to CI. This PR will also resolve issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11841\r\n~~Added unit test for mxnet to coreml converter. It can run on MacOS 10.2 and beyond. The small test only converts MXNet model to CoreML model without running inference to verify.

Description ##\r\nCachedOp can't record computation in the graph when it is used for nested call (CachedOp calls another CachedOp) in the dynamic mode. The reason is that CachedOp sets thread local is_recording to be false and affects all operators called inside CachedOp.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge,

Description ##\r\npython/setup.py modified to accept a package name argument. This way, platform-specific packages such as mxnet-jetson can be created automatically. \r\n\r\nModified ci/docker/runtime_fuctions.sh so that build_jetson() calls python/setup.py using mxnet-jetson as name.\r\n\r\n## Usage info ##\r\n\r\nThese changes are useful when calling build.py with jetson as target platform. \r\n\r\n`./build.py -p jetson`\r\n\r\nThe output wheel will have `mxnet-jetson` as package name, instead of `mxnet`.  This way, it can be uploaded to PyPi as a Jetson-specific package. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here","created_at":"2018-07-31T13:30:09Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T17:40:15Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T17:40:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"919e47b3eb1ec510c6d57f8a4a6ac066fd6778a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET ` happens too late, by that time CMake already looked for the newest CUDA version\r\n- It's deprecated behaviour to call `find_package(CUDA)` and when using first language support in CMake for CUDA\r\n- Now the user can select the proper CUDA version by running CMake with `-T cuda=<version>` as specified by CMake documentation\r\n- CUDNN was ignoring CUDNN_ROOT provided

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes some bugs for control flow operators `mx.sym.contrib.while_loop` and `mx.sym.contrib.cond`.\r\n\r\nTakeaways:\r\n- if now I understand correctly, we should call `MXSymbolCutSubgraph` to capture free variables of a closure before calling `MXSymbolGetInputSymbols`. I guess we should document this so that others won't be confused.\r\n- `symbol._internal.something` always return a single Symbol, regardless of how many outputs it actually has.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Bug fixes\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- See

Description ##\r\nPrevious, using nn.Embedding(sparse_grad=True) with out-of-bound data would result in segmentation fault in backward(). This PR checks the bound of indices and prints an error for that case. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis bot will send daily [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues) reports with predictions of unlabeled issues.\r\nIt contains 2 parts:\r\n* Machine Learning part:\r\n  A web server built based on AWS Elastic Beanstalk which can response to GET/POST requests and realize self-maintenance. It mainly has 2 features:\r\n  * Train models: it will retrain Machine Learning models every 24 hours automatically using latest data.\r\n  * Predict labels: once it receives GET/POST requests with issues ID, it will send predictions back.\r\n* Send Daily Emails: \r\n  An AWS Lambda function which will be triggered everyday. Once this lambda function is executed, it will send POST requests to the Elastic Beanstalk web server asking predictions. Then it will general email content and send email.\r\n@Roshrini  @lanking520  @marcoabreu \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n-

PR implements [this proposal](https://discuss.mxnet.io/t/reshaping-broadcasting-without-hardcoding-target-dimensions/851/5) for generalizing the `reshape_like` operator, so that it has more flexible handling of which dimensions of the input and target tensors are used in the reshaping process.\r\n\r\nThere are a few differences from the proposal in the previous discussion. For example, to be consistent with the inputs names of `reshape_like` (`lhs` and `rhs` instead of `src` and `target`), the parameters were called `lhs_begin` rather than `src_begin` etc. \r\n\r\nI've also added tests for `reshape_like`, which didn't exist before, along with better documentation.\r\n\r\n@ThomasDelteil, @taliesinb

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n**This PR helps cleanup some of problems to pave the way for a better understanding of how the parts work together, and how they might be updated or replaced.**\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n**Note**: while this might provide a simple preview and help test the left nav and toctree features, I'd advise looking at a full site build with the versions dropdown.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n1. docs/get_started folder is deleted: it only held a redirect which already being handled by [.htaccess](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet-site/blob/asf-site/.htaccess#L3). Removing it reduces warnings/errors.\r\n1. docs/architecture/release_note_0_9.md is deleted: it was the only legacy release note. Release notes are held on the [releases page](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases). Removing it reduces warnings/errors.\r\n1. Sphinx's `docs/conf.py` updates:\r\n    - `exclude_patterns` : added these to reduce warnings/errors: ['build_version_doc' (working dir), 'api/python/model.md' (depricated), 'README.md' (not needed for Sphinx's indexing)] \r\n    - update config to the working Sphinx version 1.5.6\r\n    - update config to 2018 copyright\r\n    - update config to have correct project URL\r\n1. I disabled/removed some functionality it `docs/_static/js/sidebar.js`. I was able to find some info about it by digging through old commits and PRs, but many of the PRs and commits have no description or commit message. I can see that the functionality may have been of some benefit before where it magically modified the output of Sphinx. However, since it wasn't documented, this caused me hours of frustration when Sphinx's documented behavior was being nullified by this client-side activity. \r\n    - Replaying the previous sidebar layout and merging with the existing one plays havoc with the UI after one has gone through and configured the toctree for each folder. This is why I removed it. It is possible if the original authors took a look, they could update it, but for reasons I outline later, I think it would be better to remove it.\r\n    - Adding Clojure to the nav can come in a separate PR. But since I was in the sidebar already, I added it.\r\n1.  Added new index pages where ones were missing or modified existing ones. This is generally a good practice for SEO, and drastically improves the warnings/errors situation. \r\n    - I used the `:hidden:` directive for `tutorials` and `faq` as they already have custom indexes, but were the source of many warnings/errors.\r\n    - I skipped modifying index pages that did not result in warnings/errors.\r\n    - I used the `:glob:` pattern where I could to auto-index a folder. This works best when there are no subfolders to index. You can see this mostly in the tutorials section. :\r\n```\r\n.. toctree::\r\n   :glob:\r\n    *\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n-  As we gear up for foreign translations of the site, I really can't see how undocumented, custom client-side overrides are going to be maintainable. We should work within the features of the site generator. I recommend we try to fix the site at it's core and as part of a regular build pipeline, and remove these kind of \"magical\" features.\r\n- There is additional complexity with the versions dropdown that seems to be covered in the sidebar logic. Disabling this client-side hack might result in uncovering more issues and entanglements. I'd appreciate any SMEs to assist figuring out solutions that can help simply things and get us ready for internationalization of the site.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThese changes gets triggered in a regular `make docs`, but you can run just the Sphinx section of the docs pipeline by commenting out these in `docs/mxdoc.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#app.connect(\"builder-inited\", generate_doxygen)\r\n#app.connect(\"builder-inited\", build_scala_docs)\r\n#app.connect(\"builder-inited\", build_clojure_docs)\r\n```\r\nThen run (from `/docs`):\r\n```bash\r\nmake html\r\n```","created_at":"2018-07-27T17:00:23Z","updated_at":"2018-08-17T23:41:45Z","closed_at":"2018-08-17T23:41:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70c0ea28318b5aecb6768d4de398e740537735df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708199304,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgxOTkzMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Website","name":"Website","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR
