the introduction of timer output timestamps, a new watermark hold had been\r\nadded to the Flink Runner. The watermark computation works on the keyed state\r\nbackend which computes a key-scoped watermark hold and not the desired\r\noperator-wide watermark hold.\r\n\r\nComputation:

adds a Reshuffle transform to the Go SDK.\r\n\r\n* In particular, it configures windowing & trigggers for a GBK to allow for fusion breaks, where parallelism needs to increase, or decrease due to data bundling properties.\r\n* Previous element window and timestamps are preserved.\r\n* The SDK operations are wrapped with a higher level reshuffle URN so runners can optimize this step better.\r\n* The Go Direct Runner is aware of the Reshuffle and correctly ignores it, as it's a single bundle runner. \r\n\r\nNote: While this should work for streaming cases, it hasn't been tested with them yet, due to the current state of streaming the Go SDK.\r\n\r\nIt further adds one small optimization for the internal Decoding interface, called the DecodeTo method to avoid extra allocations to the heap incurred by returning a *FullValue. Can't avoid extra allocations for KV types at present, but value PCollections should have lower overhead. A subsequent PR will use the DecodeTo method at a other applicable places in the decode stack.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The problem: when the CombineGlobally raises the ValueError, it\r\nbreaks out the process of transform `apply` where the current transform\r\nhas been pushed into a transform stack, to be expanded and then popped out in the end.\r\nWithout the popping out, the pipeline will hold a current transform that\r\nis referring the failed CombineGlobally transform and never changes,\r\nmeaning the pipeline will not accept any new transforms after.\r\n2. It did not affect non-interactive usages because when the pipeline\r\nconstruction runs into an error, the user has to restart the whole\r\nprogram and nothing has been executed at the point the error is raised,\r\nso no side-effects.\r\n3. It did leave the pipeline in a dead state when the user constructs\r\npipelines in an interactive environment.\r\n4. The pop before raising the error allows the transform stack to\r\nrecover from the failed state.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Info logging to notify users about invoking evict_captured_data on\r\nchanging capture_duration, capture_size_limit, and capturable_sources\r\noptions. The users have to explicitly evict captured data because the\r\nprocess is destructive and the usage should be the same as evicting\r\ncaptured data even when they don't modify options at all.\r\n2. Info logging about behavior difference between enabling capture\r\nreplay and disabling it. This functions as a switch enabling/disabling\r\nthe replayability, thus works without the need of evicting captured\r\ndata.\r\n3.

HL7v2IO connector for the Google Cloud Healthcare API.\r\nInitial work for these connectors is being prioritized based to support various \r\ncustomer use cases for HL7v2 -> FHIR ETL pipelines.\r\n\r\nHealthcare clients are extremely concerned with not losing data in their pipelines and want dead letter queues for these sources / sinks.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind the `HL7v2IO.Read` is designed as a mini pipeline that:\r\n  - Starts with an arbitrary `PTransform` to populate a `PCollection` of message IDs. This was chosen to give flexibility between reading the HL7v2 pubsub notifications, reading an entire HL7v2 store (with optional filter) or using some other method (e.g. a hand prepared subset of message IDs uploaded to GCS and read w/ TextIO). In the future we can gain efficiency here when the Healthcare API exposes a batch read method where we can batch up requests rather than making a separate call per element.\r\n  - Then a DoFn that attempts to fetch the actual message contents from the HL7v2 store. Successfully fetched messages will be written to `HL7v2IO.Read.OUT` tag and Failures will be written to a `HLv2IO.Read.DEAD_LETTER` tag. The \"expected\" failure case would be attempting to fetch a message ID that doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the `HL7v2IO.Write` is designed as a mini pipeline that \r\n  - starts with a `PTransform` that attempts to ingest a `PCollection` of `Messages`\r\n  - then applies the `this.getDeadLetterPTransform()` to the `PCollection` of messages that failed to ingest. This gives the customer the ability to capture dead letters in a system of their chosing (e.g. gcs, bq, pubsub) based on their needs.\r\n\r\n- [HL7v2](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/hl7v2-messages):\r\n  - Unbounded Read: Uses PubsubIO to read [notification subscription](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub#hl7v2_messages)\r\n  - Bounded Read: DoFn to get message IDs using the [Messages.List](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.datasets.hl7V2Stores.messages/list) REST API method\r\n\r\nFuture Work will include a very similar IO transform for FHIR store:\r\n- [FhirIO](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-bundles)\r\n  - Write use the [executeBundle](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.fhir/executeBundle) REST API method to execute transactions on the FHIR Store\r\n  - Read with [read](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.fhir/read) / [search](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores.fhir/search) / from [notification subscription](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub#fhir_resources)\r\n\r\n# Linkage Check\r\n([log](https://gist.github.com/jaketf/2f5363a00f4469d066a482a9fc0f77e2))\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The problem: PCollections never used as inputs and not watched, such as\r\nsinks without being assigned to variables is currently pruned before `p.run()`.\r\n2. The change makes sure that these \"side effect\" PCollections are now\r\nconsidered as extended targets and will be executed on `p.run()`.\r\n3.

problem was that the StreamingCache needed a way to communicate with the BackgroundCachingJob that it was done, so it knew when to stop tailing the file. This was previously done with capturing the user_pipeline when making the StreamingCache. However, the StreamingCache is used as a global cache for all pipelines. Thus, when the pipeline was redefined the StreamingCache had a stale reference to the previous pipeline and would loop forever.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to change the cache key of PCollection to be pipeline specific. In this PR, it can be seen that the pipeline id is used in the cache key. This is used to tell the StreamingCache what pipeline it's associated with. The StreamingCache can't be created with the user_pipeline because the  pipeline_instrument object is dependent on the cache which creates the user pipeline.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

removes the ProcessContext#updateWatermark and updates all existing usages to use the WatermarkEstimators and also updates all the backing code that supplied the functionality to use the WatermarkEstimators as their source of truth.\r\n\r\nThe watermark estimator state has become a part of the \"restriction\". In non-portable pipelines this only appears during processing and hence is stored in state while in portable pipelines we get the watermark estimator state when we get the initial restriction and plumb it through the the split restriction to be used as the initial watermark estimator state within the various process element and restriction methods.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
