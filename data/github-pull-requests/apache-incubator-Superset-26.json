href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/releases\">fetch-retry's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Type definition of the defaults parameter</h2>\n<p>Adds type definition for the <code>defaults</code> parameter in the <code>fetchBuilder</code> function. Previously it was mistakenly typed as <code>object</code> which was not very helpful.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/simeonborko\"><code>@​simeonborko</code></a> for reporting the issue and providing the PR.</p>\n<h2>Fix type definition to support URL instance</h2>\n<p>Fixes a bug where URL instances could not be passed as the first argument to the wrapped fetch function.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/afmelsaidy\"><code>@​afmelsaidy</code></a> for reporting the issue and providing a pull request.</p>\n<h2>Adds example on how to use with Node.js fetch and fixes failing tests</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds an example on how to use with Node.js fetch API which became available in version 18.</li>\n<li>Fixes failing tests when running Node.js version 18, which failed due to using an older version of node-fetch, resulting in having multiple versions of the <code>Request</code> object.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Security updates: minimist</h2>\n<p>Updated dependencies and fixed security issues reported in dependencies, most notably minimist.</p>\n<h2>Bug fixes and security fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pwambach\"><code>@​pwambach</code></a> fixed an issue where typescript definition no longer was valid. The fix was to use a default export instead.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bamse16\"><code>@​bamse16</code></a> fixed an issue where npm install for <code>production</code> and <code>ci</code> would fail due to <code>husky</code> being defined as a dev dependency</li>\n<li>Security fixes, including a <code>high</code> severity issue for <code>node-fetch</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for all the contributions, and apologies for taking a long time to merge the fixes.</p>\n<h2>Bug fix for node environment</h2>\n<p>Fixes a bug (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/issues/63\">#63</a>) introduced in version 5.0.0 where support for the <code>Request</code> argument was added. The initial implementation introduced a runtime error for the node environment.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/paulrosania\"><code>@​paulrosania</code></a> for reporting the issue, and to <a href=\"https://github.com/knotthere\"><code>@​knotthere</code></a> for creating a PR with the suggested fix.</p>\n<h2>Improvements and bug fix</h2>\n<p>This release includes a bundle of improvements and a bug fix. Due to the renaming of the <code>IRequestInitWithRetry</code> interface, I have created a new major release to attempt to mitigate any potential breaking changes.</p>\n<p>Included in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename <code>IRequestInitWithRetry</code> to <code>RequestInitWithRetry</code> and export the interface (<a href=\"https://github.com/christophehurpeau\"><code>@​christophehurpeau</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Use rollup.js to support UMD builds (<a href=\"https://github.com/dwiyatci\"><code>@​dwiyatci</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Adding support for Request argument (<a href=\"https://github.com/knotthere\"><code>@​knotthere</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Added integration tests for Request argument and URL type (<a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern\"><code>@​jonbern</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Added husky pre-commit script to build project and run tests (<a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern\"><code>@​jonbern</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Upgrade dependencies to fix security warnings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many thanks for all the contributions for improving this project. It is greatly appreciated! 🙏</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/228661ec3e2cc5c3d8188cf5221125e809badc8f\"><code>228661e</code></a> 5.0.6</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/0c1dce6af3dfc278d7f318e8f437a6152e2f5ec5\"><code>0c1dce6</code></a> keep RequestInitRetryParams type public to avoid potential breaking change</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/74d8001a998d15575a41055b1460f4f24f350100\"><code>74d8001</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/issues/87\">#87</a> from simeonborko/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/abdf56283c18504fef1e9851f325142c7cb1d293\"><code>abdf562</code></a> Type definition of the defaults parameter</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/7023d6889e08afdc35d96c37840a42288f06f64b\"><code>7023d68</code></a> 5.0.5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/14ed6fd8310dcb0a417b07408a569d7b8d138b23\"><code>14ed6fd</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/issues/84\">#84</a> from afmelsaidy/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/6d0fbf392985deb0d418bfbe65360f841bfe55d2\"><code>6d0fbf3</code></a> Fix type definition to allow passing URL or RequestInfo</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/f375c7040211265b9c2939efc39438386d7844d2\"><code>f375c70</code></a> 5.0.4</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/72b5a5c3aac09b707855bd0afba5fd0c15e19c79\"><code>72b5a5c</code></a> adds build status badge (GitHub actions)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/commit/2ed3d7871cdf3d8b6bfb4c2e5a6f88fb7712e0b8\"><code>2ed3d78</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/issues/83\">#83</a> from jonbern/feat/node_native_fetch</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jonbern/fetch-retry/compare/4.1.1...5.0.6\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=fetch-retry&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=4.1.1&new-version=5.0.6)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nYou can trigger a rebase of this PR by commenting `@dependabot rebase`.\n\n[//]: # (dependabot-automerge-start)\n[//]: # (dependabot-automerge-end)\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>Dependabot commands and options</summary>\n<br />\n\nYou can trigger Dependabot actions by commenting on this PR:\n- `@dependabot rebase` will rebase this PR\n- `@dependabot recreate` will recreate this PR, overwriting any edits that have been made to it\n- `@dependabot merge` will merge this PR after your CI passes on it\n- `@dependabot squash and merge` will squash and merge this PR after your CI passes on it\n- `@dependabot cancel merge` will cancel a previously requested merge and block automerging\n- `@dependabot reopen` will reopen this PR if it is closed\n- `@dependabot close` will close this PR and stop Dependabot recreating it.

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/199\">#199</a></p>\n<h2>v7.1.4</h2>\n<p>Avoid creating new objects for same clusters across zooms, improving memory footprint and making sure the same clusters have the same <code>cluster_id</code> across zoom levels. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/190\">#190</a></p>\n<h2>v7.1.3</h2>\n<p>Fix a bug where coordinates of unclustered points were snapping to a grid on higher zoom levels. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/176\">#176</a></p>\n<h2>v7.1.2</h2>\n<p>Fix <code>fround</code> fallback on IE11 so that the  v7.1.1 small radius bugfix is effective there too.</p>\n<h2>v7.1.1</h2>\n<p>Fix a bug where identical points sometimes wouldn't cluster on higher zooms given a small radius.</p>\n<h2>v7.1.0</h2>\n<p>Added <code>minPoints</code> option for the minimum number of points to form a cluster (<code>2</code> by default).</p>\n<h2>v7.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>generateId</code> option to generate numeric ids (<code>feature.id</code>) for input features that don't have it.</li>\n<li>⚠️ Possibly breaking: adjusted generated cluster id values to make sure there are no collisions when combined with <code>generateId</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v6.0.2</h2>\n<p>Slightly improved performance of <code>map</code>/<code>reduce</code> by avoiding redundant <code>map</code> calls. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/mapbox/supercluster/issues/131\">#131</a></p>\n<h2>v6.0.1</h2>\n<p>Fixed a bug introduced in v6.0.0 where some aggregated cluster properties were calculated incorrectly.</p>\n<h2>v6.0.0</h2>\n<p>⚠️ <strong>Breaking:</strong> removed <code>initial</code> option of the map/reduce functionality. Now Supercluster uses the first mapped item of the cluster as the initial value:</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>// before\nvalue = initial;\nreduce(value, a);\nreduce(value, b);\n...\n// after\nvalue = a;\nreduce(value, b);\n...\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen a user enters multiple queries in one tab and wants to execute each of them, they would have to highlight the SQL they want to execute (in previous versions), which would not be ideal for extremely long queries. To solve this problem, I created the getCurrentQuery function to **allow executing each query without the need to highlight the specific query they wish to run**. Instead, users can **place the cursor at the intended query and press the RUN button**.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that **queries must be separated by either at least one blank line or a semicolon**, and **no blank lines are allowed within the same query**. When the cursor is placed at the blank lines between two queries, the upper query will be executed. This also handles the case when a semicolon is part of the query.\r\n\r\nThis function was actually created a long time ago, and I found that in newer versions, there already exists a shortcut key to execute the current query. I wanted to share this implementation in case it might be useful or maybe created as another shortcut key.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/ce96ec0b-9462-4f6d-9c49-01a91fe6b947\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/96282005/755150a8-a985-4308-90a6-d584f5a3a711\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe are adding the implementation and usage of the AWS S3 upload feature in Apache Superset. This feature allows users to send reports directly to an AWS S3 bucket. There are three methods available for authentication: taking credentials from the user in the frontend, taking credentials from the superset_config.py file, or utilizing an AWS IAM role associated with the ECS task role.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n#### Installation and Setup\r\n\r\n- Ensure Apache Superset is installed and running.\r\n\r\n- Ensure S3 bucket policy is configured for interacting with AWS S3.\r\n\r\n- Configure Apache Superset to enable the AWS S3 upload feature.\r\n\r\n- Follow the method-specific setup instructions outlined below.\r\n\r\n#### Common Configuration for Enabling AWS S3 feature for all below method.\r\n\r\n- User should update the superset_config.py (docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config.py) file with following:\r\n\r\n- Uncomment the following code in superset_config.py.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# AWS S3 reporting - uncomment to use\r\n# FEATURE_FLAGS = {\"ALERT_REPORTS\": True, \"ENABLE_AWS\": True}\r\n#ALERT_REPORTS_NOTIFICATION_DRY_RUN = False\r\n# AWS Credentials\r\n#AWS_ACCESS_KEY = '####'\r\n#AWS_SECRET_KEY = '####'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Method 1: Frontend User Credentials\r\n\r\n1. When accessing the feature in the frontend, users will be prompted to enter their AWS credentials.\r\n\r\n2. Users should provide their AWS Access Key and the AWS Secret Access Key in the user interface itself.\r\n\r\n3. Ensure proper IAM policies are applied to the user's credentials to grant necessary permissions for uploading to the specified S3 bucket.\r\n\r\n#### Method 2: config.py Credentials\r\n\r\n1. Update the config.py file in your Apache Superset installation directory.\r\n\r\n2. Add the AWS credentials as configuration variables in superset_config.py.\r\n\r\n3. Ensure proper IAM policies are applied to the user's credentials to grant necessary permissions for uploading to the specified S3 bucket.\r\n\r\n#### Method 3: AWS IAM Role\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the ECS task running Apache Superset is associated with an IAM role.\r\n\r\n2. Configure the IAM role's permissions to allow uploading to the desired S3 bucket.\r\n\r\n3. Apache Superset will automatically use the IAM role associated with the ECS task for authentication when uploading to S3.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\nOnce setup has been done, the AWS S3 can be used for sending reports/alert directly to the S3 bucket using following0 AWS S3 method options:\r\n\r\n- AWS_S3_credentials\r\n\r\n- AWS_S3_pyconfig\r\n\r\n- AWS_S3_IAM\r\n\r\n· Navigate to settings, then on Alerts & Reports.\r\n\r\n· Create alert /report like we use to do with the Email or Slack.\r\n\r\n· In the Notification Method select S3.\r\n\r\n· Then select the available S3 method options: AWS_S3_credentials, AWS_S3_pyconfig, AWS_S3_IAM.\r\n\r\n· Fill the required aws credentials in case of AWS_S3_credentials else just give the bucket name to use.\r\n\r\nLike Email, we can also create the reports directly to the Aws S3 bucket from the dashboard and charts page. All three S3 method options would be available from the dashboard and charts page.\r\n\r\n· Navigate to any of the dashboard or Chart.\r\n\r\n· Create the report using Set up a S3 report and use any of the S3 method options available.\r\n\r\n· Generated report can be seen in the Alerts & Reports page.\r\n\r\nNote: If the User doesn’t enable the feature flag of ENABLE_AWS, but has ALERT_REPORTS set to True then Aws s3 option wouldn’t be available but he can still use the default Notification method from the Apache Superset i.e. of Email.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n<!--- Check

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen `SqllabBackendPersistence` is enabled, the tab_history only populates the most recent active tab. As a result, if a user closes a tab upon first loading, the tab_history disappears, yet the UI component still loads the latest tab. This unintentionally displays the \"unloaded\" tabstateview, which consists of the defaultSqlEditor value that includes a placeholder SQL like `SELECT * FROM WHERE`.\r\nThis recent commit addresses and rectifies this issue, ensuring the tabstateview loads correctly when an unloaded condition tab is activated. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFixes #21328.\r\n\r\nIf you create a Gauge Chart with interval bounds and a minimum value set, the color boundaries are placed incorrectly. This PR changes the boundary calculation to take the minimum value into account during normalization by using the formula described [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/70807).\r\n\r\nI've also updated the part of the test file where the interval calculation gets tested.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore (boundary between green and red should be at value 10 but isn't):\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-02-27 16-58-21](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/102797966/524860b7-4d41-4ee8-a163-8169f7f2f13a)\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-02-27 16-59-06](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/102797966/676f341d-048f-45ab-835a-b8eeb3a7d16e)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Gauge chart, e.g. with exported_stats example dataset\r\n2. Select AVG(daily_members_posting_messages) as Metric\r\n3. On Customize tab, set INTERVAL BOUNDS to 10, 16.53 and INTERVAL COLORS to 3, 6\r\n4. Set MIN to 8\r\n5. Now the boundary between green and red gets updated with the rest of the chart\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dataset-add datasource): do not pass db as prop when creating a new dataset\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n- the previous practice involves auto auto populate database (stored in local storage) into the newly created dataset, which will create bugs when database name changes, database is deleted, or when database meta is changed.\r\n- the practice of saving and fetching latest modified database through localStorage is a potentially technical debut, making it easy to introduce regression that cannot be tracked. looking to potential bugs next.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n- stale database data in localStorage \r\n![2024-02-27_20-37](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/25937657/89c87daa-d8b7-4c82-b184-33b5d83da60c)\r\n- after fix

database\r\n- create a new dataset, and you will see the option not prepopulated.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen adding notification methods to an alert or report, a user can select duplicate methods (select email twice or slack twice). This PR updates the behavior to exclude notification methods that are already being used.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the delete notification method for additional methods only appears after a user has selected a notification method. This PR changes this so that the ability to delete additional notification methods is always available, even if the method has not yet been selected.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/7bb024ba1d2a483eb6db44be6c137e32?sid=5620dc39-24aa-4165-8b12-39dddf6b48b5\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/c4c9c68f4f0446f18f5e4cbf1064d052?sid=3caccb4a-e2ec-4cd4-989e-d34ec31e6b7e\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nEnsure that within either your local superset_config.py or docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config_docker.py files, you have a SLACK_API_TOKEN string filled in. It doesn't need to be an active api token, just any string.\r\n\r\nOpen superset and navigate to the alerts and reports section.\r\nCreate an alert or report and open the Notification method collapse section.\r\nObserve that there are two options for notification method.\r\nAdd a new notification method.\r\nCheck the options of the newly added notification method which should exclude the previously added option.\r\n\r\nUpdate the method of the first notification setting, and ensure that subsequent notification settings are being removed, and the add notification method button reappears.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen exporting to Excel, currently datatypes are not specified, leading to decimal numbers being stored as strings, which may lead to issues when opening the file.\r\n\r\nDepending on the locale, the issue may not even be visible, Excel managing to convert things. (that's the case in us/en locale). When using another locale (say fr), then numbers, output with '.' as decimal separator and stored as strings won't be usable as numbers in Excel.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to use the same \"datatype guessing\" method already existing, and use it to convert dataframe columns types when required before exporting.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nnot applicable\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n- Create a Table dashboard with numercical and decimal numbers in it. Ideally add some strings and dates.\r\n- Export to Excel\r\n- you can then unzip the .xlsx file, and open sheet1.xml in a text editor to check the export\r\n- Numbers appear directly in xml cell reference\r\n- Strings are not visible directly, instead a `<s>` markup is used containing an id to the string\r\n\r\nEditing the sheet1.xml file is the safest way to check the issue, due to magical operations softwares like Excel, LibreOffice Calc or others perform when opening files that may hide the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

command): Apache Superset \"Factory Reset\" CLI command #27207\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nOver time, Apache Superset instances can accumulate large amounts of data, including charts, dashboards, saved queries, and other artifacts. There might be scenarios where users want to start fresh with a clean slate, removing all existing data.\r\n\r\nTesting and Development: Developers and administrators often require a quick and efficient way to reset Apache Superset instances to a default state for testing purposes or when setting up development environments.\r\n\r\nData Privacy and Security: In some cases, there might be sensitive or confidential data stored within Apache Superset that needs to be wiped out completely to ensure data privacy and security compliance.\r\n\r\nWhat is the proposal?\r\n\r\nImplement a Factory CLI command: Develop CLI command that allows users to trigger a factory reset of Apache Superset. This CLI should be designed to delete all existing data, including charts, dashboards, saved queries, databases, and other related artifacts.\r\n\r\nAuthorization and Confirmation: Ensure that the CLI requires appropriate authorization to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, consider implementing a confirmation mechanism to prevent accidental data loss.\r\n\r\nDocumentation and Best Practices: Provide comprehensive documentation on how to use the Factory Reset CLI, along with best practices for when and how to perform a reset. Include warnings about data loss and the irreversible nature of the operation.\r\nError Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling mechanisms within the CLI to handle any unexpected errors gracefully. Additionally, log all reset operations for auditing purposes.\r\n\r\nIntegration with Configuration Management: Optionally, provide integration with configuration management tools or scripts to automate the process of resetting Apache Superset instances in a controlled and reproducible manner.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\n- I received a reported issue by our company members, that files downloaded through Slack are not opening properly.\r\n- Upon investigation, I found that the problem is due to the absence of file extensions in the uploaded filenames on Slack. Consequently, the files are attempting to open with a default text editor.\r\n- So, I added a simple logic to append file extension with argument of slack file_upload API\r\n  -

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user selected Custom range for comparison on Big Number With Time Period Comparison chart, the filter control would accept any column. That worked but didn't make much sense, so this PR restricts the control to accept only dttm columns for filtering.\r\nPlease note that user can still write custom sql which will filter anything, so that's just a UX improvement.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/b4a63051-72f4-4a3c-900d-67aabcc79ba1\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create Big Number With Time Period Comparison chart\r\n2. Select Custom range for comparison\r\n3. Verify that you can drag only temporal columns\r\n4.

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user creates and saves a Big Number chart and then switches to Big Number Period over Period, the chart appears blank. The reason for that is that Period over Period chart expects the values coming from `header_font_size` control to be pixels. However, the old Big Number chart uses proportions (0.2-0.6) in that control, so when the new chart inherits those values, the size in pixels is <1, so it seems blank.\r\nThis PR implements a mapping between proportion values used in Big Number and actual pixel size values expected by Period over Period chart.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR moves the KPI chart to a common directory with other BigNumber plugins so that they can share to font size controls.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n1. Create a new Big number chart using the Vehicle Sales chart.\r\n2. Save the chart\r\n3. Switch to Big Number with Time Period Comparison\" chart\r\n4. Finally, update the chart.\r\n5. Verify that the chart renders correctly\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds a new Jinja macro: `{{current_user_email()}}`. This macro can be specially useful when applying RLS based on the logged in user, as it's typically easier for organizations to have the email address information available in their warehouse (as opposed to the Superset account's `username` or `id`).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26808.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Navigate to SQL Lab.\r\n2. Execute `select '{{current_user_email()}}' as my_email;`\r\n3. Validate that your email address is properly displayed.\r\n\r\nTests also added.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26808\r\n- [x] Required feature flags: `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING`\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes several issues with the SSH Tunnel option in the Database Modal which are related to edit the SSH Tunnel config, enable/disable the option, and misc fixes/enhancements. In particular:\r\n\r\n- Removes a duplicate `SSHTunnelSwitch` component from dynamic forms and merges the logics of both dynamic and SQLAlchemy forms into one overridable component\r\n- Fixes an issue that made removing the SSH tunnel config impossible when editing a database connection\r\n- Delegates the deletion of a ssh tunnel to the `UpdateDatabaseCommand`\r\n- Fixes an issue with the SSH tunnel config still being included in the request even when toggled off\r\n- Fixes an issue for which the switch was showing also with `SSH_TUNNELING` OFF.  Saving would cause a \"SSH Tunneling is not enabled\" error\r\n- Surfaces to the user a missing port error in the SQLAlchemy uri when enabling SSH Tunnel (the port is required for the tunnel to work)\r\n- Clean the SSH Tunnel config from unnecessary credentials when switching from password to private key\r\n- Improves the UX so that toggling ON and OFF the SSH Tunnel config won't clear the form until saved\r\n- Misc fixes\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/60598000/c38052d6-53b0-47d8-a87a-391a647085d9\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/60598000/f65ad7da-962f-4500-82f2-eb42bd2139ba\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a new database connection using a SQLAlchemy uri and dynamic forms, make sure SSH Tunnel can be toggled ON and OFF and that configs can be saved successfully\r\n2. Edit a database connection that has a SSH Tunnel config, make sure the SSH Tunnel can be toggled ON and OFF and that it keeps the config available to the user until toggled OFF and saved\r\n3. Edit a database connection that has a SSH Tunnel config, make sure any change to the SSH tunnel can be saved successfully\r\n4. Re-open the database config and make sure the SSH Tunnel has been deleted successfully\r\n5. Create or edit a database connection using a SQLAlchemy uri without specifying the port, make sure an error is surfaced to the UI informing that specifying a port is necessary\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

#27006\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nGiven that the loadDatabases function assigns the totalCount based on the length of options rather than the total count from the response, it doesn't fetch the keyword, as it always satisfies that all options are fetched.\r\nThis commit aims to correct the inappropriate totalCount assignment, thereby addressing the root cause of the issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER
