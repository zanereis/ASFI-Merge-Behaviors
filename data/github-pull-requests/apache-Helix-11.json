Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues #1184 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n     ZkHelixClusterVerifier and its subclass built with ZK addres would\r\n    create an internal ZkClient. Without properly closing the ZkClient\r\n    or using global ZkClient in the test base. There would be four\r\n    threads and one ZooKeeper client object leaked. The leaked threads\r\n    would be in thousands and thus be one of the main contributor\r\n    preventing the unit test from finishing.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1075\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously, the workflow garbage collection logic was removed in fear of race conditions (PR: #803 ). As we see value in bringing back workflow garbage collection, we are getting rid of the race conditions and bringing back the logic. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, two items need to be completed:\r\n1. Avoid direct dependency of garbage collection stage on the cache. We can instead deliver the relevant content of the cache into the stage during sync time, and use it during async time. This way the race condition with cache is no longer an issue. \r\n2. We are getting rid of an unnecessary JobConfig write that serves no purpose to avoid possible race conditions.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestGetExpiredJobsFromCache, testWorkflowContextGarbageCollection(recovered from old PR), testWorkflowGarbageCollection\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1155, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,495.443 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testEnableCompressionResource(org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression)  Time elapsed: 160.699 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource(TestEnableCompression.java:117)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance(org.apache.helix.integration.TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions)  Time elapsed: 2.3 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance(TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.java:97)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testDisableFullAuto(org.apache.helix.integration.TestDisablePartition)  Time elapsed: 5.599 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<OFFLINE> but was:<LEADER>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestDisablePartition.testDisableFullAuto(TestDisablePartition.java:202)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.integration.TestDisablePartition.testDisableFullAuto(org.apache.helix.integration.TestDisablePartition)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestDisablePartition.testDisableFullAuto:202 expected:<OFFLINE> but was:<LEADER>\r\n[INFO]   Run 2: PASS\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:97 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1154, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:15 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-29T01:25:06-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nRerun\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 37.825 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  43.271 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-29T09:37:30-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1168 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn this PR, loadNewTask() method is added to TaskStateModel to dynamically load tasks that are not already defined in task factory registry. This prevents the need to implement task-specific Participants and thus, enables numerous use cases with minimal extra coding effort beyond implementing the task logic itself.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestDynamicTaskLoading\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestZkHelixPropertyStore.testSet:123 1000 Gets should be finished within 200ms, but was 486 ms expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterStateVerifier.afterMethod:98 » IllegalState ZkClient already closed...\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterStateVerifier.testResourceSubset:115 » Helix Failed to create pause...\r\n[ERROR]   TestHelixAdminCli.testDeactivateCluster:604 » Helix There are still LEADER in ...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1161, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:12 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-12T16:49:21-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nRerun:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 31.465 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  36.538 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-12T16:56:54-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 14.818 s - in org.apache.helix.store.zk.TestZkHelixPropertyStore\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  19.823 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-12T16:58:57-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 9.768 s - in org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  15.102 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-12T17:00:27-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 30.482 s - in org.apache.helix.tools.TestHelixAdminCli\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  35.727 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-08-12T17:04:04-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1166 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\ntestPartialBaselineAvailability\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWAGED Rebalancer by design only supports one-off migration of resources. As a result, its `getBaselineAssignment()` did not consider the case of a cluster that's partially managed by WAGED. It tries to get baselines for all resources from the cluster; if there's no baseline data, it gets current states for all resources as a fallback. It doesn't care for resources that don't have baseline while other resources have baselines - when that's the case, the resources that don't have baseline will not fallback to their current states; they will simply not have baselines. A similar problem happens to `getBestPossibleAssignment()`. \r\n\r\nThe logic is now changed to a per resource level. If a resource has baseline, the baseline will be used; else, the current state will be used. `getBestPossibleAssignment()` will be fixed the same way. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1155, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,324.66 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testResourceSubset(org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier)  Time elapsed: 1.025 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.apache.helix.HelixException: Failed to create pause signal\r\n        at org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier.testResourceSubset(TestClusterStateVerifier.java:115)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] afterMethod(org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier)  Time elapsed: 1.062 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: ZkClient already closed!\r\n        at org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterStateVerifier.afterMethod(TestClusterStateVerifier.java:98)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testCustomizedViewAggregation(org.apache.helix.integration.TestCustomizedViewAggregation)  Time elapsed: 12.133 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestCustomizedViewAggregation.validateAggregationSnapshot(TestCustomizedViewAggregation.java:238)\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestCustomizedViewAggregation.testCustomizedViewAggregation(TestCustomizedViewAggregation.java:394)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testStateTransitionTimeOut(org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource)  Time elapsed: 36.061 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut(TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.java:171)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testPeriodicRefresh(org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh)  Time elapsed: 2.015 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<7> but was:<6>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.spectator.TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh(TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.java:192)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestCustomizedViewAggregation.testCustomizedViewAggregation:394->validateAggregationSnapshot:238 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut:171 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestRoutingTableProviderPeriodicRefresh.testPeriodicRefresh:192 expected:<7> but was:<6>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterStateVerifier.afterMethod:98 » IllegalState ZkClient already closed...\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterStateVerifier.testResourceSubset:115 » Helix Failed to create pause...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1155, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:12 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-22T18:49:39-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nRerun\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 38.505 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  43.912 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-22T19:12:42-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #1162 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe want to make the routing data source configurable. As such, using HttpRoutingDataReader as the static Singleton that fetches and caches the routing data is no longer appropriate. This change adds an implementation of RoutingDataManager and the new RoutingDataReader interface, with HttpRoutingDataReader as one of its implementations. This is the first step towards making routing data source configurable - other readers will be added in the future commits.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestRoutingDataManager.java\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nzookeeper-api:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 37, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 54.08 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 37, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] -----------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n```\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalance.testChangeIdealState:303->validate:646 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1153, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n```\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 58.561 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1156 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn the test testDuplicateMsg from TestRebalancePipeline, currently an invalid session id is used. Here's the detail:\r\nsetCurrentState(clusterName, \"localhost_0\", resourceName, resourceName + \"_0\", \"session_1\", \"SLAVE\"); \r\nThe wrong session id makes the following test and assertion meaningless. This PR uses the correct session id  liveInstances.get(0).getEphemeralOwner() instead. Meanwhile, we found a NPE thrown out during the pipeline and cause the pipeline to stop, which is due to the missing of `setAsyncTasksThreadPool` action. This PR also fixed the issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nhelix-core\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterInMaintenanceModeWhenReachingMaxPartition.testDisableCluster:119 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalanceRunningTask.testFixedTargetTaskAndEnabledRebalanceAndNodeAdded:330 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1153, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:14 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-19T22:08:21-07:00\r\n\r\n\r\nhelix-rest:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 30.642 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  35.801 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-19T23:40:27-07:00\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1090 \r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an initial callback when user adds a listener to Helix routing table. This initial callback will ensure uses are able to perform operations, e.g. read routing table data or some other actions, immediately after they add the listener instead of waiting for the first data change to trigger the callback.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are modified for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestRoutingTableProvider.java\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestResourceChangeDetector.testResetSnapshots:431 » ThreadTimeout Method org.t...\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1209, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:12 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-09-24T14:47:28-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLocal test passed. \r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1148 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe issue was that if ZkHelixManager.disconnect() is called when the ZK connection is not synConnected, the disconnect() call will hang and never return. This usually blocks Helix users' code when they try to clean up and finalize after ZK connection becomes unrecoverable.\r\nThis PR introduces a temporary thread to finish the cleanup work which relies on the ZK connection (or application code). This thread will be interrupted if ZK connection breaks before or during the disconnect process.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkConnectionLost.testDisconnectWhenConnectionBreak()\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1152, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,613.998 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1152, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nhelix-rest\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 46.568 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1146\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs part of ZooKeeper API separation initiative, most metric-related classes were moved to metrics-common module. However, there were some that were left in helix-core for backward-compatibility purposes, but these were causing class conflicts at runtime.

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #957 \r\nFixes #1141\r\nFixes #1143  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn this PR, several scheduling parts have been changed which enforces the scheduler to respect maximum number of attempts for the tasks.\r\n\r\nAlso, it has been observed that when a task being dropped and scheduled again, max number of attempts is not being respected. In this PR, further checks is added to not schedule the tasks again once we reach its maximum number of attempts.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is race condition for _existsLiveInstanceOrCurrentStateChange flag which has been fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\nNote: Several of the tests have been changed. Specially the tests with strict MaxNumberOfAttempts. These tests need to be changed because they are mostly related to the targeted jobs. Once we start the participants and targeted partition bounces between the participants, the tasks needs to be reassigned and number of attempts for the task will increase. We haven't noticed it before since we haven't been respecting MaxNumberOfAttempts for the DROPPED tasks.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1139 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe TaskStateModelFactory initialization creates a thread pool. The expectation is that the application code closes the thread pool and the threads when the participant instance is shutting down. In most cases, this means the JVM is going to be shutdown. So this operation is not a must. However, in the test cases, these thread pools leak thousands of threads.\r\nThis PR adds cleanup logic to shutdown thread pools that are created for the participant instances. Note that there is still thread leakage when the participants are created separately instead of using the general methods.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo new tests.\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n**This PR allows my MacBook to finish the tests.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1137\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe ZkClient leakage is currently blocking the whole test suite to finish. This change cleans up some leaking tests and adding the finalize method to the critical ZkClient resource holders. Since we have enforced GC between test classes, these finalize methods will help to release a major part of the leakage.\r\nNote that this fix still cannot eliminate all the undesired leakages.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nno new tests added.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalance.testChangeIdealState:271->validate:614 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1151, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:18 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-03T16:31:55-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 50.068 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.WagedRebalancer.TestWagedRebalance\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 56.318 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-03T16:33:44-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nmetadata-store-directory-common\r\n\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]  T E S T S\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Running TestSuite\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.567 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  6.296 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-03T11:19:09-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1133 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, `getIdealAssignmentForWagedFullAuto()` gets its final resource assignment results from the partition state mapping of output, which is calculated within the best possible state calculation stage. However, the partition state mapping contains the N+1 cases, which isn't suitable for certain use cases.\r\n\r\nWe would like to allow this function to return an assignment result that's based on the preference lists, which are closer to be the \"calculation result\" done by Waged.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1151, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,678.895 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testEnableCompressionResource(org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression)  Time elapsed: 218.88 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource(TestEnableCompression.java:117)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testStateTransitionTimeoutByClusterLevel(org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource)  Time elapsed: 37.98 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeoutByClusterLevel(TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.java:196)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeoutByClusterLevel:196 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1151, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:18 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-13T15:10:11-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nRerun\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 40.697 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  45.758 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-13T15:29:29-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1042\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix does not check if an instance's topology config is defined correctly when the instance is added or joins cluster. This will cause Helix to fail the rebalance. This change adds the sanity check when\r\n1. Instance joins cluster\r\n2. User update InstanceConfig using RestApi\r\n3. Controller prepares the topology structure for rebalance <-- Currently we only check here\r\n\r\nThis change also centralized the logic for topology sanity check. \r\nThere are 2 behavior change for AssignableNode.computeFaultZone. The new logic is the same as in class Topology. It is better to have a centralized util function for both places. The two behavior changes are:\r\n1. Originally, if clusterConfig.topology is null and Instance zoneId is none, AssignableNode.computeFaultZone will use instance's name while the logic in Topology class throws exception. \r\n2. Originally, if clusterConfig.topology is not null but clusterConfig.faultZoneType is null, AssignableNode.computeFaultZone will throw exception while the logic in Topology class uses the last valid type in clusterConfig.topology.\r\n\r\nThis changes makes the behavior consistent and use the logic in Topology class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestParticipantManager.testValidateDeltaInstanceConfigForUpdate\r\nTestPerInstanceAccessor.simpleIntegrationTestNeg\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\nFailures:                                                                                                                                                 \r\n[ERROR]   TestResourceChangeDetector.testResetSnapshots:431 » ThreadTimeout Method org.t...                                                                       \r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.integration.TestDisablePartition.testDisableFullAuto(org.apache.helix.integration.TestDisablePartition)                                  \r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestDisablePartition.testDisableFullAuto:202 expected:<OFFLINE> but was:<LEADER>                                                                 \r\n[ERROR]   Run 2: TestDisablePartition.testDisableFullAuto:114 » ZkClient Failed to delete /Test...                                                                \r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>                                     \r\n[ERROR]   TestControllerLeadershipChange.testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring:262 expected:<true> but was:<false>                                                \r\n[INFO]                                                                                                                                                            \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1162, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]                                                                                                                    \r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 10, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 29.329 s - in org.apache.helix.controller.changedetector.TestResourceChangeDetector\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 20.066 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestDisablePartition                \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 26.942 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 11.773 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.controller.TestControllerLeadershipChange\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1121 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSome of the validation logic in GenericBaseDataAccessorBuilder and GenericZkHelixApiBuilder were confusing and there were no usage tests. This commit reviews the consistency between validate methods of BaseDataAccessor APIs and writes test cases to demonstrate how they should be used.\r\n\r\nAlso, connection timeout setting wasn't being honored in the createZkClient() methods, so this bug was fixed as well.\r\n\r\ncreateZkConnectionConfig() was removed from RealmAwareZkClient because the intended purpose of this method isn't clear and was not being used anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestMultiZkHelixJavaApis\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nzookeeper-api:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 37, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 51.491 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 37, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:116 » ThreadTimeout Method...\r\n[ERROR]   TestAutoRebalanceWithDisabledInstance.testDisableEnableInstanceAutoRebalance:69 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterInMaintenanceModeWhenReachingMaxPartition.testDisableCluster:119 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:128 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1149, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n```\r\nRan the failures individually:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 50.52 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  56.059 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-01T12:05:50-07:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nhelix-rest:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 33.513 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1120\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis is to prevent the WAGED rebalancer reads stale assignment records from the previous rebalance pipeline.\r\nFor example,\r\n1. Resource A was the only resource. And it is rebalanced by WAGED, then we have a persisted assignment for A.\r\n2. Resource A was reconfigured to using DelayedRebalancer, then we stop the WAGED rebalancer since there is no more resource using WAGED. So the persisted records are still in ZK.\r\n3. Resource A is recreated and using WAGED again. In this case, the previous persisted assignment is no longer valid. We should treat A as a brand new resource instead of considering the stale assignment record.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this change will help to clean up the ZK persisted data if no resource is using WAGED.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestAssignmentMetadataStore, TestWagedRebalancer\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1149, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:25 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-26T00:00:39-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 14.508 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobQueueCleanUp\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 23.728 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-26T00:01:34-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix #1118 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    Helix may see stale data when session expires and get reconnected to\r\n    a slower ZKServer. This would cause various correctness problem.\r\n    We would call sync() to ZKserver first. This ensures Helix would\r\n    not see data that saw before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestAutoSyncWithNewSessionEstablishment()\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:116 » ThreadTimeout Method...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1152, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:22 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-22T03:30:16-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0-M3:test (default-test) on project helix-core: There are test failures.\r\n[ERROR] \r\n[ERROR] Please refer to /home/ksun/helix_kaisun2000/helix/helix-core/target/surefire-reports for the individual test results.\r\n[ERROR] Please refer to dump files (if any exist) [date].dump, [date]-jvmRun[N].dump and [date].dumpstream.\r\n[ERROR] -> [Help 1]\r\n[ERROR] \r\n[ERROR] To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.\r\n[ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.\r\n[ERROR] \r\n[ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible solutions, please read the following articles:\r\n[ERROR] [Help 1] http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MojoFailureException\r\n[ksun@ksun-ld1 helix-core]$ mvn test > test.out 2>& 1 \r\n\r\nIndividually run this timeout test would work.\r\n\r\nsecond run result.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1116 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nUnit test testMsgTriggeredRebalance() consistently fails, because we allow ignoring pending messages and sending ST messages when current state equals pending msg's to state. We should change the test condition a bit to allow messages number >= 1. \r\n\r\nTwo changes for the test:\r\n1. verify messages on each live instance are not purged. [here](https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1117#discussion_r444080381)\r\n2. This is the change to pass the test, allowing messages size >= 1.  [here](https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/1117#discussion_r444080381)\r\n\r\nThis PR also formats the file `TestRebalancePipeline.java`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nChanged `testMsgTriggeredRebalance`\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nOnly fix the test so just run and pass the single test.\r\n```\r\nEND testMsgTriggeredRebalance at Tue Jun 23 01:54:12 PDT 2020, took: 7861ms.\r\nShut down zookeeper at port 2183 in thread main\r\n\r\n===============================================\r\nDefault Suite\r\nTotal tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Skips: 0\r\n===============================================\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issue\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#1128 - https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/1128)\r\n\"Add metrics to report the number of messages that have not been completed after a certain of time #1128\"\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdd Cluster and instance level metrics to report the number of messages that have not been completed after their expected completion time.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1) Add expected completion time field to Message, set the default expected completion period to be 1 day (can be configurable via system property).\r\n\r\n2) Add Past-Due incomplete message gauge in both cluster and instance monitor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n \r\nTestClusterStatusMonitor. testMessageMetrics\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR]

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1106 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt's been observed that sometimes using a shared Zk connection could cause issues when we write in-memory tests that shut down ZK server and restart it. This is because with a shared Zkconnection, we may see the client's zxid be higher than that of the server, which is an invalid state in ZooKeeper. Since HelixManager is a single-realm dedicated concept, it is okay to use a dedicated zk connection to pull CloudConfig in getHelixManagerProperty() method. This will solve issues caused by zxid mismatches.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo tests needed.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestCustomizedViewAggregation.testCustomizedViewAggregation:389->validateAggregationSnapshot:233 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:116 » ThreadTimeout Method...\r\n[ERROR]   TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue.testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue:75 » Helix Failed to ...\r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalanceRunningTask.testFixedTargetTaskAndEnabledRebalanceAndNodeAdded:330 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1145, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe failed 4 tests were run individually:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 52.745 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #962 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFor ZkClient's getChildren() operation, if there are a large number of children and the response packet size exceeds jute.maxbuffer default value 4MB on zk client side, ZkClient will get a ConnectionLossException and keep retrying connecting to ZK. The consequence is, the infinite retry may cause heavy GC on ZK server and kill ZK server.\r\n\r\nWe could consider getting number of children in the path and check if it exceeds the limit. If it exceeds the children limit, there is no need to retry and then exist retry.\r\n\r\nThe default children limit is set for helix messages length using UUID. Packet length of 100K messages doesn't exceed 4 MB.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first phase to fix the issue: a workaround to exit retry loop. Once we have a better way to solve the problem on ZK server side, we should remove this check.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- testGetChildrenOnLargeNumChildren\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nzookeeper-api\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 38, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 54.839 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 38, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  58.964 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-22T16:12:28-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nhelix-core\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestCustomizedViewAggregation.testCustomizedViewAggregation:389->validateAggregationSnapshot:233 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalanceRunningTask.testFixedTargetTaskAndEnabledRebalanceAndNodeAdded:330 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1145, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:23 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-22T17:39:02-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6.157 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestRebalanceRunningTask\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 7.442 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestCustomizedViewAggregation\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 11.025 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobQueueCleanUp\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nGet propertyStore endpoint creates a string response for zlib compressed bytes which causes client not able to decompress the data.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds compression and encode support to decompress/encode the compressed bytes properly.\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n\r\n- \"/propertyStore/path?compression=zlib\"\r\n- \"/propertyStore/path?encode=base64\"\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- testGetPropertyStoreWithZLibCompression\r\n- testGetPropertyStoreWithGzipCompression\r\n- testGetPropertyStoreWithEncode\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#767 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nConcurrent modification causes two issues.\r\n1. Regular GC task fails due to concurrent list modification and the stale versions are not removed at all.\r\n2. If, by coincident, there is a newer version in the list other then the current version, then because of the modification of the list inside the loop, the final element (the newer version) won't be filtered but being left in the to-be-removed list. Then the GC task removes the most recent version. For example,\r\n  a) Input, current version \"2\"\r\n  b) Children = [1, 2, 3]\r\n  c) The task avoids checking \"2\", so the list for loop is: [1, 3]\r\n  d) When checking \"1\", it is removed from the list. So the list becomes [3]. Then the loop ends, because the first item has already been looped from the for iteration perspective.\r\n  e) The version to be removed is \"3\"!\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by avoiding concurrent modifications. Also, it simplifies the logic so as to reduce the pending GC tasks.\r\nThe test is also updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkBucketDataAccessor\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp:111 Sets differ: expected [testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB8, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB7, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB6, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB5, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB9] but got [testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB4, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB8, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB7, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB6, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB5, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB9]\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1145, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:19 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-19T19:27:46-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 15.293 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobQueueCleanUp\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 21.621 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-19T21:53:23-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1097 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis is to fix a regression that was introduced by PR #986 \r\nThe PR tried to prioritize the preference list to avoid unnecessary top state transitions. However, there was a bug in the prioritizing logic and if one participant is skipped due to low priority, it won't be picked up again during the calculating. As a result, this participant won't be assigned with any replica even it is originally in the preference list.\r\nThis only happens if the state model has been customized so it is multiple top states and there is an intermediate state with expected count -1 between the top state and the other states.\r\n\r\nThis fix will ensure the skipped participant being checked again until it gets the assignment.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestAbstractRebalancer.java\r\nAdded test data that simulate a customized state model fits the problem statement.\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterVerifier.testResourceSubset:225 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1145, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:25 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-17T18:59:29-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 45.908 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 52.290 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-18T11:40:16-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #1095 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn this PR, the Thread sleeps have been removed from TestWorkflowTermination and replaced with TestHelper verify method.\r\nAlso, testWorkflowJobFail is polling for the Failed state for 10 seconds. However, the tasks in job3 of this workflow need to be retried for 10 times and then this job will go to Failed state. However, 10 seconds might be too short for this case. Hence, in this PR the maxNumberOfAttempts has been set to 5 for the tasks.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1139, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:26 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-15T16:12:13-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nThe failed test succeeded when run individually.\r\nmvn test -Dtest=\"TestJobQueueCleanUp\"\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 14.574 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobQueueCleanUp\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  20.532 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-15T16:43:01-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nhelix-rest:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 47.106 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 163, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  52.804 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-15T16:44:19-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #1082 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn this PR, waitToStop has been changed to make sure workflow/queue is in stopped state if waitToStop returns successfully without Exception. When the queue targetState is set to stop, the queue will go to STOPPING state. STOPPING state is a transient state which means some of the jobs has not ben completely stopped or in terminal state. In other words, some of that tasks within the jobs have not reached the terminal state yet.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestStoppingQueueFailToStop\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1140, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 5,244.233 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testJobQueueAutoCleanUp(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobQueueCleanUp)  Time elapsed: 300.016 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.testng.internal.thread.ThreadTimeoutException: Method org.testng.internal.TestNGMethod.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp() didn't finish within the time-out 300000\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testControllerSwitch(org.apache.helix.task.TestAssignableInstanceManagerControllerSwitch)  Time elapsed: 1.352 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<5> but was:<0>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.task.TestAssignableInstanceManagerControllerSwitch.testControllerSwitch(TestAssignableInstanceManagerControllerSwitch.java:105)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestAssignableInstanceManagerControllerSwitch.testControllerSwitch:105 expected:<5> but was:<0>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1140, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:27 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-10T14:07:27-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nThe failed test succeed when run individually.\r\nmvn test -Dtest=\"TestJobQueueCleanUp,TestAssignableInstanceManagerControllerSwitch\"\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 20.077 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  25.503 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-10T14:37:42-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nhelix-rest:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 162, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 46.785 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 162, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  52.195 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-10T14:36:25-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#931\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the PartitionMovementConstraint will ignore the baseline assignment completely when the previous best possible assignment has the corresponding record.\r\nNote that since the previous best possible assignment might become invalid, the constraint should refer to the baseline assignment as a secondary option.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes this issue by prioritizing the baseline and the best possible assignments instead of just ignoring.\r\nThis reduces the chance of divergences between the baseline and the best possible assignments. Also, it reduces the possibility of bouncing partition assignments.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestPartitionMovementConstraint.java\r\n\r\nI also profiled the rebalancer performance with the change.\r\nSimulate a cluster with 15 nodes. Then execute the following operations,\r\n1. add 20 resources (128 partitions/3 replicas).\r\n2. remove 10 resources that are added first.\r\n3. rolling disable/reset/enable instances by zones (not delayed rebalance is not enabled or there won't be any change after all operations)\r\n\r\nThe final results,\r\n- Before change,\r\nPartition distribution:\tMax\t271.000000\tMin\t209.000000\tSTDEV\t23.880656\r\nMASTER distribution:\tMax\t87.000000\tMin\t79.000000\tSTDEV\t2.870208\r\nSLAVE distribution:\tMax\t184.000000\tMin\t128.000000\tSTDEV\t21.137869\r\nCapacity Usage Partition distribution:\tMax\t271.000000\tMin\t209.000000\tSTDEV\t23.880656\r\n- After change,\r\nPartition distribution:\tMax\t259.000000\tMin\t252.000000\tSTDEV\t2.236068\r\nMASTER distribution:\tMax\t87.000000\tMin\t84.000000\tSTDEV\t0.899735\r\nSLAVE distribution:\tMax\t174.000000\tMin\t166.000000\tSTDEV\t2.716791\r\nCapacity Usage Partition distribution:\tMax\t259.000000\tMin\t252.000000\tSTDEV\t2.236068\r\nThere is an obvious enhancement.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskRebalancerStopResume.testStopWorkflowInStoppingState:513 expected:<STOPPING> but was:<STOPPED>\r\n[ERROR]   TestWorkflowTimeout.testWorkflowTimeoutWhenWorkflowCompleted:116 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterVerifier.testResourceSubset:225 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1139, Failures: 5, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:23 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-11T18:50:17-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 23, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 136.49 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 23, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 02:23 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-12T11:16:55-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no close method to close the lock and the underlying zk client connection. It could result to zk client leak.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdded a close() method to the interface and implementation of the lock, where the zk client will be closed. User will need to call this when they don't need to use the lock any more to avoid zk connection leakage.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestZKHelixNonblockingLock.testCloseLockedLock\r\nTestZKHelixNonblockingLock.testCloseUnlockedLock\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  53.817 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-09T16:09:54-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1075\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously, the workflow garbage collection logic was removed in fear of race conditions (PR: #803 ). As we see value in bringing back workflow garbage collection, we are getting rid of the race conditions and bringing back the logic. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, two items need to be completed:\r\n1. Avoid direct dependency of garbage collection stage on the cache. We can instead deliver the relevant content of the cache into the stage during sync time, and use it during async time. This way the race condition with cache is no longer an issue. \r\n2. We are getting rid of an unnecessary JobConfig write that serves no purpose to avoid possible race conditions.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestGetExpiredJobsFromCache, testWorkflowContextGarbageCollection(recovered from old PR), testWorkflowGarbageCollection\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1153, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,609.951 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testEnableCompressionResource(org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression)  Time elapsed: 218.35 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource(TestEnableCompression.java:117)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testStateTransitionTimeOut(org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource)  Time elapsed: 36.446 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut(TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.java:171)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testHappyPathExtOpZkCacheBaseDataAccessor(org.apache.helix.manager.zk.TestZkCacheAsyncOpSingleThread)  Time elapsed: 1.191 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: zkCache doesn't match data on Zk expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.manager.zk.TestZkCacheAsyncOpSingleThread.testHappyPathExtOpZkCacheBaseDataAccessor(TestZkCacheAsyncOpSingleThread.java:214)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut:171 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestZkCacheAsyncOpSingleThread.testHappyPathExtOpZkCacheBaseDataAccessor:214 zkCache doesn't match data on Zk expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1153, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:16 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-14T11:10:05-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nRerun\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 51.087 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  56.554 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-07-14T11:14:48-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1071 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf configurable write size limit for znrecord serializer is different from the default size 1 MB, especially it is set to larger than 1 MB, writing won't work because it would be blocked by this default size check in zkclient.\r\n\r\nThis PR also reads both `jute.maxbuffer` config and znrecord serializer write size limit, and validates the correctness of data size limit.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- testDataSizeGreaterThanLimit\r\n- testDataSizeLessThanLimit\r\n- testInvalidWriteSizeLimitConfig\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn zookeeper-api module.\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 50,

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe have moved the raw ZkClient to zookeeper-api. As such, we need to deprecate and remove the old one in helix-core. \r\n\r\nTestRawZkClient also has been moved from helix-core to zookeeper-api. Other TestHelper classes were moved and trimmed of unnecessary Helix-related fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestRawZkClient (moved and updated)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:116 Â» ThreadTimeout Method...\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterInMaintenanceModeWhenReachingMaxPartition.testDisableCluster:119 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1137, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1027 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere is a case that after controller leader switches, pipelines of both old Helix controller leader and new leader are running in parallel. Different assignment decisions are sent to different participants so there are double masters for a single partition.\r\n\r\nThe PR addresses this issue by blocking non-leader controller to send messages.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- `testNoMessageSentOnControllerLosesLeadership`\r\n- `TestRawZkClient.testAsyncCreateByInvalidSession`\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 47, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 61.443 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 47, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:05 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-10-04T21:39:20-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1211, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,282.946 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1211, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:11 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-10-06T04:14:23-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1063\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCluster topology fields are considered as the fundamental attributes of the cluster. For example, instance capacity, resource partition count, partition weight, etc.\r\nIf the topology related fields are updated, the WAGED rebalancer will trigger the global rebalance process. Otherwise, the rebalancer will only do local (limited) rebalance to avoid unexpected partition movements.\r\nThis change introduces HelixProperty Trimmer to filter out the non-topology related fields so the changes in those fields won't trigger the global rebalancing.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestHelixPropoertyTimmer\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalanceRunningTask.testFixedTargetTaskAndEnabledRebalanceAndNodeAdded:330 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterVerifier.testResourceSubset:225 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1139, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun,\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 53.647 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 59.991 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-09T14:08:15-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1057\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously, ReadOnlyWagedRebalancer would only read from the previously computed best possible mapping and returns it. This commit changes it so that it computes things from scratch - it can read the previously computed best possible mapping but shouldn't just return it without doing any calculation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:116 Â» ThreadTimeout Method...\r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalance.testRebalanceTool:187 Â» NullPointer\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1149, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:116 Â» ThreadTimeout Method...\r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalance.testRebalanceTool:187 Â» NullPointer\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1149, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\nFixed TestWagedRebalance. The result for running the failed two tests are below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 59.493 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther tests succeed when run individually.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1055\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe are adding 3 endpoints to TaskDriver that return values of `SubmissionToProcessDelay`, `SubmissionToScheduleDelay`, and `ControllerInducedDelay`. The purpose of the endpoints is to offer an option for users that cannot rely directly on the controller emitted metrics to see the metric values. In order for the metrics to be accessible from TaskDriver, the metric values are written to ZooKeeper every time a new metric value is reported. The metric values that are synced to Zk is the mean value. Note: since they are synced on reporting time, if there is no reporting, there is no update to these values. These endpoint values are fresh when there are task framework resources actively running. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestJobMonitor, testGetSubmissionToProcessDelay, testGetSubmissionToProcessDelayIllegalArgument, testGetSubmissionToScheduleDelay, testGetSubmissionToScheduleDelayIllegalArgument, testControllerInducedDelay, testControllerInducedDelayIllegalArgument\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut:171 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1178, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:16 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-02T19:20:23-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nRerun:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 38.517 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  43.765 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-03T09:14:54-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1051 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTest testDropInstance doesn't assert expected exception and ignores the unexpected behavior. ZkBaseDataAccessor is created using a shared zkclient to create a live instance. The creation fails because shared zkclient doesn't support creating a live instance.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this problem by creating a dedicated zkclient in ZkBaseDataAccessor to create a live instance.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nThere is no main code change, so just run this test class including testDropInstance. No more error message.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 41.596 s - in org.apache.helix.tools.TestClusterSetup\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  47.458 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-06-02T19:54:34-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #1044 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n1. Helix jars built based on ivy dependencies don't have the same dependencies as open source helix jars built with pom files. Eg., open source helix-core-1.0.0.jar depends on helix-common-1.0.0.jar, but the helix-core jar built with ivy files does't have such dependency.\r\nThis issue could cause inconsistent behaviors between internal helix lib release and open source lib release. Eg., Duplicate and Conflicting Class MonitorDomainNames happened in open source but not in internal release built with ivy dependencies.\r\nWe would like to make these dependencies consistent so issues like the example could be caught in release certification. This PR updates ivy dependencies.\r\n\r\n2. To address some different dependency versions in helix and resolve potential version conflicts, this PR also upgrades some old dependency versions to the the newer ones in helix.\r\n\r\n**After updating:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5187721/88258877-02004200-cc76-11ea-9e1d-b517e7e6a42e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nRunning...\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1042 Validate instance topology configuration before let it comes online \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe need sanity check for topology definition in InstanceConfig in multiple places. Since we already have sanity check logic in controller/rebalancer/topology/Topology.java and controller/rebalancer/waged/model/AssignableNode.java, it's better to extract the logic into an single util function first and use the same logic to do sanity check in multiple places.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first PR for issue #1042. It extracts the sanity check logic in multiple functions into one single function in Topology.java to align with the topology verification logic in AssignableNode.java. \r\n\r\nIt also changes the implementation for InstanceConfig.getDomainAsMap since to resolve CPU usage hotspot showed in CPU profiler. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo new test is added since this PR is code clean up.\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalance.testChangeIdealState:271->validate:614 expected:<true> but was:<false>                                                      \r\n[ERROR]   TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue.testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue:75 » Helix Failed to ...                                                              \r\n[ERROR]   TestWorkflowTermination.testWorkflowRunningTimeout:126 » Helix Workflow \"testW...                                                              \r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1145, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 40.747 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.WagedRebalancer.TestWagedRebalance\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 9.246 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 32.675 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestWorkflowTermination\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#1028 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAlthough the rebalancer will fix the additional master eventually, the default operations are arbitrary and it may cause an older master to survive. This may cause serious application logic issues since many applications require the master to have the latest data.\r\nWith this state resolver, the rebalancer will change the default behavior to reset all the master replicas so as to ensure the remaining one is the youngest one. Then the double-masters situation is gracefully resolved.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestAbnormalStatesResolver.testExcessiveTopStateResolver()\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nN/A, the newly added logic is only used in the new test case. The other tests won't touch the new logic.\r\nWill run the whole test before merging the branch to master.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-28T23:10:22Z","updated_at":"2020-06-04T18:52:44Z","closed_at":"2020-06-04T18:50:24Z","merged_at":"2020-06-04T18:50:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8bc5fd15976a9820d92fa5818292aa1f3c13589","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/1037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/1037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/c478eae9d3d68a8f742df039d02bb24ef246feec","head":{"label":"jiajunwang:resolver","ref":"resolver","sha":"c478eae9d3d68a8f742df039d02bb24ef246feec","user":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95248544,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTI0ODU0NA==","name":"helix","full_name":"jiajunwang/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiajunwang","id":1803880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1803880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiajunwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiajunwang/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#1032 )\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds check for the existence of customized state path before adding listener to it. The check is mainly for backward compatibility, as our customers may still use previous helix, and do not have customized state root path created. In that case, we should not add listener to non existing path.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1147, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,717.53 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testDisableCluster(org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.TestClusterInMaintenanceModeWhenReachingMaxPartition)  Time elapsed: 5.078 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.TestClusterInMaintenanceModeWhenReachingMaxPartition.testDisableCluster(TestClusterInMaintenanceModeWhenReachingMaxPartition.java:119)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterInMaintenanceModeWhenReachingMaxPartition.testDisableCluster:119 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1147, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n\r\nhelix-rest:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 160, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 180.82 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 160, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  03:04 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-05-27T14:11:30-07:00\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a method, getIdealAssignmentForWagedFullAuto() in HelixUtil that returns to the user the cluster-wide assignment result obtained from running a rebalance using WAGED. The user will be able to use this method to predict how Helix will be rebalancing resources using the WAGED rebalancer.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestRebalanceTool\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:116 Â» ThreadTimeout Method...\r\n[ERROR]   TestControllerLeadershipChange.testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring:262 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue.testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue:75 Â» Helix Failed to ...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1148, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n\r\nIndividual runs of failed tests pass.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nAddress #1003\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen user reset one or more particular partition(s) using resetPartition API, Helix will throw an exception if the given instance can not be found under aliveInstance path. This could be caused by either of of the following reasons:\r\n1. The instance was part of given cluster but is not alive now, or\r\n2. The instance is not part of this cluster ever.\r\nThis PR differentiate these two causes for better debuggability.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a unit test for resetPartition since there is no existing test for it previously.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestResetPartition\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n> [ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestControllerLeadershipChange.testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring:262 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestMessagingService.TestMessageSimpleSendReceiveAsync:240\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeout.testStateTransitionTimeOut:166 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalanceRunningTask.testFixedTargetTaskAndDisabledRebalanceAndNodeAdded:297 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1146, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\nrerun:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 14.992 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.controller.TestControllerLeadershipChange\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 31.445 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.messaging.TestMessagingService\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4.014 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestStateTransitionTimeout\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 21.551 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestRebalanceRunningTask\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:X\r\n\r\n### Code

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #1005 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn this PR, a fix has been implemented to avoid _readyJobList in RuntimeJobDag to contain multiple entries of a job. In this RuntimeJobDah.finishJob we add the next job without considering of it has already been added or not. In this PR, added a test which proves this can happen and I proposed a fix for this issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestEnqueueJobs.testQueueParallelJobs\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestRecurringJobQueue.deleteRecreateRecurrentQueue » ThreadTimeout Method org....\r\n[ERROR]   TestWorkflowTermination.testWorkflowJobFail:223 » Helix Workflow \"testWorkflow...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1145, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:24 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-05-13T13:55:21-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe failed tests have passed when I ran them individually.\r\n```\r\nmvn test -Dtest=\"TestRecurringJobQueue,TestWorkflowTermination\"\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 137.835 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:23 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-05-13T14:21:58-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#996\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a scheduled periodic task to read leftover messages from zk.\r\nThere are several situations that we would need this periodic refresh:\r\n1. A read from ZK fails and there is no more event to trigger another read\r\n2. Watcher is not registered properly so it fails to trigger the callback\r\n3. The message is not processed correctly and is discarded but no more incoming events to trigger another read\r\n\r\nWhat would not be fixed by this PR is out of order problem, which is another issue may cause missing messages. For example, we may miss an event because its callback comes in after a finalize type event, so it will be ignored. Since this periodic refresh is done through generating an event, this out of order issue may affect refresh events too.\r\n\r\nThe refresh is done in callback handler and will be triggered if the time has passed for as long as a user defined interval since last processed event. The refresh is achieved by queuing an empty callback type event into the event processor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestPerioidicRefresh\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nRunning\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is
