the issues listed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-9543\r\n\r\nPlease, see the commit messages for details.  But I will raise one quote from 724a4da:\r\n\r\n> NOTE: This changes how groovydoc generates anchors for Java code.\r\n> groovydoc is using raw types for Groovy code (same as javadoc), but\r\n> types with type parameters for Java code.  With this change, the docs\r\n> for Java code will use raw types, too.\r\n\r\nI.e. whereas groovydoc used to generate anchors like `<a name=\"compare(Class<A>, Class<B>)\">` for Java methods, it will now generate `<a name=\"compare(Class, Class)\">`.  Which is what it did for Groovy methods all along, and what javadoc does, too.   If anyone anywhere in the Internet has linked to such Java method docs, the fragment part of those links will be

based on the fact that java.util.List extends java.util.Collection which in turn extends java.lang.Iterable my suggestion is to remove from DefaultgroovyMethods in Groovy 3.0.X all the deprecated methods that takes a list or a collection as 'self' parameter and were deprecated in favor of the same method which have an Iterable as parameter instead. I think this would greatly simplify having support from other tools (IDEs autocompletion, Static code analyzers...) and simplifies java compiler work making it possible to write other methods in a simpler way. \r\nI also made some of the default groovy methods more type-safe using java generics in method declaration.\r\nSince groovy 3.X targets java8+ jvm i also wrote some methods for the java.util.Stream class and some to obtain a stream based on an Iterable or an Iterator (that i found on groovy GDK documentation but i cannot find them in the source code, maybe they are redundant). Because i was not sure if this is an intended groovy feature i left theese last methods private but you can make them public if they should show up on iterables and iterators.\r\nI refactored also some other methods to leverage stream api in their implementation and make them simpler. I dont't think that theese are breaking changes because i ran all the tests and they all passes, if you like this commit maybe it can be merged on official source base.","created_at":"2020-03-22T12:25:35Z","updated_at":"2020-03-23T02:39:42Z","closed_at":"2020-03-22T23:10:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc1294c3a65bd0b352bd4494d38b35ebd61105e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/f3c35e602157b27bbe28b876d2b485415ba27897","head":{"label":"DarioArena87:GROOVY_3_0_X","ref":"GROOVY_3_0_X","sha":"f3c35e602157b27bbe28b876d2b485415ba27897","user":{"login":"DarioArena87","id":31543498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTQzNDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31543498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87","html_url":"https://github.com/DarioArena87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarioArena87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:GROOVY_3_0_X","ref":"GROOVY_3_0_X","sha":"1e0587b63f095be9337eb801aeff813831ed89ac","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache
