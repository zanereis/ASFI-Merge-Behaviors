to this commit, `nn.Module` generated the relax expression within the body of `relax.BlockBuilder.current()`.  For large models, this can result in extremely large function bodies, making it difficult to identify regions within the module.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds an option `nn.Module.define_subroutine`, which defaults to `False` (current behavior).  If set to `True`; either within a subclass, within an instance, or globally in `nn.Module`; function calls into the module will produce a subroutine representing the module's execution, and a call into that subroutine.  For example, calling a `class Linear(nn.Module)` would produce a `def linear(arg, weights)` function definition and a `module.linear(arg, weights)` function call.  To ensure correct shape propagation, a subroutine is generated for each unique set of argument shapes passed to the `nn.Module` subclass.\r\n\r\nThe PR branch contains three commits for ease of review.  The first commit extends `relax.BlockBuilder` to allow definitions to be generated while already making a function.  The second commit extends `nn.Module` to optionally generate and call subroutine functions.  The third commit adds backwards compatibility type checks to retain compatibility with [`mlc-ai`'s implementation of llama](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm/blob/main/mlc_llm/models/llama.py) when generating subroutines.","created_at":"2023-08-01T16:39:35Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T15:03:13Z","closed_at":"2023-08-07T15:03:06Z","merged_at":"2023-08-07T15:03:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a1af0c7007960eaf0a8ec39198e993304d82874","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5cdb18589bf2335c8c4601cf0a05edaccce61d4a","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_nn_module_subroutine","ref":"unity_nn_module_subroutine","sha":"5cdb18589bf2335c8c4601cf0a05edaccce61d4a","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR adds the `relax.op.erf` function. I added erf as a unary operator since it is arithmetic and elementwise, however, unlike other unary operators it requires some special handling. Specifically, we cast to fp32 from fp16 since it is not implemented on many devices for half precision.

In general subgroup on Intel GPU seems tricky, since unlike NV or AMD there is no well defined \"subgroup (warp) size\". Each instruction can execute with different subgroup sizes.  To disable shuffle instructions, we can add `-supported_subgroup_operations=0` to the target string. \r\n\r\nOverall, my experience with spirv shuffle instructions on AMD and Intel has not been good, and I have to say that this feature is only for an experimental purpose for now.

small PR improves how the onnx importer deals with ConstantOfShape. Previously we were creating constants that could be massive if the provided shape was large. This caused an explosion in the resulting model parameter size. Using `broadcast_to` instead provides behavior closer to the intention of the source graph.\r\n\r\nI also noticed relax now has `relax.op.image.resize2d` so i replaced our topi call with it which should help produce more readable output graphs.","created_at":"2023-07-28T19:45:21Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T15:24:06Z","closed_at":"2023-07-29T08:24:21Z","merged_at":"2023-07-29T08:24:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"7903ae1451cbe144e426b305e1232a6768fc650f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15434/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15434/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15434/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c42509ed012670b03d9b814ece880a0c0ed6feb2","head":{"label":"jwfromm:onnx_constant_of_shape_fix","ref":"onnx_constant_of_shape_fix","sha":"c42509ed012670b03d9b814ece880a0c0ed6feb2","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

a background info---the script parser works by visiting a \"statement\" (or top-level expression) at a time. The expression parts of the statement are evaluated, and then the IR corresponding to the statement is constructed if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn TIR, macro calls can only occur at the statement level, and they don't produce any values. This means that the statement visitor (`visit_expr_stmt`) can see these calls directly in its node parameter. At this point it could simply visit the body of the macro instead, which is the basis of the existing implementation.\r\n\r\nIn other dialects there may be a need for macros to produce values. This means that macro calls can occur in the middle of complex expressions. As a result, these calls will not be present at the statement level, and the TIR approach by intercepting them in `visit_expr_stmt` will no longer work. Instead, these macros delay the visiting of the macro body to the evaluation time. A macro is represented by an `ScriptMacro` (`TIRMacro` in the current implementation) object (created via macro decorator). When the evaluator evaluates an expression with a macro call, it will call the macro object (since macro calls use function call syntax). It is in the macro object's `__call__` function where the macro parsing picks up. The remaining issue was to pass the Parser object to the `__call__` function.

the python ansor tuning process, I found the root cause is:\r\nThe schedule attaches the stage 'T_softmax_exp' to the leaf IterVar 'i' of stage 'T_softmax_norm', but the stage 'T_softmax_exp' has two consumer stages, one is 'T_softmax_norm' and the other is 'T_softmax_expsum'. Inside `InferRootBound`, during the iteration when 'T_softmax_expsum' being processed, the attach path `Array<IterVar> stage_attach` is not empty, which belongs to 'T_softmax_norm', so the leaf IterVar of 'T_softmax_expsum' can not match the attach path and `found_attach` is evaluated to false, then the `ICHECK` raises an exception just as the error log shows above, and finally the exception is caught by `SketchPolicyNode::EvolutionarySearch`. The 'State' being filtered out is actually a valid one.\r\n\r\nBesides the annoying error logs, the consequence is `SketchPolicyNode::EvolutionarySearch` missed some potential good seeds, and the final schedule maybe not the best one.\r\n\r\nThe fix is rather simple, just check whether the current `op_stage` is the attached

Flax dependency `Orbax v0.1.8` has enforced the deprecation of installing Orbax as a standalone package. Flax v0.6.8 (which is currently pinned in the script `docker/install/ubuntu_install_jax.sh`) attempts to install Orbax as a standalone package and raises an error about doing so.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, the package `orbax-checkpoint` should be installed instead. Flax v0.6.8 does not recognise this and attempts to install Orbax instead of orbax-checkpoint and the installation fails.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve Jax installation issues, bumping the version of Flax to be at least 0.6.9, which resolves the problem. Flax >= 0.6.9 does not pin the version of orbax-checkpoint that it installs and the latest version requires Jax >= 0.4.9 to be installed so the two must be updated together.\r\n\r\nIssue:

PR introduces the warp-level shuffle primitives used in Metal Shading Language, and uses them in the implementation of allreduce lowering.\r\n\r\nThe introduced primitives are:\r\n* `simd_shuffle`,\r\n* `simd_shuffle_up`,\r\n* `simd_shuffle_down`.\r\n\r\nSee section 6.9.2 of https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Shading-Language-Specification.pdf for details.\r\n\r\nThe correctness are validated by `test_allreduce_cuda` with the backend changed to Metal. Given we do not have Metal CI tests, the correctness is checked only locally.\r\n\r\nGiven the Metal shuffle primitives do not support (or need) masking, the pass LowerThreadAllreduce is updated to support such backend which does not have masks. One unit test for metal is added to ensure that no mask is used.","created_at":"2023-07-25T07:54:34Z","updated_at":"2023-07-26T21:03:40Z","closed_at":"2023-07-26T21:03:40Z","merged_at":"2023-07-26T21:03:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"22ec541a6f12a6430246e4d3aed47c5cfc462b1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/fb416efefcb69a99f131f1342cc37adea9b7c3d5","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-07-25-metal-warp-level","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-07-25-metal-warp-level","sha":"fb416efefcb69a99f131f1342cc37adea9b7c3d5","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

#15327 and #15373 introduced multi-warp allreduce implementation. At the time of the introduction, I tested the correctness numerically via the workload of \"taking a matrix of ones as input, computing the summation over each row\". Both PR passed this numerical tess, while I didn't realize that this test is not complete and cannot guarantee the correctness.\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation has bug which can be tested by turning the input matrix from ones to random floating-point numbers. This will expose the issues of the previous implementation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR fixes the issues, and add the numerical tests for multi-warp allreduce into `test_allreduce_cuda.py`. By reducing some of the redundant tests in that file, we hope this can reduce the testing time a bit while still guarantee the correctness.\r\n\r\nSorry for not testing the implementation completely before.","created_at":"2023-07-25T06:49:00Z","updated_at":"2023-07-25T14:54:50Z","closed_at":"2023-07-25T14:54:50Z","merged_at":"2023-07-25T14:54:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"236eb31f09e998ade8bbb395cf6b9de1032dd9c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15399/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15399/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15399/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d7de7e080e93791215efe116e28ceae4948c3c91","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-07-24-allreduce-fix","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-07-24-allreduce-fix","sha":"d7de7e080e93791215efe116e28ceae4948c3c91","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

to this PR, the reduction dlight rule sometimes may over-normalizes the last block and removes some spatial loops, making the last block have fewer block iters than previous reduction blocks. In this case, the dlight rule is not able to apply due to assertion failure while it is supposed to apply.\r\n\r\nThis PR thus adds unit block iter to the last block when it has fewer iters than other reduction blocks in the front, so that the numbers of block iters can align.\r\n\r\nOne softmax unit test is added to ensure that dlight reduction rule can work.","created_at":"2023-07-21T21:42:25Z","updated_at":"2023-07-25T04:40:57Z","closed_at":"2023-07-25T04:40:56Z","merged_at":"2023-07-25T04:40:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"92668c7d0599b20d4da57d6cd4f1c561149e1472","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

PR introduces a new rule, especially for GEMV and decode-GEMV workloads. The current `DecodeGEMV` rule works for common reduction rules, so in this PR, we did the following renaming:\r\n1. `DecodeGEMV` -> `Reduction`\r\n2. `Reduction` -> `GeneralReduction`\r\n\r\nIn the future, we would refactor `Reduction` and `GeneralReduction` into one rule.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the performance of LLMs decoding stage improves:\r\n\r\n| Model | Platform | Before | After |\r\n|

FT kernel requires the output pointer type to be fp16, so we haven't supported offloading `matmul` with `out_dtype=\"float32\"`. But if such matmul is immediately followed by a cast to fp16, we can match and replace the whole `matmul -> cast` with the FT kernel. \r\n\r\nSuch case arises if a user wants to do fp32 accum during matmul. It turns out the FT kernel always does fp32 accumulation internally regardless of the output dtype, so we are not losing any precision by offloading `matmul(..., out_dtype = \"float32\") -> cast` to

PR fixes the predicate handling logic of the cross-thread reduction lowering pass.\r\n\r\nFor the cross-thread reduction write-back block, prior to this PR, its predicate is the conjunction of `t == 0` for each reduction thread dim of the cross-thread reduction. This is problematic when the write-back buffer is stored in local memory, where each thread is supposed to have a copy of the final value, while the final value is only stored by the first thread. In this PR, the predicate is changed to be the conjunction of the clauses from the two parts:\r\n\r\n* the clause of the original reduction block's predicate which contains spatial loop var,\r\n* `t == 0` for each reduction thread dim **only when the write-back buffer is global or shared**.\r\n\r\nSo the first part ensures that the write-back will not go out of bound, and the second part ensures that when the write-back buffer is local, every thread gets a value and when the write-back buffer is non-local, only one thread writes the value out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, this PR fixes the cross-thread broadcasting detection with the awareness of the storage scope of the write buffer of the broadcasting block. Specifically, for each consumer block of a buffer produced by cross-thread reduction under the same kernel (i.e., same set of `blockIdx`) of the cross-thread reduction block, when the write buffer of this consumer block is in local memory, we do not treat it as broadcasting, and will not add a predicate to it. Otherwise, we will add the predicate according to the broadcasting handling introduced by #15192.","created_at":"2023-07-21T05:55:02Z","updated_at":"2023-07-22T13:12:55Z","closed_at":"2023-07-22T13:12:55Z","merged_at":"2023-07-22T13:12:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f69ed43a8723e91abdbbc928a5826aa9461a953","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15374/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15374/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15374/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8a2dd01fd48ff7cc0de6243e57cf68e8aa7d26f0","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-07-20-crt-write-back-pred","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-07-20-crt-write-back-pred","sha":"8a2dd01fd48ff7cc0de6243e57cf68e8aa7d26f0","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

#15327 introduces the warp-level primitive support in multi-warp allreduce. However, due to the specialty of the two-stage shuffle-down reduction implementation of the allreduce in multi-warp scenarios, PR #15327 did not broadcast the allreduce result to each reduction thread. This behavior does not align with the semantics of allreduce and is not ideal for many use cases. Therefore, this PR completes the implementation by inserting a stage of writing the reduction results to shared memory, so that each reduction thread across all the reduction warps can access the reduction results.\r\n\r\nThis shared memory write-back stage will only be inserted in multi-warp allreduce cases. In single-warp allreduce, a `shfl_sync` is used to broadcast the reduction results across reduction threads. Since in multi-warp settings we cannot leverage warp-level primitives to broadcast the value, we can only make use of shared memory.\r\n\r\nThe numerical correctness are verified

the first step in proposal #15319, this PR adds a `call_tir_inplace` operator that is responsible for invoking `PrimFunc`s that perform in-place changes. Namely, this means that the `PrimFunc`s directly mutate an input and do not expect a freshly allocated output tensor like in a typical DPS style `call_tir` invocation.\r\n\r\n`call_tir_inplace` has the same signature as `call_tir`, except with one additional argument: `inplace_indices`, which lists an argument index (or -1) corresponding to each output of the `PrimFunc` call. Suppose there are `N` tensor arguments to `call_tir_inplace`. Then `inplace_indices` has the following property:\r\n1. If `inplace_indices[i] = j`, where `0 <= j < N`, then the `i`th output of the call will alias the `j`th argument. I.e., the `j`th argument is expected to be mutated in-place.\r\n2. If `inplace_indices[i] = -1`, then the `i`th output of the call will be a freshly allocated tensor. The `PrimFunc` will thus expect a newly allocated tensor corresponding to that output in the usual DPS style.\r\n\r\nNote that `call_tir_inplace` is treated as pure by the type system even though it is not, in fact, pure. This means that it is dangerous to call this operator directly! It is provided right now for testing purposes; in the future (per proposal #15319), these calls will be inserted only by passes that first verify that it is _safe_ to perform ops in-place. (We could discuss the phase ordering here; perhaps it will make more sense to simply perform the in-place lowering late in compilation, after getting rid of dataflow blocks.)","created_at":"2023-07-20T20:34:15Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T13:57:01Z","closed_at":"2023-07-31T13:57:00Z","merged_at":"2023-07-31T13:57:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"3727c048c63617a6e56bfb3597f781b76015400e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzh119","id":11773619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzczNjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11773619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119","html_url":"https://github.com/yzh119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzh119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

this is acceptable, I'll break it up into the TIR part and the Relax part, and create PRs in main and unity respectively.\r\n\r\nEdit: added description below\r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\nAs a background info---the parser (for either dialect, TIR or Relax) works by visiting a \"statement\" (or top-level expression) at a time.  The expression parts of the statement are evaluated, and then the IR corresponding to the statement is constructed if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn TIR, macro calls can only occur at the statement level, and they don't produce any values. This means that the statement visitor (`visit_expr_stmt`) can see these calls directly in its `node` parameter.  At this point it could simply visit the body of the macro instead, which is the basis of the existing implementation.\r\n\r\nIn Relax, on the other hand, there was a need for macros to produce values. This means that macro calls can occur in the middle of complex expressions.  As a result, these calls will not be present at the statement level, and the TIR approach by intercepting them in `visit_expr_stmt` will no longer work.  Instead, Relax macros delay the visiting of the macro body to the evaluation time.  A macro is represented by an `ScriptMacro` (`TIRMacro` in the current implementation) object (created via macro decorator).  When the evaluator evaluates an expression with a macro call, it will call the macro object (since macro calls use function call syntax).  It is in the macro object's `__call__` function where the macro parsing picks up.  The remaining issue was to pass the Parser object to the `__call__` function.  This is done by injecting it into the global dictionary under a reserved name.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the same approach also works for TIR, and the macro processing can be generalized, leaving only language-specific details to the language-specific language macro objects.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nRelax macros generate a `SeqExpr` containing the evaluated body of the macro.  A Relax macro should end with a `return` statement with the expression that will become the value of the macro.  A `return` is normally not allowed in a `SeqExpr`, so macro parsing intercepts it to get its argument, after which the `return` statement itself is discarded.  The argument is then set as the \"body\" of the `SeqExpr`.  Everything preceding the `return` becomes a binding block in the `SeqExpr`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import relax\r\nfrom tvm.script import relax as R\r\n\r\n@R.macro\r\ndef alloc_and_shape(dtype: str):\r\n    alloc = R.builtin.alloc_tensor(R.shape([4, 4]), runtime_device_index=0, dtype=dtype)\r\n    shape = R.shape_of(alloc)\r\n    return shape\r\n\r\n@R.function\r\ndef foo(x: R.Tensor((4, 4), \"float32\")):\r\n    shape = alloc_and_shape(dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    return shape\r\n\r\n\r\nprint(alloc_and_shape)\r\nprint()\r\nprint(foo)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@R.macro\r\ndef alloc_and_shape(dtype: str):\r\n    alloc = R.builtin.alloc_tensor(R.shape([4, 4]),

the dlight matmul schedule for the following case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmatmul(input, self.weight, out_dtype=\"float32\") + astype(self.bias, \"float32\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is the fp32 cast of bias. The current schedule doesn't recognize such \"independent block\" besides matmul, so this block hasn't been scheduled when dlight attempts to reverse-inline the \"last block\" (bias add) into the matmul cache-write stage via `auto_inline_consumers(sch, l2g)`. The bias add block ends up having two producers, which breaks `reverse_compute_inline` and hence leaving some blocks (the last block and the bias cast block) unscheduled for GPU.   \r\n\r\nThis has been fixed by checking if `reverse_compute_inline` has succeeded (no consumer remaining), and if not, look for unscheduled, \"independent\" producer blocks (like bias cast) and `compute_inline` them into the last block. Now the last block should only have one producer (cache-write), so doing `reverse_compute_inline` should now succeed.   \r\n\r\n@Hzfengsy

PR improves SimplifyClipAndConsecutiveCast pass in several aspects.\r\nFirst, it allows that the dtype of `clip` and the dtype of the last `cast` differ.\r\nSecond, it allows that there are arbitrary number of `cast` after `clip`. This is achieved via the recursion of patterns.\r\nBoth of the above two cases araise from the compilation of a prequantized model.\r\n\r\nSee the

function.","created_at":"2023-07-18T03:20:52Z","updated_at":"2023-07-18T16:50:01Z","closed_at":"2023-07-18T16:50:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e5926a27c0348eed5c3b78e1dd9cdb3ea358cc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

PR addresses the second issue in #15245. In particular, it handles the case that can arise when using `CanonicalizeBindings` of having a dataflow var whose only use is being bound to the output var, like so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef main() -> R.Tensor((), \"int32\"):\r\n        with R.dataflow():\r\n            y = R.const(1)\r\n            n = y\r\n            R.output(n)\r\n        return n\r\n```\r\nThe only use for `y` is to be bound to `n`, which is the `DataflowBlock`'s output.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces adds a pass called `FoldDataflowBlockOutput` that detects this case and eliminates the intermediate binding, leaving in this example simply this:\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef main() -> R.Tensor((), \"int32\"):\r\n    with R.dataflow():\r\n        n = R.const(1)\r\n

PR fixes a bug of DecodeGeMV dlight rule when the innermost tensor dimension is spatial with `unroll_factor` (for example, the grouping used in group quantization).\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, a reduction loop that is bound to threadIdx was reordered to reside outside a split spatial loop, which prevents the TIR LowerCrossThreadReduction pass to successfully apply due to some safety-guard requirement.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by not reordering the split spatial loop after the reduction loop, so that the pass can be applied. Note that we can do this as the order of thread-binding loops does not matter.","created_at":"2023-07-17T18:42:43Z","updated_at":"2023-07-18T00:39:55Z","closed_at":"2023-07-18T00:39:55Z","merged_at":"2023-07-18T00:39:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e1ff66fb3ba7072d644dd005eed9da61271e1df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

PR fixes two types of bugs:\r\nBug 1. fix a typo about the wrong API name in the test case.\r\nBug 2-5. add an assertion to reject the invalid model, which can be constructed in the old version of Keras. The attribute `units` in LSTM, RNN, GRU, and Dense must have a positive value. Such invalid values can be used to construct a DL model successfully and can be converted to RelayIR successfully. In this pr, we reject these invalid models containing such layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce to bug-2 about LSTM: (Keras <= 2.6)\r\n```\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport tvm.relay as relay\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom tensorflow import keras\r\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers, models\r\n\r\ninput_shape = (1, 2, 4)\r\ninput_data = np.random.random(size=input_shape)\r\ndtype = 'float32'\r\n\r\nx = layers.Input(shape=input_shape[1:], dtype=dtype)\r\n\r\nlayer = keras.layers.LSTM(units=0)        # invalid input but can not reject in keras <= 2.4\r\nlayer.set_weights(layer.get_weights())\r\n\r\ny = layer(x)\r\nmodel = models.Model(x, y)\r\nres_keras = model.predict(input_data)\r\n\r\nprint(model.summary())\r\nres_keras2 = model(input_data)\r\n\r\nshape_dict = {'input_1': input_shape}\r\nmod, params = relay.frontend.from_keras(model, shape_dict)\r\nprint(mod)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the latest version of Keras, the invalid value for units will be rejected. Thus, the test case can be triggered using the Keras <=2.4.\r\nThus, we cannot new test cases into the unit tests.\r\n\r\ncc @echuraev @leandron

to this PR, the matmul rule of dlight binds loops to `blockIdx.z`. However, not every device supports this blockIdx dimension (for example, WebGPU does not support `blockIdx.z`), which makes dlight fails to apply and build.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR fuses the

loop.","created_at":"2023-07-16T23:02:15Z","updated_at":"2023-07-17T09:59:47Z","closed_at":"2023-07-17T09:59:47Z","merged_at":"2023-07-17T09:59:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"66d3957d2ce692528d74bfd07e6eebac63afed7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

accurate device L2 cache size.\r\nI cannot find a Vulkan API that returns L2 texture cache size, but the `vkCmdPipelineBarrier` call will flush the L2 texture cache automatically(https://zeux.io/2020/02/27/writing-an-efficient-vulkan-renderer/), thus we return 0 by

PR fixes a bug of the previous decode-GeMV dlight scheduling.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when the inner dimension of the largest tensor is spatial, in the end the fused epilogue block was not bound to any thread axis, which is wrong and will generate wrong GPU code with wrong numerical results. That is because after doing reverse-compute-at of the epilogue block, there are at lease one remaining spatial axis, and such axis is supposed to be bound to threadIdx.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue, and add three test cases which can cover both the reduction-inner and spatial-inner cases with or without broadcasting.","created_at":"2023-07-16T05:48:10Z","updated_at":"2023-07-16T14:09:08Z","closed_at":"2023-07-16T14:09:08Z","merged_at":"2023-07-16T14:09:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf401bc6b4776033b09548187d88aa2297026cac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:
