checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-08T17:08:29Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T08:31:00Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T08:30:59Z","merged_at":"2019-09-16T08:30:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"dbb0a64a84d841f858cefbdaecae8bfe9f3788a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"lexburner","id":11485990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg1OTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11485990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner","html_url":"https://github.com/lexburner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lexburner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/38bf364b69212125d980e07f5027e41f9ead10a3","head":{"label":"Moriadry-zz:fix/stringtype","ref":"fix/stringtype","sha":"38bf364b69212125d980e07f5027e41f9ead10a3","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":181289431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODEyODk0MzE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

就能获取key的方法即可","created_at":"2019-09-06T07:21:48Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T03:00:23Z","closed_at":"2019-12-20T03:00:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a96c8f28596c339bf549ff3f22fd987be8fc022","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a3d48bd8945d9bf60b5e014d7151843402f0c840","head":{"label":"WZD-MI:feature/generic_optimize","ref":"feature/generic_optimize","sha":"a3d48bd8945d9bf60b5e014d7151843402f0c840","user":{"login":"WZD-MI","id":90900202,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjkwOTAwMjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90900202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI","html_url":"https://github.com/WZD-MI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140063016,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDAwNjMwMTY=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"WZD-MI/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WZD-MI","id":90900202,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjkwOTAwMjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90900202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI","html_url":"https://github.com/WZD-MI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WZD-MI/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WZD-MI/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

changelog\r\n\r\npom.xml\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nci pass \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-06T03:09:25Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T05:55:09Z","closed_at":"2019-09-17T12:45:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc1da51e60006837b513c2c9c51460a7903b3ad5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ae0729db8bf5013caa06f69f9798ac92b6ae1e47","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fixConfigCenterTimeout","ref":"fixConfigCenterTimeout","sha":"ae0729db8bf5013caa06f69f9798ac92b6ae1e47","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

we can increase thread model performance at least 25%. More work need to be done then.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-05T08:53:44Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T17:05:09Z","closed_at":"2019-11-19T17:05:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cbb80e9d6c63a459efe959a07b7ea2d52c8effe0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5013/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5013/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5013/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2ab670ed1807266bf0508d573087c2e238ffd149","head":{"label":"Moriadry-zz:feature/disruptor-test","ref":"feature/disruptor-test","sha":"2ab670ed1807266bf0508d573087c2e238ffd149","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":181289431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODEyODk0MzE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [X] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n已测试可以互相调用\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [✔️] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ✔️] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ✔️] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [✔️ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [✔️ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ✔️] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-30T15:05:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T07:01:34Z","closed_at":"2019-09-03T06:16:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8bd46df4aab91ca21b6069854c10c3d0bd5e4635","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4975/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4975/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4975/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b8a23534b8b4149182ae7d2743ac3ed92d818803","head":{"label":"lonre:fix_warning","ref":"fix_warning","sha":"b8a23534b8b4149182ae7d2743ac3ed92d818803","user":{"login":"lonre","id":181109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre","html_url":"https://github.com/lonre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":158160963,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTgxNjA5NjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"lonre/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lonre","id":181109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre","html_url":"https://github.com/lonre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lonre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lonre/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-30T14:13:55Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T22:20:44Z","closed_at":"2019-09-05T08:30:54Z","merged_at":"2019-09-05T08:30:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0327674c610dac69d65467f8810ccfc65997b8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4974/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4974/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4974/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2d3a9fe82e973a380c1296ecf3d0e3465289c5c8","head":{"label":"charish00:master","ref":"master","sha":"2d3a9fe82e973a380c1296ecf3d0e3465289c5c8","user":{"login":"charish00","id":9687323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODczMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9687323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00","html_url":"https://github.com/charish00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203532094,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDM1MzIwOTQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"charish00/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"charish00","id":9687323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODczMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9687323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00","html_url":"https://github.com/charish00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charish00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/charish00/dubbo","description":"Apache

operations\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nci\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

client\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-27T12:29:32Z","updated_at":"2019-09-02T09:59:53Z","closed_at":"2019-09-02T09:59:52Z","merged_at":"2019-09-02T09:59:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"19624840541ccbeddca52d87e189507844d453b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0ffc66b300d83f5cf82d0f143288f2b21694db8b","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue4898","ref":"issue4898","sha":"0ffc66b300d83f5cf82d0f143288f2b21694db8b","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"98c46777581be7c8e6df18c6a3e55d3c470e19b4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-22T09:28:19Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T07:10:43Z","closed_at":"2019-08-27T07:10:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f0ebbe5d77a6fed079ccd5385493b4002849ebd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c27b789f1d0dad5c105f166895d914895ec33619","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:rest_attachment","ref":"rest_attachment","sha":"c27b789f1d0dad5c105f166895d914895ec33619","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n+ [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n+ [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n+ [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n+ [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-21T02:52:45Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T13:49:27Z","closed_at":"2019-12-19T13:49:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8004a10612bbd58bd06757b9590ac7d1cc526db5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7331964,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzMxOTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Bugs

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-20T04:29:35Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T04:21:04Z","closed_at":"2019-12-09T04:21:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"020c4bcc5b742074f5b022f7efb48ad24b050357","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4891/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4891/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4891/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f39a0151737b19c1be34a5aed249fc5a8548752b","head":{"label":"chickenlj:deserialization-security","ref":"deserialization-security","sha":"f39a0151737b19c1be34a5aed249fc5a8548752b","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-19T18:13:13Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T06:44:26Z","closed_at":"2019-08-20T06:44:26Z","merged_at":"2019-08-20T06:44:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"dfa6eb914bc2973ad25f9ed56578b28bba822d62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/90f5a568970d90814720859ded9f0b1c1ad10f40","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:loadbalance_getweight","ref":"loadbalance_getweight","sha":"90f5a568970d90814720859ded9f0b1c1ad10f40","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-19T13:37:35Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T02:16:51Z","closed_at":"2019-08-20T02:16:51Z","merged_at":"2019-08-20T02:16:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"594e4e156730da0ec912d4f05883ca76eecf005e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4884/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4884/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4884/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/217a55c2d065b6ffee8ebc4b33253effcb6115d1","head":{"label":"beiwei30:optimize-travis","ref":"optimize-travis","sha":"217a55c2d065b6ffee8ebc4b33253effcb6115d1","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a025cc1446d38e8a195d23c59f81cb3e02f22769","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-19T08:22:43Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T08:47:42Z","closed_at":"2019-08-19T08:35:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f368d3a895aae5510b1fbc446c85d903f0a9dab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4876/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4876/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4876/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d41607fa5b42803a5a40a88a77c18d75899f757e","head":{"label":"pandaclj:master","ref":"master","sha":"d41607fa5b42803a5a40a88a77c18d75899f757e","user":{"login":"pandaclj","id":20837319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODM3MzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20837319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj","html_url":"https://github.com/pandaclj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166771320,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjY3NzEzMjA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"pandaclj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pandaclj","id":20837319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODM3MzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20837319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj","html_url":"https://github.com/pandaclj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaclj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pandaclj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-19T08:03:29Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T01:17:40Z","closed_at":"2019-08-20T01:17:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"541710c22c712f38ee46005f5a4d70fd920336cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4874/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4874/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4874/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/21029bae994e6b4010888e61d3d93fc59c3aba27","head":{"label":"kexianjun:fix-4871","ref":"fix-4871","sha":"21029bae994e6b4010888e61d3d93fc59c3aba27","user":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145399297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUzOTkyOTc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kexianjun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-16T12:43:49Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T06:33:17Z","closed_at":"2019-08-20T06:33:17Z","merged_at":"2019-08-20T06:33:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"d7e2ef42b98a80993da7044082c966d4e45f3140","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4859/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4859/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4859/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9db12a1d8e73505e39f7c487663c32022ac89311","head":{"label":"luryson:master","ref":"master","sha":"9db12a1d8e73505e39f7c487663c32022ac89311","user":{"login":"luryson","id":7643503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDM1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7643503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson","html_url":"https://github.com/luryson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182269059,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODIyNjkwNTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"luryson/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luryson","id":7643503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDM1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7643503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson","html_url":"https://github.com/luryson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luryson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luryson/dubbo","description":"Apache
