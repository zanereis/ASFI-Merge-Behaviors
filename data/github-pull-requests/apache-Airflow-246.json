reverts commit d553813b0c35f212b2fa10a49e6a542d23e5ee83.\r\n\r\nAfter few reviews, I think the description check is counter-productive. There are many commits\r\nthat might not require it and it's not obvious how it should be fixed. I prefer to judge manually if\r\nmore description is needed. Also we might quickly end up with bogus descriptions such as copying the title to description which is worse than not having the description.\r\n\r\nAlso - I think what's really important if we want to enforce description - Then we need to make sure that description is OK in the final commit rather than in PR description. \r\n\r\nNote that PR description is not synchronised after PR is created, so if you create PR with an empty description, you have to update both description in the PR and the commit to get the desired result!\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6596](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6596)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

change allows Airflow users to utilise their own custom Statsd client as discussed [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6530).\r\n\r\nMany companies have their own custom Statsd clients and this change should allow for easier adoption of Airflow by large corporations.\r\n\r\nExample usage based off of this change:\r\n\r\n1) User adds a module path to their airflow.cfg file next to the 'statsd_custom_client_path' key in the scheduler section of the config.\r\n\r\nAs such:\r\n`statsd_custom_client_path = company.statsdclient.customclient`\r\n\r\n2) Ensure the newly added client exists on the PYTHONPATH.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6530](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6530)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n-

is a second attempt to add Singularity Container support to Apache Airflow by way of Singularity Python. I am using the previously created JIRA ticket 4030 (created in March 2019) as it is still relevant. I am a new contributor and largely not familiar with the community here (and yes I've read the guidelines) so I would appreciate support and kindness from the individuals that act as maintainers here, and any additional support from other folks that are also interested in this integration.

PR moves some documentation within the UPDATING.md file to be tied to the appropriate versions for said changes. When we were migrating to 1.10.7 from 1.10.6 we were confused by which changes had been shipped with the most recent version. I went through all of the changes under `Airflow Master` in the file and tied the issues back to the changelog found here: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/changelog.html. Those that were not present in the changelog under a specific version were left in `Airflow Master`, but those that were present in a version were relocated to that version.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: `Document only change, no JIRA issue`\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [X] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

contains changes in pool and task instance to provide functionality to tasks to use more than one pool slot.\r\n\r\n- Added pool_capacity field in TaskInstance (pool_capacity is defaulted to 1, to maintain the current behavior)\r\n- Added pool_capacity in baseoperator\r\n- Modified pools functionality to calculate the used/queued/occupied/available slots\r\n- Modified pool_slots_available_dep.py to check against task _pool_capacity_ field instead of 1 \r\n- Modifed test case in file test_pool_slots_available_dep.py to include pool_capacity in the Mock

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6585\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWhen using the KubernetesPodOperator on an aws kubernetes cluster, the aws-iam-authenticator is used to obtain kubernetes authentication tokens. The aws tokens contain ISO-8601 formatted timestamps, which couldn't be parsed in case of a \"Z\" (Zulu Time) timezone. This PR fixes this problem by converting the \"Z\" timezone into a regular \"+0000\" format.\r\n\r\nUpon further review this is only a problem with python version <= 3.6. But that should not keep the issue from being fixed.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-13T14:11:34Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T09:49:30Z","closed_at":"2020-09-11T03:39:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfc9a2658b81500f80f9bbb9cd2034c226ebea41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

know that this is a very large PR, but unfortunately, it is not possible to divide it, because these classes are very close together on the lists in `test_core_to_contrib.py` file, documentation and others. \r\n\r\nIf we don't do it in bulk, we will constantly fight merge conflicts and AIP-21 will not be finalized in the next six months (100+ integration * 1.5 day =150 days, 150 days / (5 / 7) [exclusion of weekends] = 210 days,  210 days = 6.89 month = 0.57 year). \r\n\r\nIn fact, it would probably be a shorter time, but it is still very hard work for one person. That would also be problematic for other people because Travis would be busy.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nKamil\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6539](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6539/)\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [X] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

“end of log” marker does not include the primary key of the logs: log_id. The issue is then airflow-web does not know when to stop tailing the logs. \r\nWe print the end of log marker using handler emit() method that adds the dag_id, task_id, execution_date and try_number into the log records.

would like to be able to configure certain tasks to retry, but to also have a way to bypass retry if I can detect a condition that is unlikely to be change for the better.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine I have a DAG with a large number of tasks that fetch data from an API ... sometimes the API returns a 200 and everything is fine, sometimes the API returns a 500 and I know this means that API is failing under load and I want to retry later, and sometimes the API returns a 400 indicating that I've configured my requests in a way that will never succeed. If the API returns a 400 for some/all of my tasks, then I have to wait for all of them to get through all their retries before the run fails.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to add another subclass of AirflowException called AirflowFailException, and to update the exception handling in TaskInstance.run_raw_task such that when this exception is seen, the resulting behavior is that same as if we entered handle_failure and is_eligible_for_returned false (except with adjusted logging so it does not look like we simply hit our retry limit). \r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6535)\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

'SchedulerJob._execute.<locals>.processor_factory'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is scheduler try to run subprocesses using multiprocessing with spawn mode and the mode tries to pickle objects. In this case, `processor_factory` inner method is tried to be pickled.\r\nActually, as of Python 3.8, spawn mode is the default mode in macOS.\r\n\r\nThe solution I propose is that pull the method out of the enclosing method.\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6529)\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.
