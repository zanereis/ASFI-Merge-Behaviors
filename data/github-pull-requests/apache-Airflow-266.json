For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4146\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n1. CgroupTaskRunner import errors is fixed in this PR.\r\n2. Node.name() is encoded but it works fine in python2. However, python3 returns False for `'abc' = b'abc'`. We have to decode it since python2 support has been dropped in this project.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n1. Add test to ensure that `CgroupTaskRunner._init_()` method calls `super()._init_` to initiate CgroupTaskRunner object.\r\n2. Add test to ensure that when task finishes, `CgroupTaskRunner.on_finish()` will call `super().on_finish()` to delete the temp cfg file.\r\n3. import errors will be captured as well.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - [AIRFLOW-4450](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4450)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - The initial bug discovered was that in the 1.10.3 update, we saw that non-admin users who had permission to clear task instances were no longer able to do so.\r\n  - An unintentional side effect of [AIRFLOW-4240 #5039] broke has_dag_access so that it does not always receive the correct request arguments from form parameters passed in through the POST endpoints. The change here merges arguments from request.args and request.form before continuing.\r\n  - This change was made on the Airflow instance I'm running and confirmed to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - No existing unit tests for any of the decorators; no proper test identified for this case.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4447\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n![Snip20190430_31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8662365/57001399-56993800-6b6d-11e9-9016-0bec758aefc1.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8662365/56993473-630f9780-6b51-11e9-8df0-5d3c0d7c8d69.png)\r\n![Snip20190430_32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8662365/57001409-657fea80-6b6d-11e9-920d-e94dd17424cf.png)\r\n\r\nAs for the `Task Duration` and `Landing Times`, since they are charts, it makes sense to show as whatever the number in y axis.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4444)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR is currently a WIP, but establishes the core changes that are being proposed.\r\n - Executor events are being re-termed as ghosts (to keep in line with the zombies nomenclature). Ghosts are events that are recorded as QUEUED in the DB, but executor has marked them as finished.\r\n - Ghosts are stateful if discovered using the event buffer, and hence need to be handled sequentially and aggressively. Ghosts can be stateless if discovered using the DB first, and then mapped against executor directly.\r\n - If the discovery is stateless, then we can defer the handling of ghosts, and push them just like zombies to the `DagFileProcessor` instances for handling.\r\n\r\nMain changes :\r\n - Ghosts will be discovered in a single query in a scheduler heartbeat. (previously it was a single query per ghost)\r\n - Ghosts will be lazily handled when the DAG is eventually parsed again by the processors.\r\n - Ghosts won't appear individually inside the logs as executor events, they will appear as zombies instead.\r\n - Each DAG is guaranteed to be parsed only once per loop.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an important concern for us as we see Scheduler loops sometimes exceed 100s if there is a big accumulation of executor events.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTODO, will add next.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-30T18:31:05Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T15:26:50Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T15:26:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63177be1b6fdd5cba8378834db2f62672d4c6da8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\n\n### Jira\n\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4419\n\n### Description\n\n- [x] These were removed in #5194 but were still used in the UI and are helpful for observability of Ariflow, so I've added them back.\n\n  /cc @feng-tao @KevinYang21\n\n### Tests\n\n- [x] Added a simple test to the PoolModelView to ensure the expected links are there.\n\n  I haven't tested the behaviour of the used/queued slots as they are simple enough functions\n\n### Commits\n\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira #4434](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4434) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n-  [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI've introduced this PR to allow users the option to avoid running set variables for the hive hook. My initial motivation was to un-break impala support (broken via https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3405 ) but decided to write the PR in this way so that users could disable the set statements for hive (or other systems accessed through the hive hook) as well.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of the fix I don't think they're needed but perhaps the maintainers feel differently.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4401\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt is a known problem https://bugs.python.org/issue23582 that\r\nmultiprocessing.Queue empty() method is not reliable - sometimes it might\r\nreturn True even if another process already put something in the queue.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in some of the tasks not picked up when sync() methods\r\nwere called (in AirflowKubernetesScheduler, LocalExecutor,\r\nDagFileProcessor). This was less of a problem if the method was called in sync()\r\n- as the remaining jobs/files could be processed in next pass but it was a problem\r\nin tests and when graceful shutdown was executed (some tasks could be still\r\nunprocessed while the shutdown occured).\r\n\r\nWe switched to Managers() managed queues to handle that - the queue in this case\r\nis run in a separate subprocess and each process using it uses a proxy to access\r\nthis shared queue.\r\n\r\nAll the cases impacted follow the same pattern now:\r\n\r\nwhile not queue.empty():\r\n   res = queue.get()\r\n   ....\r\n\r\nThis loop runs always in single (main) process so it is safe to run it this way -\r\nthere is no risk that some other process will retrieve the data from the queue in\r\nbetween empty() and get().\r\n\r\nIn all these cases overhead for inter-processing locking is negligible\r\ncomparing to the action executed (Parsing DAG, executing job)\r\nso it appears it should be safe to merge the change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests were there (but flaky)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-28T16:06:10Z","updated_at":"2019-04-30T10:21:23Z","closed_at":"2019-04-30T09:50:59Z","merged_at":"2019-04-30T09:50:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"6952b196863aeb50632656bb4004129159ff573e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/aa16653349e1fa6301c272cd307a3a88dc51e786","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:fix_queues_with_managers","ref":"fix_queues_with_managers","sha":"aa16653349e1fa6301c272cd307a3a88dc51e786","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4401\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt is a known problem https://bugs.python.org/issue23582 that\r\nmultiprocessing.Queue empty() method is not reliable - sometimes it might\r\nreturn True even if another process already put something in the queue.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in some of the tasks not picked up when sync() methods\r\nwere called (in AirflowKubernetesScheduler, LocalExecutor,\r\nDagFileProcessor). This was less of a problem if the method was called in sync()\r\n- as the remaining jobs/files could be processed in next pass but it was a problem\r\nin tests and when graceful shutdown was executed (some tasks could be still\r\nunprocessed while the shutdown occured).\r\n\r\nAll the cases impacted follow the same pattern now:\r\n\r\nwhile not queue.empty():\r\n   res = queue.get()\r\n   ....\r\n\r\nThis loop runs always in single (main) process so it is safe to run it this way -\r\nthere is no risk that some other process will retrieve the data from the queue in\r\nbetween empty() and get().\r\n\r\nNote that unlike in the standard multiprocessing.Queue, you cannot rely\r\non data being immediately available after empty() is False. You should be\r\nprepared that subsequent get_nowait() raises Empty, or (better) use get()\r\nto retrieve the data.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases overhead for inter-processing locking is negligible\r\ncomparing to the action executed (Parsing DAG, executing job)\r\nso it appears it should be safe to merge the change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo need. Lots of tests for that already (flaky ones).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4419) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n* Optimized the pool, dag and task concurrency calculation logic to make it faster. Also fix a BUG where current task concurrency should not increase if the executor already has the task.\r\n\r\n* Added helper method in pool.py to access default pool size and optimized open slot querying method fo r performance.\r\n\r\n* **Behavior change:** Previously scheduler will schedule at most `non_pooled_task_slot_count` non-pooled tasks per scheduler loop. After this change, scheduler will schedule at most `non_pooled_task_slot_count` non-pooled tasks in total.\r\n  * I think this is a more intuitive interpretation of the config according to [its comment](https://github.com/KevinYang21/incubator-airflow/blob/kevin_yang_4419/airflow/config_templates/default_airflow.cfg#L121-L122).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n* Update `tests.test_jobs:SchedulerJobTest.test_find_executable_task_instances_task_concurrency` to include the use case for the BUG.\r\n* Added `tests.models.test_pool:PoolTest`.\r\n* Added `tests.test_jobs:SchedulerJobTest.test_find_executable_task_instances_in_non_pool`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4418\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdd an  **Failed** option to task modal:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47340368/56988044-f17d1c80-6b43-11e9-942a-d7fcf06844e9.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47340368/56988071-0194fc00-6b44-11e9-84e8-58835566349f.png)\r\n\r\nThe **Failed** option only considers failed tasks when clearing. This may be useful if you have downstream tasks that are both in the success and failed state, but only want to clear the failed ones.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example DAG:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47340368/56988019-e0cca680-6b43-11e9-98b2-fdba7e4b11ec.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47340368/56988153-330dc780-6b44-11e9-8ffd-6b9e415c719c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47340368/56988164-3903a880-6b44-11e9-9a62-ba8436f2a3c8.png)\r\n\r\nBy default, if we clear the top level task, we should see this, where we are clearing both successful and failed tasks:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47340368/56988193-4ae54b80-6b44-11e9-8741-4657a487e8a4.png)\r\n\r\nNow if we checking the **Failed** button, we should only see and clear failed tasks:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47340368/56988224-605a7580-6b44-11e9-9bc3-2615ac5f4a79.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nJust adding a route that is similar to an existing route (/dagrun_clear) and a button to the UI that ultimately calls the clear method of the DAG class, which is already tested.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4416\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe fix implemented as part of AIRFLOW-4401 might have some adverse side effects.\r\n\r\nFor example it very likely caused the build to stall: https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/524771374/log.txt\r\nThe root cause is know, but the fix need to be tested more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nI think it's safer to revert the fix for now and invest more time in finding more robust fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo need.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

temp fix was remove after 1.8.0 due to  https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2195\r\n\r\nin the latest branch, a new trigger rule is added.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4182\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIssue: skip status stop propagation to down streams and get randomly stopped with the dag status marked as failed.\r\nThe issue is located in the version 1.8.1.\r\nIn version 1.8.0 there is a temp fix but removed after this version.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/4077c6de297566a4c598065867a9a27324ae6eb1\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/92965e8275c6f2ec2282ad46c09950bab10c1cb2\r\n\r\n\r\nroot casue:\r\n  In a loop, the scheduler evaluates each dag and all its task dependcies around by around.\r\n  Each round evaluation happens twice in the context of flag_upstream_failed = false and =true.\r\n\r\n  The dag run update method mark the dag run deadlocked which stops the dag and all its tasks from be processed furture.\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/models.py#L4184\r\n  It is due to in no_dependencies_met.  All_sccucess trigger rule misses skipped status check and marks the task as failed when upstream only has skipped tasks.\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/models.py#L4152\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/ti_deps/deps/trigger_rule_dep.py#L165\r\n\r\n  Each dag update will checks all its task deps and sent ready tasks to run in the context of flag_upstream_failed=false (defalt)\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/models.py#L4156   which wont handle skip status propagation.\r\n\r\n  After dag update, dag will checks all its task deps and sent ready tasks to run in the context of flag_upstream_failed=true\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/jobs.py#L904\r\n  which handles skip status propogration.\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/ti_deps/deps/trigger_rule_dep.py#L138\r\n\r\n  Two potential causes that will trigger dag update detect a deadlock.\r\n  The skip status proprogatation rely on detected skipped upstreams (which happens asyncly by other nodes writing skipped status to db).\r\n  If the tasks been evaluated  are not following topoloy order(random order) by priority_weigth. It requried multipe loop rounds to propogate skip statue to all downsteam tasks.\r\n  Depending on how close the topoloy order the tasks fetched, the proprogation may go further or shorter.\r\n\r\n  The deadlock detetion can be avoid only the following  conditions happen at the same time:\r\n  1. the skip task (shortcurit operation async process) update db with skip task status, right after dag update (flag_upstream_failed=false )before dag task checks(flag_upstream_failed=true) in scheduler process.\r\n  2. dag checks(flag_upstream_failed=true) have all tasks fetched/evaluated in the topology order that skip status can propogate in one evaluations round.\r\n\r\n\r\nFix approaches:\r\n\r\n1) Mark the ALL_sucess trigger rule : num_failures = upstream - successes - skipped.\r\n   It will prevent the deadlock detectoin from being triggered. If the tasks are not ordered, mulitple rounds are required and will eventually mark all of the tasked as skipped. Or add an additional trigger rule. That is https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4182 and make it as the default trigger rule.\r\n\r\n2) Ordered tasks by topopy order to speed speedup skip status propogation in one round of evaluation.\r\n   https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/jobs.py#L893\r\n   tis = sorted(tis, key=lambda x: x.priority_weight, reverse=True)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

1.8.0 due to  https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/2195\r\n\r\nin the latest branch, a new trigger rule is added.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4182\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIssue: skip status stop propagation to down streams and get randomly stopped with the dag status marked as failed.\r\nThe issue is located in the version 1.8.1.\r\nIn version 1.8.0 there is a temp fix but removed after this version.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/4077c6de297566a4c598065867a9a27324ae6eb1\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/92965e8275c6f2ec2282ad46c09950bab10c1cb2\r\n\r\n\r\nroot casue:\r\n  In a loop, the scheduler evaluates each dag and all its task dependcies around by around.\r\n  Each round evaluation happens twice in the context of flag_upstream_failed = false and =true.\r\n\r\n  The dag run update method mark the dag run deadlocked which stops the dag and all its tasks from be processed furture.\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/models.py#L4184\r\n  It is due to in no_dependencies_met.  All_sccucess trigger rule misses skipped status check and marks the task as failed when upstream only has skipped tasks.\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/models.py#L4152\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/ti_deps/deps/trigger_rule_dep.py#L165\r\n\r\n  Each dag update will checks all its task deps and sent ready tasks to run in the context of flag_upstream_failed=false (defalt)\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/models.py#L4156   which wont handle skip status propagation.\r\n\r\n  After dag update, dag will checks all its task deps and sent ready tasks to run in the context of flag_upstream_failed=true\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/jobs.py#L904\r\n  which handles skip status propogration.\r\n  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/ti_deps/deps/trigger_rule_dep.py#L138\r\n\r\n  Two potential causes that will trigger dag update detect a deadlock.\r\n  The skip status proprogatation rely on detected skipped upstreams (which happens asyncly by other nodes writing skipped status to db).\r\n  If the tasks been evaluated  are not following topoloy order(random order) by priority_weigth. It requried multipe loop rounds to propogate skip statue to all downsteam tasks.\r\n  Depending on how close the topoloy order the tasks fetched, the proprogation may go further or shorter.\r\n\r\n  The deadlock detetion can be avoid only the following  conditions happen at the same time:\r\n  1. the skip task (shortcurit operation async process) update db with skip task status, right after dag update (flag_upstream_failed=false )before dag task checks(flag_upstream_failed=true) in scheduler process.\r\n  2. dag checks(flag_upstream_failed=true) have all tasks fetched/evaluated in the topology order that skip status can propogate in one evaluations round.\r\n\r\n\r\nFix approaches:\r\n\r\n1) Mark the ALL_sucess trigger rule : num_failures = upstream - successes - skipped.\r\n   It will prevent the deadlock detectoin from being triggered. If the tasks are not ordered, mulitple rounds are required and will eventually mark all of the tasked as skipped. Or add an additional trigger rule. That is https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4182 and make it as the default trigger rule.\r\n\r\n2) Ordered tasks by topopy order to speed speedup skip status propogation in one round of evaluation.\r\n   https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.1/airflow/jobs.py#L893\r\n   tis = sorted(tis, key=lambda x: x.priority_weight, reverse=True)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4414\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n* Currently it is not possible to make use of QueryExecutionID (the\r\n  unique identifier of the query submitted to Athena) in the tasks that\r\n  follow.\r\n\r\n* This commit changes the situation by making sure QueryExecutionID gets\r\n  pushed to XCom when BaseOperator.do_xcom_push is set to True.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThere currently does not seem to exist a simple way of testing XCom pushing of Operators.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n\r\n@XD-DENG, could you

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4409) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4409\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAirflow DAG UI has a view \"task duration\". Due to our recent migration. There are some records in the task_fail table which has null duration (caused by missing start date). This is affecting the UI view of task duration. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSmall change without changing logic. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\n\n### Jira\n\n- [x]\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3449\n\n### Description\n\n- [x] The default \"processor\" handler is a FileProcessorHandler (compare to\n  FileTaskHandler as the default \"task\" handler) so setting this as a\n  subclass of FileTaskHandler ended up with an invalid path for the\n  processor logs, meaning they never got written to a file when remote\n  logging is enabled.\n\n  This was likely a mis-configuration introduced in #2793\n\n### Tests\n\n- [x] Just removing a config change, not worth testing.\n\n### Commits\n\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] No Jira\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] The change I introduced in #5158 caused this sensor test to keep poking\r\nin a busy loop, resulting in about **4k** lines to the logs

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis article describes how to **create** new operators. It has been placed in the section describing how to **use** operators. This can be confusing. I cleaned up the section on using operators earlier and I would not want to see a mess there. There is currently no good place to put this article, so i put him in this place temporarily. In the future this article may have been moved as part of the work of the [\"Season of Docs 2019\"](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Season+of+Docs+2019) project\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4401\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt solves unreliable behaviour of multiprocessing.Queue.empty() - sometimes returning True when the queue is not really empty.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nWe already have LocalExecutor and other tests that will just become less flaky.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following:\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4396\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR adds a new button to the Airflow UI next to \"View log\" (\"View log in ES\"). It provides an external URL for visualizing the log, and renders the latest try for the Task, DAG and execution being looked up. This button is controlled by a new `elasticsearch_frontend` conf param, which provides the template URL for viewing the corresponding log. Screenshot below :\r\n\r\nUI without frontend provided:\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-05-03 at 2 37 50 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5075200/57167115-6f922b00-6db1-11e9-9548-565afdb36243.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the UI when a frontend is provided:\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-05-03 at 2 39 40 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5075200/57167119-71f48500-6db1-11e9-8630-4e52e5814758.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation update is pending code review. Will update documentation after.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tested the UI and checked the console for errors in the JS. Button doesn't show up if the param is not defined.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-23T22:02:10Z","updated_at":"2019-06-06T12:25:06Z","closed_at":"2019-05-20T07:03:00Z","merged_at":"2019-05-20T07:03:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"52a9d4e16c3ed73588c66f0b98fa6d1942587cac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5164/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5164/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5164/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b599d8bd6aad6dd83de8d86626e5e157c0175b13","head":{"label":"kunalyogenshah:kunal_add_es_logs","ref":"kunal_add_es_logs","sha":"b599d8bd6aad6dd83de8d86626e5e157c0175b13","user":{"login":"kunalyogenshah","id":5075200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzUyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5075200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah","html_url":"https://github.com/kunalyogenshah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182314380,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODIzMTQzODA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kunalyogenshah/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kunalyogenshah","id":5075200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzUyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5075200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah","html_url":"https://github.com/kunalyogenshah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kunalyogenshah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kunalyogenshah/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\n\n### Jira\n\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4358\n\n### Description\n\n- [x] We don't care about the behaviour of the tasks (we test those elsewhere) - we just care that the task is \"run\" and yeilds a state, which we can all do more directly.\n\n  On my laptop this takes the time for SchedulerJobTest from 133s to 35s, and reduces the BackfillJobTests from >5mins to mere seconds!\n\n  I think this approach still tests the behaviour well enough\n\n### Tests\n\n- [x] Changed tests to check events that are run via executor, but it won't run it\n\n### Commits\n\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-4395\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4395\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs for me, this view is not currently used in the project. \r\nThe view was introduced in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/300951c23ac079e13101c6dd11d6e42b60912ebb\r\nbut it does not contain references in UI.\r\nThis is a development tool that can be added using a plugin when someone misses this feature.\r\nWhy is it important to delete unused views? Security.  In this case, it's unlikely, but it's better to clean up. The future is unknown.\r\nExample: https://sekurak.pl/jak-wyciekac-dane-to-w-setkach-milionow-zupelnie-niezabezpieczone-api-dostepne-przez-kilka-lat/ (hole in unused old API)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-23T16:26:50Z","updated_at":"2019-05-19T14:06:48Z","closed_at":"2019-05-19T14:06:48Z","merged_at":"2019-05-19T14:06:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d79fd5f73987aef703aa7a7858fb42413fc994b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5161/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5161/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5161/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/78ab648fe00e7978f14e0d3ac01cc4b92aee7a85","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:remove_pickle_info_view","ref":"remove_pickle_info_view","sha":"78ab648fe00e7978f14e0d3ac01cc4b92aee7a85","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

All we need to\n  test is that we call `dag.run()` correctly. Mocking ftw.\n\n\n### Tests\n\n- [x] Extended (and moved) existing tests\n\n### Commits\n\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- [x] Passes

[x] No Jira\n\n### Description\n\n- [x] Flake8 is based upon pycodestyle, and so is pyflakes which my editor\n  uses (as it is less stringent but _much_ quicker). To support checkers\n  simultaneously define the settings against pycodestlye so that both\n  tools can pick them up.\n\n  I have tested that flake8 does pick up these settings - if it didn't we\n  would have a bunch of errors showing back up\n\n### Tests\n\n- [x] Existing tests still pass\n\n### Commits\n\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-4360](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4360) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR extends Statsd usage for tracking webserver metrics as well. For starters, we track: \r\n1) Log page hits, and log fetching latency + failures.\r\n2) Tree view and graph view latency + load failures.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nOnce enabled, you can see the following new counters in Statsd :\r\n```\r\n{ counters:\r\n   { 'statsd.bad_lines_seen': 0,\r\n     'statsd.packets_received': 68,\r\n     'statsd.metrics_received': 68,\r\n     'airflow.scheduler_heartbeat': 2,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.tree_view.views': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.tree_view.load_failures': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.graph_view.views': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.graph_view.load_failures': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.log.views': 1,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.log.load_failures': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.ajax_logs_fetch.load_failures': 0 },\r\n  timers:\r\n   { 'airflow.webserver.tree_view.load_time': [],\r\n     'airflow.webserver.graph_view.load_time': [],\r\n     'airflow.webserver.ajax_logs_fetch.load_time': [ 17.852 ] },\r\n  gauges:\r\n   { 'airflow.collect_dags': 0.046903,\r\n     'airflow.dagbag_size': 1,\r\n     'airflow.dagbag_import_errors': 0,\r\n     'statsd.timestamp_lag': 0,\r\n     'airflow.pool.starving_tasks.not_pooled': 0 },\r\n  timer_data:\r\n   { 'airflow.webserver.tree_view.load_time': { count_ps: 0, count: 0 },\r\n     'airflow.webserver.graph_view.load_time': { count_ps: 0, count: 0 },\r\n     'airflow.webserver.ajax_logs_fetch.load_time':\r\n      { count_90: 1,\r\n        mean_90: 17.852,\r\n        upper_90: 17.852,\r\n        sum_90: 17.852,\r\n        sum_squares_90: 318.69390400000003,\r\n        std: 0,\r\n        upper: 17.852,\r\n        lower: 17.852,\r\n        count: 1,\r\n        count_ps: 0.1,\r\n        sum: 17.852,\r\n        sum_squares: 318.69390400000003,\r\n        mean: 17.852,\r\n        median: 17.852 } },\r\n  counter_rates:\r\n   { 'statsd.bad_lines_seen': 0,\r\n     'statsd.packets_received': 6.8,\r\n     'statsd.metrics_received': 6.8,\r\n     'airflow.scheduler_heartbeat': 0.2,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.tree_view.views': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.tree_view.load_failures': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.graph_view.views': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.graph_view.load_failures': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.log.views': 0.1,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.log.load_failures': 0,\r\n     'airflow.webserver.ajax_logs_fetch.load_failures': 0 },\r\n  sets: {},\r\n  pctThreshold: [ 90 ] }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-19T19:24:08Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T01:00:42Z","closed_at":"2020-01-26T01:00:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b04d389d53f24dd2fba7468b0d2c69345b0e8798","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

The error was `json.JSONDecodeError`. After my investigation about this error, I found that there are several messages for logging aren't well separated, for example it contains `\\n` inside one single message which should be split into 2 to more different messages.\r\n\r\nWhat my PR do: add try-catch for reading to json, if it encounter `json.JSONDecodeError` again, we should either split by `\\n` and then find `status` to be logged or just print all the payload instead of throw an error just due to an non-critical issue like this.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThe code path is unchanged and already covered by existing unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-18T19:06:42Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T15:26:53Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T15:26:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60196932bb99f17eccfc60a169f9b1d5c6ba2ee6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

is BSD licensed.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] In a few places in the code base we have something that looks like:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   @property\r\n   def x(self):\r\n      if not self._x:\r\n          self._x = self._build_x()\r\n       return self._x\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Instead we should use something like https://pypi.org/project/cached-property/ to make it more declarative for us. And I want to start using this in a few more places.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] No change in behaviour\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the
