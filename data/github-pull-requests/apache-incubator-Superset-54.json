links posted all over the codebase, issues/PRs, and throughout the known universe, are always expiring. They either expire due to TTL, or as soon as 400 people join. \r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the links in the codebase with a bitly link. \r\n\r\nThat bitly link can be updated through a bitly account, which the PMC (and committers?) should have access to. This will be added to the new 1Password account - any PMC members who need access to this, please reach out.\r\n\r\nWhen (not if) the link expires, please update the bitly link accordingly, and all the aliases floating around out there should remain functional. This will be a lot less disruptive and hopefully lead to more people joining!\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWith ssh tunneling being rolled out, we want to start instrument and verify these connections are successful. To do this i've created a new function to append context of the ssh tunneling to the `action` field so ETL can parse this accordingly.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is creating a new column specifically to annotate whether this connection has ssh tunnel enabled. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR makes a few tweaks, with the basic intent of encouraging the community to file Github \"Issue\" discussion threads rather than Github Issues (i.e. bugs) since we already agreed that these would be converted to Discussions anyway. \r\n\r\nIt may may be worth enumerating the nitty gritty here:\r\n* Updates `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the mirrored docs with updated instructions to start a discussion rather than file an issue, a link to do so, and a reminder that Issues will be converted to Discussions (as it already stated in the issue template for Feature reuests\r\n* Various verbiage tweaks to the same files to encourage people to write SIPs if they intend to participate, open PRs if they're able, and a little grammar bycatch\r\n* Fixes the non-functional markdown link in the SIP template\r\n* Adds a default Issue title with `[SIP]` included, and instructions NOT to add the number\r\n* Auto-assigns new SIPs to the committers group (hopefully) for numbering/followup\r\n* Deletes the \"Feature Request\" issue template now that all the rest is said and done.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR enables the new create dataset flow in dataset view, the `+ -> Data` menu in the app header, chart creation, and database creation. On the create dataset page (`/dataset/add/`), user is brought to their previous page when the cancel button is clicked and the create chart view when the create dataset button is clicked.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Check all areas in Superset where user can create a dataset, it should bring you to the new create dataset page: `/dataset/add`\r\n  - All creation spots: `+ Dataset` button in dataset view, the `+ -> Data` menu in the app header, chart creation, and database creation.\r\n  - There should no longer be an Add Dataset modal in any area of the app\r\n- On the new create dataset page, ensure that:\r\n  - Cancel button brings you to the previous page you were on\r\n  - Create Dataset button brings you to the create chart view with the newly created dataset selected\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ]

CI issues in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22413 which I _suspect_ maybe related to the fact that the base datasources/columns/metrics which might not adhere to the SQLAlchemy relationship model, i.e., `BaseDatasource.columns`/`BaseDatasource.metrics` are defined as Python lists as opposed to a `SQLAlchemy.orm.relationship`.\r\n\r\nSomewhat of a Yak Shaving experience, this PR simply deprecates the abstract classes—`BaseDatasource`, `BaseColumn`, and `BaseMetric`—which are no longer needed given that we no longer support the native Druid connector. Note this refactor effort is far from complete—there remains endless spaghetti code which uses a datasource type mapping—but _hopefully_ it's a step (albeit small) in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21874 introduced a CSP check for production environments but ended up making the Talisman configuration dependent on the `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_WARNING` key. This PR fixes this by loading Talisman values independently of the CSP warning.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Play with Talisman configurations\r\n2 - Check that the Talisman configurations are applied independently of the CSP warning\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

In addition, SQL Lab is accessible (albeit doesn't work properly) when the necessary permissions are missing.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n- Removes the \"View in SQL Lab\" option from the Dataset menu\r\n- Redirects the user to the welcome page when trying to access SQL Lab without necessary permissions.\r\n- Remove \"Saved Queries\" from Welcome page if user is missing `sql_lab` role\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow when a user that doesn't have the `sql_lab` role will no longer see the \"View in SQL Lab\" menu item:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/210236216-67179de5-1e3b-45d7-9d07-9a34e512f5b6.png)\r\n\r\nFor admin and users with `sql_lab` role the menu is unchanged:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/210236242-91967cc4-371b-4277-9266-28848034bd8f.png)\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to access SQL Lab without correct perms via a direct URL, the user gets redirected to the welcome page with an error toast. Also, the welcome page doesn't show the \"Saved Queries\" section if the user doesn't belong to the `sql_lab` role (we could optionally check the specific perms for saved queries, but maybe we can do that in a follow up if that's really needed):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/211002955-444661a6-e55f-4c2c-9a93-96bbb0de40ce.png)\r\n\r\nNote that due to the way we're currently caching bootstrap data, toasts don't always appear correctly (they can appear delayed or not get cleared after displaying).

SUMMARY\r\nContinuing the work from #21644, when saving a chart without a time grain, the chart reverts to the default time grain after the chart reloads in Explore view. To get around this, the user must choose the \"Original value\" option from the time grain dropdown. While this works, there should only be one way of clearing the time grain. A summary of changes introduced by this PR:\r\n- When saving the chart with the time grain control in cleared state, the `time_grain_sqla` entry is removed from the form data. To get around this, we check if the chart has been saved by looking at the `metadata` property of the chart state - if it's defined, we know the chart has been saved, in which case we know that the time grain has been explicitly set to `undefined`.\r\n- Remove the \"Original value\" option from the time grain dropdown. After this the time grain should be cleared to be removed. \r\n- Add a \"None\" placeholder when the time grain is cleared. Use the same placeholder for \"Series limit\", as that seems more appropriate for that one, too (currently it shows \"Select ...\")\r\n\r\nThe change has been tested to work in the following scenarios:\r\n- Chart saved with \"Original value\" prior to the change - it renders the chart without the time grain as expected, but with the time grain control in cleared state (as opposed to with \"Original value\")\r\n- Chart saved with time grain\r\n- Chart saved without time grain\r\n- All of the above on a dashboard (verified by looking at the rendered query to confirm that the time grain was applied correctly)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nWith these changes, the time grain remains cleared even after saving:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/210207589-6d6a3fb2-2b3a-4443-aa61-b5e3d99db666.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously, the chart would revert back to the default time grain `P1D` when the chart reloaded in Explore view:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/210207787-51cd2089-213d-4762-baf8-213a3ec425bc.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

This also means that since users create the router - there's no longer any difference in the rendering aspect for memory/browser/hash routers (which only impacts router/history creation) - so we can get rid of those and trim to a simple <code>RouterProvider</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>// Before\nfunction App() {\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n}\n<p>// After\nlet router = createBrowserRouter([{\npath: &quot;/&quot;,\nelement: &lt;Layout /&gt;,\nchildren: [{\nindex: true,\n</code></pre></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a continuation of #21515, which made it possible to exclude specific users from dropdown lists, to make it possible to add arbitrary filter conditions to both the user and role dropdowns. The primary reason for this is to be able to restrict the available roles in the Dashboard role dropdown when using `DASHBOARD_RBAC`, as users may unintentionally give too wide access to dashboards by sharing with a too generic role. Similarly, there may be a need to restrict to whom a user should be able to give ownership of an object.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate, by adding the following to `superset_config.py`, the owners dropdown now only contains the entry `admin`, and the roles dropdown only contains entries starting with the letter \"A\":\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef role_filter(query):\r\n    from superset import security_manager\r\n\r\n    role_model = security_manager.role_model\r\n    filters = [role_model.name.like(\"A%\")]\r\n    return query.filter(or_(*filters))\r\n\r\n\r\ndef user_filter(query):\r\n    from superset import security_manager\r\n\r\n    user_model = security_manager.user_model\r\n    filters = [user_model.username == \"admin\"]\r\n    return query.filter(or_(*filters))\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRA_RELATED_QUERY_FILTERS = {\r\n    \"role\": role_filter,\r\n    \"user\": user_filter,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow users only displays \"Admin\":\r\n\r\n<img width=\"887\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/209462025-fb9c46be-b772-461d-bf8b-473aeeda0760.png\">\r\n\r\nSimilarly roles only contains \"Admin\" and \"Alpha\":\r\n\r\n<img width=\"884\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/209462080-af7f9786-fb74-41e9-8906-052fc8e148e9.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add the above to `superset_config.py`\r\n2.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR finishes up the work from https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21823, replacing all uses of icon components from `@ant-design/icons` with uses of Superset's `Icons` component in an effort to make icon use more consistent.  Superset's `Icons` component applies slightly different styling rules, so this PR includes some styling tweaks to make icons look the same as before, and it fixes some tests that the conversion breaks.  This PR only replaces icons in `superset-frontend/src`: there are a few direct uses of `@ant-design/icons` in `superset-frontend/packages` and `superset-frontend/plugins`, but because `Icons` lives in `src/components`, replacing these would risk circular dependencies.  A follow-up PR could move `Icons` into `@superset-ui/core` and finish the job.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nThis is a hopefully comprehensive before/after comparison of every icon affected.  The only exception is icons in `src/dashboard/nativeFilters/FilterBar/FilterSets` – I couldn't figure out what this code package does or how to find these icons.  I think maybe it's a deprecated feature and the code should be removed?  Not sure though.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n#### `superset-frontend/src/components/Form/LabeledErrorBoundInput`\r\n\r\n`EyeOutlined` before:\r\n![EyeOutlined before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237545-509ddb06-7acf-4b18-9943-6a1317110875.png)\r\n\r\n`EyeOutlined` after:\r\n![EyeOutlined after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237552-c4a23767-52ed-4d99-aa6a-856881157d6f.png)\r\n\r\n`EyeInvisibleOutlined` before:\r\n![EyeInvisibleOutlined before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237560-2555e9b8-c116-4e75-87e6-41c9348c4dfa.png)\r\n\r\n`EyeInvisibleOutlined` after:\r\n![EyeInvisibleOutlined after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237568-f2e67871-1e3b-4a46-ad97-9f839b3e5065.png)\r\n\r\n#### `superset-frontend/src/components/Select/utils`\r\n\r\n`DownOutlined` before:\r\n<img width=\"1165\" alt=\"DownOutlined before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209236869-d8d4c519-521a-4c27-bc95-5fe39d2b5548.png\">\r\n\r\n`DownOutlined` after:\r\n<img width=\"1165\" alt=\"DownOutlined after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209236890-ccecae91-6ddf-4b73-abd0-80f865993d93.png\">\r\n\r\n`SearchOutlined` before:\r\n<img width=\"1165\" alt=\"SearchOutlined before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209236906-01a63265-de44-4501-88fa-91cc23b59235.png\">\r\n\r\n`SearchOutlined` after:\r\n<img width=\"1165\" alt=\"SearchOutlined after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209236934-a729b4f3-a495-47b4-9b14-e032a337a801.png\">\r\n\r\n#### `superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/FiltersBadge/DetailsPanel/index`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209236976-1826acff-8f9d-4c6a-ad2f-f4b39c2ab0b0.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209236992-a4a465dd-154c-46c7-af17-9303ee5cdde1.png)\r\n\r\n#### `superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/FiltersBadge/FilterIndicator/index`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237188-4cdbd886-a9f3-422e-b09d-4b6b9db1b553.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237201-260ec8df-31cf-4446-b1ec-e5b94396b7e0.png)\r\n\r\n#### `superset-frontend/src/explore/components/useExploreAdditionalActionsMenu/index`\r\n\r\nNon-pivot before:\r\n![Non-pivot before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237229-10a85821-7f7c-4b66-b25f-6e0ca24c637c.png)\r\n\r\nNon-pivot after:\r\n![Non-pivot after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237239-5e9e1c09-bedb-4cd1-8392-d43a60c57b74.png)\r\n\r\nPivot before:\r\n![Pivot before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237249-e32a5562-43d2-483f-8b66-8a5aa4b18f1b.png)\r\n\r\nPivot after:\r\n![Pivot after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237269-148560ef-16fb-43d3-8015-ec4d55ec4c9f.png)\r\n\r\n#### `superset-frontend/src/views/CRUD/data/database/DatabaseModal/DatabaseConnectionForm/EncryptedField`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237313-541af679-20e8-4984-83ba-ac563647afa7.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237327-d9404fa8-3bee-4724-9388-e21d8fb20b0b.png)\r\n\r\n#### `superset-frontend/src/views/CRUD/data/database/DatabaseModal/DatabaseConnectionForm/TableCatalog`\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237351-054e2081-cbf4-4bfe-a42d-d7b7458e8044.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/209237361-952e73fc-758c-42b3-8484-0763fd41b92c.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe recent PR #22302 broke a few tests that were assuming certain examples were created by the admin user. For some reason CI didn't catch this, and gave the PR a green checkmark. Since this is an incorrect assumption (they should not be created/owned by anyone), we need to refactor the tests so that they aren't testing incorrect behavior. Alternatively, we may change how examples are created and assigned owners. In addition, the tests should be made less flaky to ensure they fail correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is just a hotfix to unblock master branch, but I will follow up with a proper fix later.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently there is an issue with the plural forms on the frontend. At first, let's take a look at this code: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/7d8fff87b55a2276b7e287772a654c3c63f5b2ce/superset-frontend/src/explore/components/controls/DndColumnSelectControl/DndColumnSelect.tsx#L206-L210 \r\nIt is expected that while extracting these strings into `.po` file using `babel-update.sh` they should look like this:\r\n```\r\nmsgid \"Drop a column here or click\"\r\nmsgid_plural \"Drop columns here or click\"\r\nmsgstr[0] \"\"\r\nmsgstr[1] \"\"\r\n```\r\nor this:\r\n```\r\nmsgid \"Drop a column here or click\"\r\nmsgid_plural \"Drop columns here or click\"\r\nmsgstr[0] \"\"\r\nmsgstr[1] \"\"\r\nmsgstr[2] \"\"\r\n```\r\ndepending on the number of plural forms in the language. For instance, English and French have 2 plural forms and Russian has 3.\r\n\r\nBut in reality none of the `.po` files contain plural forms. For instance, `.po` file for French translations, which has 2 plural forms https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/7d8fff87b55a2276b7e287772a654c3c63f5b2ce/superset/translations/fr/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po#L25 does not contain the desired syntax for translating both of forms: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/7d8fff87b55a2276b7e287772a654c3c63f5b2ce/superset/translations/fr/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po#L4873-L4874\r\n\r\nThe solution to this issue is simple and is offered in this PR. [This is the only official source I have found to prove my changes](https://github.com/python-babel/babel/blob/a45e25e3125f6ee0a9f32387545df318b0b3b2d0/babel/messages/extract.py#L33), but I found same solutions on some russian websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nGo to the root directory of superset and run `./scripts/babel-update.sh`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: closes #21701\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n1. Class attributes of `CeleryConfig` in `docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config.py` are updated due to the [lowercase settings](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#conf-old-settings-map) introduced in version 4.0. \r\n2. Variable `worker_log_level` contained in `config.py` is not mentioned anywhere in the celery documentation, therefore should be removed. It can be replaced with `CELERYD_LOG_LEVEL` or could be removed. To configure logging level option `-l` is used as mentioned [here](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-beat-l). This option is already used in `docker-bootstrap.sh`: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b954f8f56080270fa7f1f68aa962c9e789e96728/docker/docker-bootstrap.sh#L40 hence its usage is excessive in both `config.py` and `superset_config.py` and could be removed.\r\n3. For some reason [optimization option `-O`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-O) was glued to its value `fair` like this: `-Ofair`. Suggested change unglues them in `docker-bootstrap.sh` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently cancelling queries on Trino fails if the query cancellation request is submitted before the query id has been retrieved. This typically happens when executing using async query execution, as the query first gets placed on the Celery queue prior to being executed. To work around this, we add a new method `prepare_cancel_query` on `BaseEngineSpec` which is called when calling the query cancellation endpoint. On Trino this will set an \"early query cancellation\" flag to `True`, which will trigger the query to cancel when `BaseEngineSpec.handle_cursor` is called during query execution. Appropriate tests are also added.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow stopping a query immediately shows the correct alert for both sync and async modes:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/208901143-bf41975a-24d4-476b-8ede-1a2ba3ccb03e.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/208901234-183a11ee-51c8-4730-a2eb-25c845b476d9.mp4\r\n\r\nIn addition, when running queries in sync mode, cancelling a query would sometimes flash the following error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/208893540-a2d5a3c9-6e69-489e-9dd4-069149d6eb38.png)\r\n\r\nThis was due to the result handler not considering the possibility of the query being returned in a stopped state. To fix this, the query result handling logic is changed to only trigger if the result is successful. Some general type cleanup is also done.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Connect to a Trino database\r\n2. Execute a long running query and immediately cancel it\r\n3. Wait for an error to show up complaining about the query failing to stop.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is a follow-up https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21767 and introduces the Default Temporal Column control to non-legacy charts. Previously, the default temporal column used by time-based filters such as Time Range was defined in the Filters control of Explore. When creating a new chart with a dataset containing a temporal column, the application would automatically add that column as a filter in the Filters control and use it as the source for time-based filters. That strategy resulted in some problems with our clients when evaluating the Generic X-axis feature:\r\n- It was not clear that the automatically added filter was used by time-based filters such as Time Range\r\n- Some users deleted the filter without knowing the consequences and then complained that Time Range was not working\r\n- It was not clear that a Time Range filter would be applied to ALL temporal columns present in the Filters control\r\n\r\nAfter internal discussion, we concluded that the best place to make these configurations would be in the native filters module, where a user, when creating a Time Range filter, could potentially select all the temporal columns affected by the filter, even if they come from different datasets. This would give the users the flexibility to create different filter configurations and also clearly show which columns are being affected by the filter. We would like to prototype and validate the solution with our users before changing the native filters module. Meanwhile, we want to provide a solution to the problems stated above, and this PR proposes the following changes:\r\n- Create a new control called Default Temporal Column below the Filters control for non-legacy charts\r\n- This control only appears when `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` is enabled and the dataset has at least one temporal column\r\n- The control should allow the selection of temporal columns or a custom SQL and cannot have its value removed\r\n- When creating a new chart, the control will be automatically filled with the default dataset temporal column\r\n- If the user, drags a temporal column to the X-axis, and it is a different column than the one in the Default Temporal Column, we'll present a modal asking the user if they wish to use the value in the X-axis as the Default Temporal Column\r\n- We're also going to display a tooltip in the control to explain its use with time-based filters\r\n- We'll remove the previous behavior where a filter was automatically added to the Filters control\r\n- If a user defines a temporal filter in Explore (they don't have to), and the column involved in the filter is the same as the one defined in Default Temporal Column then we should replace its value. If the column used in the filter is different than the one in Default Temporal Column, then the filter will not be affected by a Time Range.\r\n- We'll create a migration script to update the Default Temporal Column of charts with the first temporal column in the Filters control or dataset if such a temporal column exists.\r\n\r\nHere's a preview of how the feature will look like:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/208772172-848d7360-caa6-45c1-8a5e-5ad567b8a418.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/208772509-c4be9d92-9f1a-4b68-90d9-0ef299d11a3b.png)\r\n\r\nThe

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR migrates all .less files that target Dashboard, Explore and SqlLab. Generic stylesheets (for example with antd overrides or global LESS variables) are out of scope\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTest all flows related to Dashboard and SqlLab. Compare with current master - there shouldn't be any meaningful changes, except for small spacing changes here and there (so that the spacings use grid unit from Superset's theme).\r\nExplore shouldn't really be affected by this PR - I removed `explore/main.less` stylesheet, but it seems that it wasn't even used at all. However, check the Explore page just to be safe.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nDue to a breaking change in Flask-Login (https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login/pull/378) the code for logging in an `AnonymousUser` breaks for dashboard embedding. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Flask-Login not only renames the method we need, but also makes it quasi-private. We can switch to a different public util function Flask-Login offers since at least version 0.3.0. In all versions I checked it essentially executes the same steps as `reload_user(...)` did (it additionally signals the login event internally, which shouldn't cause issues).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/21987, https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/21146\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nFor any Flask-Login>=0.3.0,<0.7.0:\r\n1. Enable `EMBEDDED_SUPERSET` in `superset/config.py`\r\n2. Run Superset locally\r\n3. Go to any dashboard, get an embed UUID (see https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19364 for detailed instructions)\r\n4. Execute the following\r\n```\r\ncurl \"http://localhost:8088/embedded/<embed_uuid>\"\r\n```\r\n**Expected**: 200 OK with some valid HTML\r\n(Before we would fail with a 500 for any Flask-Login>=0.5.0)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/21987\r\n- [x] Required feature flags: EMBEDDED_SUPERSET\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\ncc @suddjian: Thanks for building this! Tagging you for better visibility and in case I missed anything. Btw, I noticed that `g.user` and the `user` on the `ctx` is actually set to an `AnonymousUser` instance before doing anything in the endpoint; I believe that's some Flask-Login fallback logic. I'm assuming there is some circumstance, some case, where this might not happen and that is why we added the bit of code previously? (That's why I propose to replace it instead of removing it in this PR.)","created_at":"2022-12-20T05:32:19Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T19:52:23Z","closed_at":"2023-01-12T09:48:02Z","merged_at":"2023-01-12T09:48:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5ecfbb90147b7c22c816470e40e7b390f6ce65b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6575674535,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABh_DUpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.1.0","name":"🚢

a timed `.wait` in `nativeFilters.test.ts` to give the filter bar orientation menu time to change orientation after scrolling into position\r\n- Switching the target for `.type` from the `input`'s parent to the `input` itself in horizontal filter bar tests, as the `input`'s parent was at times not considered \"visible\" by Cypress\r\n- Making Cypress wait for the confirmation toast to appear after saving a chart to a dashboard before navigating away from the page\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Check that E2E tests pass on CI, and feel free to re-run a few times to try to catch any extra issues\r\n- Run Cypress E2E tests locally several times with throttling enabled, specifically looking for issues in:\r\n  - `dashboard/drilltodetail.test.ts`\r\n  - `dashboard/nativeFilters.test.ts`\r\n  - `chart_list/list.test.ts`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdd runtime safety checks and improved tests to recursivelyDeleteChildren and findParentId functions\r\n\r\nThere have been cases where a dashboard ends up with an invalid componentId causing code in workspace to fail removal of a tab.  The root cause of where the errant id comes from is still under investigation.  This PR adds runtime safety checks to code that was fail when a bad ID existed to treat the symptom and make the application more fault tolerant.\r\n\r\nPR adds test to simulate bad states passed into functions to ensure they do not throw uncaught errors.\r\nPR also converts two files to TypeScript to make interfaces more clear.\r\n\r\nAll existing tests were left unchanged to ensure previous behavior is stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5614266/208502528-d75d8d48-c4a9-4a89-90dd-174a73e61a84.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Create an interval table with two SQL Expression columns `'1970-02-16 17:45+00'::timestamp` and `'1990-02-16 17:45+00'::timestamp`, name it `start` and `end`.\r\n2. Go to the Birth Names Line chart, and try to add an interval annotation layer from a created table in step 1.\r\n3. You will see an error because renamed columns were parsed incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if
