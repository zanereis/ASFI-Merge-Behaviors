PR modifies Java Schema proto translation code - used for the Java SDK and JVM-based runners - to pass through logical types with unrecognized URNs (e.g. from the Go SDK). It does this by adding a new `UnknownLogicalType` implementation for tracking these types. Any unknown types encountered during schema proto translation are shunted to this implementation.\r\n\r\nThe original motivation for failing on unrecognized logical types was that it's likely that the type establishes some semantic meaning over the base type that the Java SDK/Runner does not understand. So Java should not be allowed to manipulate instances of that type to avoid creating an illegal value.\r\n\r\nHowever, blocking the unrecognized type during proto translation does more than that - it also prevents the Java SDK/Runner from _reading_ instances of the type just to pass them through without manipulation. This is possible in the Java SDK, for example in a projection transform, or a filter transform with a predicate based on some other value in a row. It's also common in runners, which routinely pass through data they know nothing about beyond key and windowing information. This was the cause of BEAM-12417. The Go SDK recently switched to using `beam:coder:row:v1` by default, using many Go-specific logical types that are unknown to Java. When those pipelines were executed on JVM-based runners, which just needed to pass through instances of those types, they failed in this schema proto translation code.\r\n\r\nIf we want to prevent SDKs and runners from manipulating logical types they don't know about it should happen at a different layer, not when translating the protos.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

PR does three things: \r\n1. Changes pubsubio to use the protos in beam_runner_api.proto. This fixes using pubsubio with portable job submission on dataflow, which required the now standard pubsub options.\r\n2. Deletes the go specific code. This fixes the plurality of \"v1.proto\" that the Go SDK had. Now's there's just the Go type serialization handling under that generated file path.\r\n3. We weren't filtering the \"legacy\" External transforms from the xlang handling, leading to a panic. Check first that it has a populated External field before processing.\r\n\r\nTested using the streaming_wordcap example on dataflow, which is a simple example for pubsub reads.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the same spirit as #14850 I added some thorough parameterized tests for global aggregations, separated into their own test suite `AggregationTests`. Not surprisingly this knocked loose a few unhandled edge cases, also fixed in this PR:\r\n- We don't need a specialized implementation of `nunique` in `DataFrame`, it can be done with `_agg_method`. We can add a distributed implementation in `Series` though, based on `drop_duplicates`, and it will be used through `DataFrame.agg`.\r\n- Added logic to direct `DataFrame.agg` to specialized implementations for `corr`, `cov`, `quantile` and `size`.\r\n- Direct `Series.agg` to specialized implementations for `corr`, `cov`.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

@TheNeuralBit @rosetn @melap \r\n\r\nAs of 2.29, the build is still not copying sample.txt into the Maven project. Need to look at that again. In the meantime, I'd like to fix this up so we don't have to use pom.xml for sample text. It's just kind of wrong as is. Here's what I did:\r\n\r\n* Added a brief section explaining how to create a sample.txt file, and then used that file as input in the various runner steps.\r\n* Updated example output to show Shakespeare text instead of pom.xml. It's fake output, but should be okay for now.\r\n* Simplified/prettified some language.\r\n\r\nAll we need to do when the sample.txt is being copied is remove the short section on creating the file.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of TODOs left:\r\n\r\n* Put all of the env-specific and runner-specific steps behind tabs, so they don't all display. This seems to have been broken by the redesign. Right now all of the various runner steps are just displayed down the page. Not pretty.\r\n* Test the inputs and outputs for all of the runners. Direct runner works as expected, but I want to validate all the others. That will take a minute because I haven't used any of them yet...\r\n* See what is broken post-redesign in the Py and Go quickstarts, and fix it.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

@TheNeuralBit \r\n\r\nUpdated query selector to match hrefs in dev and prod. This should work everywhere.\r\n\r\nFrom the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[attr$=value]\r\nRepresents elements with an attribute name of attr whose value is suffixed (followed) by value.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe updated selector should match both of these:\r\n\r\n* `http://localhost:1313/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/flatmap/`\r\n* `/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/flatmap/`\r\n\r\nWorks as expected in dev. To test in staging, prod:\r\n\r\n1. Open a doc page that has a deeply nested link in the nav, e.g. https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/elementwise/flatmap/\r\n2. Navigate to the page in various ways -- refresh page, select page from nav, etc. The left nav should stay open with the page highlighted with styling.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a Nexmark benchmark profile 2% of cpu was spent on\r\nAbstractMapBasedMultimap$WrappedCollection$WrappedIterator\r\nmethods beneath this class.\r\n\r\nThe get method returns a wrapper around the set that allows for set modification.\r\nThis is more expensive to iterate and is also undesired because we don't want\r\nto allow the list to be modified.\r\n\r\nWe iterate over this list many times for counters. It appears that we don't need a wrapped list as it is documented that all consumers should be registered first. So it seems we can just create a copy there to an immutable list and trivially save that cpu.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

commit extends the existing functionality of WithKeys to accept\r\npositional and keyword arguments, consistent with the use of the Map\r\nfunction.  This allows inputs to be passed into the keyword creation\r\nfunction. Example use: utils.WithKeys(key_fn, foo, kwarg1=bar) would\r\npass variables foo and bar into key_fn when each key is created.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR just defines a docstring for every Series and StringMethods operation. Most of these are done by hand via the `with_docs_from` decorator and  a docstring with Beam-specific notes. Others are handled by reworking some infrastructure (`elementwise_method`, `_agg_method`, `_fillna_alias`).\r\n\r\nI've also moved the detail about how to use `read_*` methods out of `read_csv` and into the `io` module-level documentation.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master branch)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <thead>\r\n

a check for trigger safety to Python's GroupByKey. This is similar to `GroupByKey#triggerIsSafe` and `Trigger#mayFinish` from the Java SDK but with some notable changes:\r\n\r\n* Named it `may_lose_data` instead of `may_finish` to better convey the problem and allow more flexibility in the \"true\" scenario.\r\n* Returns an enum rather than a bool to convey the exact reason. This allows us to account for triggers that can lose data for reasons other than finishing (e.g. `Repeatedly(AfterCount(42))` may lose data due to not enough data coming in).\r\n* Determining whether or not the trigger is safe is moved entirely to the specific `TriggerFn` implementation. This minimizes tracking exceptions everywhere anyone may want to forbid unsafe triggers and should make it easier to reuse and expand in the future.\r\n* An `--allow_unsafe_triggers flag` is added to skip the check. Not only does this offer backwards compatibility, but it also allows us avoiding the check when data loss is acceptable or when no unintentional loss is guaranteed (e.g. unit tests). This is similar to the flag for allowing nondeterministic coders.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

I've also added a `check_proxy` to allow us to disable this check for some tests. Addressing these errors will be tracked in BEAM-12379.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master branch)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n

PR includes a few different additions to aggregations: \r\n\r\nAdd support for additional unliftable grouped aggregations\r\n-\r\n`quantile`, `describe`, `corr`, `cov`, `nunique`\r\nNote all of these are similar to std/var/mean: they could be lifted (`quantile` would have to be approximate), but it requires tracking multiple columns for each input. Until we implement the bookkeeping for that we can just support them without lifting.\r\n\r\nAdd support for `describe` in DataFrame and Series\r\n-\r\nThis was missing from my previous aggregation PR.\r\n\r\nAdd generalized support for kwargs that yield a projection in DataFrame.agg\r\n-\r\n`describe` has some different arguments that project columns based on their types (`include`, `exclude`), similar to `numeric_only`. Rather than adding support for all of these explicitly, this PR adds support for doing the projection generally, by eagerly generating the proxy and examining its columns.\r\n\r\nIncrease test coverage of GroupBy in frames_test.py\r\n-\r\nRewrites some of our groupby tests so they are parameterized, and run _every_ aggregation method in a variety of contexts (e.g. after a filter, with a project, etc). All groupby tests are also moved to a new suite, `GroupByTest`, since it's often convenient to run these separately.\r\n\r\nIncreasing this coverage actually exposed a few minor issues with proxy generation, now tracked in jiras and TODOs.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master branch)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <thead>\r\n

It will unblock me to do some more work. Apparently the dev server appends `//localhost:1313` to in-page hrefs, and then the CSS selector we're using to find the active page can't find and style active links in dev. This change adds a second selector to make the thing a little more flexible. There might be a way to prevent the link rewriting through options passed to the dev server, but I don't want to touch **build.gradle** unless I have to.\r\n\r\n* Fixes [BEAM-12372](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-12372).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

are enabled for Flink and Spark through `PortableRunner`, but the corresponding test `test_pack_combiners` was broken and skipped by Flink and Spark. This fixes `test_pack_combiners` for Flink and Spark and removes the test skipping in most cases.\r\n\r\n- Skip `test_pack_combiners` in `FlinkRunnerTestOptimized` because stages produced by translations.pack_combiners are fused by `translations.greedily_fuse`, which prevent the stages from being detecting using counters by the test.\r\n- Remove stage name regular expression assertions that check that there are no unpacked stages after `test_pack_combiners` because these assertions don't work reliably in `FlinkRunnerTest`. The regular expressions can match other stages names such as `InjectDefault` that still contain the unpacked combiner names.\r\n- Change `test_pack_combiners` to assert that combiner packing happens only in batch mode and not in streaming mode.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

default setting appears to be False. This may cause the runner API roundtrips to re-create globally defined types and coders, which leads to subtle type compatibility issues (since this makes checks like type(self)==type(other) to fail).\r\n\r\nbyref is poorly documented in dill (some unaswered questions can be found here: https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/pull/388/files). I empirically found the following instances of code which may break due to this change (when running in remotely distributed fashion):\r\n- Locally defined classes which inherit classes which inherit DoFn (e.g. the module defines class A(beam.DoFn) and the test defines class B(A) in the test body) will not get pickled, which may lead to unpickling error on the worker. This can be easily mitigated by moving the class to global scope. Note, that locally defined classes are properly pickled otherwise.\r\n- Dynamically defined classes manually added to the module dict won't get pickled either. This probably should be with case-by-case refactoring, if happens at all.\r\n\r\nOtherwise there shouldn't be any visible effect on remotely executed pipelines which share the code between workers. InteractiveRunner is affected, but it doesn't support remote execution currently and it should implement more generic way of handling globals rather then relying on sometimes pickling the types.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

two protos the earlier PRs missed, the pubsub payload (imported by dataflow translation), and the session proto.\r\n\r\nThe main issue was likely the v1.proto name that the pubsub payload had adopted, but both needed proper go_package and package specifiers. This PR updates the gen scripts appropriately and the protos themselves.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Updates the \"uniquifiying\" code run against the transforms in a pipeline graph to be idempotent.\r\n  * That is, running the pieplinex.Normalize routine against the same pipeline graph multiple times should yeild the same graph.\r\n  * This affects all portable runners.\r\n* This makes it match against the current dataflow submission preprocessing, incorportating composite scopes names in child names. This matches Python and Java.\r\n* Enable portable job submission against Dataflow.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't enable portable job submission without making the renaming change because otherwise the rendering of Go SDK pipelines in the Dataflow UI is comical. The SDK uses the fully qualified function/type name for DoFn leaf nodes, which for Go are package paths, including \"/\". The dataflow UI uses \"/\" to render it's composites, yeilding a poor user experience with the Go SDK.\r\n\r\nDue to some small reliance on the legacy naming inside Google, a package variable IdempotentNormalize has been added to toggle the behavior. This will be cleaned up in a few months.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
