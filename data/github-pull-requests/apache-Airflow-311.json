is the approach chosen for the HTTP hook and includes a very simple SimpleHttpOperator. This op only checks if the response status code is 20x or a failure. The sensor calls a simple GET and if the response code is 20x, it flows through. (regex is not implemented there, yet, to check on object status). \n\nThe most important bit is the hook, which is a wrapper around HTTP operations and which other, more complex operators can use to interact with other systems over HTTP. \n\nThe example http dag demonstrates how this appears to an end user.\n\nGotcha: for the Simple operator, the code in the dag must ensure that the data is of the right type and the correct content-type header is included, or the request will fail. This is because it's not viable to parse the header and know how to work with the input data to make it sensible.\n\nIf this simple interaction doesn't cut it, a specific operator for that system should be built. The simple op is not intended to be more generic nor clever than this, it probably serves more as an example of how to build your own http operators than useful in many use cases.\n\nObviously, more specific operators would reduce the amount of input parameters in the task instance declaration.\n","created_at":"2015-07-01T02:21:01Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:40:52Z","closed_at":"2015-07-03T00:32:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58af681c251033ebb0a13ec58337be5fe9464e8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/99/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/99/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/99/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/12ab4a4fe49172982a427db30d75bd90d6e7a497","head":{"label":"gtoonstra:http_protocol_sensor","ref":"http_protocol_sensor","sha":"12ab4a4fe49172982a427db30d75bd90d6e7a497","user":{"login":"gtoonstra","id":441978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/441978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra","html_url":"https://github.com/gtoonstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ef2a3eadf6ab86057bc75e3befff2d4e20b8d0da","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache
