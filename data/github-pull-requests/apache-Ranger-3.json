ahead of time memory allocation for family map of type Map<String, Set<String>>. \r\n\r\nImpact: Memory and computational benefit - Huge reduction in memory when large number of columns accessed in multiget and multiput workloads. Memory footprint will get reduced even further when enabling column auth optimization supported by RANGER-4670\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMap<String, Set<String>> getColumnFamilies(Map<byte[], ? extends Collection<?>> families) becomes a bottleneck in multiget and multiput workloads wherein hundred/thousands of columns may be accessed together in a single request as it is a computationally heavy function converting bytes to string and type-casting Collection to set of strings.\r\n\r\nIn the patch, make lazy memory allocation for family map

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRestructure the downloads of service tarballs from `download-archives.sh` to `Dockerfile.ranger-service` as part of the image build for respective services.\r\n\r\n#### Key highlights:\r\n- When building specific images (eg: ranger-hadoop, ranger-hive), only hadoop and hive tarballs are downloaded bringing down the time taken to bring up the containers effectively.\r\n- Allows to take advantage of docker parallelization thereby allowing parallel service tarball downloads. Currently, the service tarball downloads happen in a sequential manner with `download-archives.sh`.\r\n- Although subject to network speeds, this also has shown minor improvements in overall build

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe ranger profile `ranger-jdk11` has been added to build trino with jdk 11 as currently trino plugin is the only plugin to have a compile time dependency on jdk 11. However, it currently builds the full ranger repo. The PR aims to fix this. When modules have a jdk 11 requirement they can be added to this profile.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- Bring up the containers\r\n  - Build with JDK 11: `mvn clean package -DskipTests -P ranger-jdk11`\r\n  - `cp target/ranger-admin.tar.gz dev-support/ranger-docker/dist`\r\n  - `cp target/ranger-trino-plugin.tar.gz dev-support/ranger-docker/dist/`\r\n  - `cd dev-support/ranger-docker`\r\n  - `docker-compose -f docker-compose.ranger.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-postgres.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-trino.yml build`\r\n  - `docker-compose -f

another row batch causes null pointer exception as vectorizedRowBatchMap has old batch references and gets garbage collected.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `log(Writer writer, Collection<AuthzAuditEvent> events)`, creating new row batch causes an exception since the new batch renders references in vectorizedRowBatchMap invalid. \r\nThe creation of new batch is also not necessary as batch of same size was allocated in initORCAuditSchema(). Also, creating a batch larger than orc buffer size is also not useful since the batch is written to writer as soon as its size reaches orc buffer size.\r\n\r\n`   if (batch.size == orcBufferSize) {\r\n                    writer.addRowBatch(batch);\r\n                    batch.reset();\r\n                }`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe unit test case TestAuditQueue.testAuditFileQueueSpoolORC failed when xasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.batch.filequeue.filespool.buffer.size and  xasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.orc.buffersize were unequal. After the fix, the test case passes and now different values (e.g. 10 and 5 respectively as shown below) can be used for these properties. \r\n \r\n```\r\nprops =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Update trino-plugin to be compatible with the latest Trino SPI (version 433)\r\n- I hope it helps someone in trouble with Trino SPI interface changing too fast..\r\n- Related issue: https://github.com/aakashnand/trino-ranger-demo/issues/7\r\n\r\n### WARNING\r\n- latest version of Trino skips all the access control on in-line functions! If you want to manage access on the Trino in-line functions with Ranger, you have to modify codes on the `FunctionResolver`!\r\n  - Related code: https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/core/trino-main/src/main/java/io/trino/metadata/FunctionResolver.java#L312\r\n  - Related issue I raised: https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/19912 \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- I tested this updated plugin with Trino v433(latest) and Ranger v2.4.0\r\n- I guess it will work well with the higher version of Ranger(it may also v3.0.0..?)\r\n\r\n@aakashnand , would you please review this update..?","created_at":"2023-11-24T13:17:42Z","updated_at":"2025-01-19T02:25:11Z","closed_at":"2025-01-19T02:25:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/290/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/290/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/290/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/statuses/1476f834c50daa991e80c81f2144b109fec147ff","head":{"label":"okayhooni:trino/v433_spi","ref":"trino/v433_spi","sha":"1476f834c50daa991e80c81f2144b109fec147ff","user":{"login":"okayhooni","id":81631424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjMxNDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81631424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni","html_url":"https://github.com/okayhooni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":722919522,"node_id":"R_kgDOKxbgYg","name":"ranger","full_name":"okayhooni/ranger","private":false,"owner":{"login":"okayhooni","id":81631424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjMxNDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81631424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni","html_url":"https://github.com/okayhooni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okayhooni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/okayhooni/ranger","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDue to incorrect dependency settings in the distro module, Ranger cannot utilize multicore concurrent compilation. As a result, compiling Ranger is very slow each time, as all modules can only be compiled serially.\r\nWith this patch, Ranger can be compiled in parallel, greatly speeding up the process. Compilation can now be completed in just a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual tests\r\nmvn -T 8 clean  install -DskipTests=true -Dcheckstyle.skip=true

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously added patch for RANGER-4400 used auditEventList in processResults() for the collection of requests and flushed them at a later stage in flushAudit(). This approach results in ConcurrentModificationException because auditEventList can get modified (more events added) while audit events getting flushed. \r\nInstead of collecting these audit events in an array list, this patch flushes the audit event one at a time while they are being processed. This prevents the ConcurrentModificationException as no array list is used.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nsystem tests with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRANGER-2222 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-2222 added support for cluster as new resource. \r\nRangerKafkaAuditHandler overrides the base implementation of RangerDefaultAuditHandler and this implementation overrides the default processResult(RangerAccessResult result) method wherein check is applied to decide if audit is needed or not ( If Cluster Resource Level Topic Creation is not Allowed we don't audit.Subsequent call from Kafka for Topic Creation at Topic resource Level will be audited)\r\nAfter RANGER-3231, the method processResults(Collection<RangerAccessResult> results) is called instead of processResult(RangerAccessResult result). \r\nSince RangerKafkaAuditHandler does not have processResults(Collection<RangerAccessResult> results) i.e. kafka specific way to process results, it falls back on the default RangerDefaultAuditHandler and all authorizations are audited.\r\n\r\nBug fixed / changes proposed: processResults(Collection<RangerAccessResult> results) implemented for RangerKafkaAuditHandler to add checks to determine if auditing is required or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing in dev environment - no cluster deny logs observed after the fix\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-13T16:19:34Z","updated_at":"2023-09-13T18:52:49Z","closed_at":"2023-09-13T16:30:53Z","merged_at":"2023-09-13T16:30:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"da68108bfa3b7a451d6c6964406148f14185f127","assignee":{"login":"fateh288","id":12212643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjEyNjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12212643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288","html_url":"https://github.com/fateh288","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"fateh288","id":12212643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjEyNjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12212643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288","html_url":"https://github.com/fateh288","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/statuses/8c13b3043f56904bf69e2d884728c7113d645310","head":{"label":"fateh288:RANGER-4400","ref":"RANGER-4400","sha":"8c13b3043f56904bf69e2d884728c7113d645310","user":{"login":"fateh288","id":12212643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjEyNjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12212643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288","html_url":"https://github.com/fateh288","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608449987,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEQ1ww","name":"ranger","full_name":"fateh288/ranger","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fateh288","id":12212643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjEyNjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12212643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288","html_url":"https://github.com/fateh288","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fateh288/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fateh288/ranger","description":"Mirror

changes: Test cases for orc audits. Typo fix for zlib compression.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow up patch for RANGER-1837 and RANGER-4178 which enables audit logging in ORC format for HDFS audit destination. \r\n\r\nThe pull request has the following 3 components: \r\n\r\n1) Config consolidation: \r\nCurrently there are 2 configs which will be required to enable orc i.e. `xasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.batch.filequeue.filetype=orc `and config `xasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.filetype=orc`\r\nIdeally, we would want only 1 config to enable orc `xasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.batch.filequeue.filetype=orc`. Also, orc can only be enabled from filequeue, so above config seems more reasonable. \r\n\r\n2) Fixed a typo for zlib compression\r\n\r\n3) Test cases to verify the ORC audit logs functionality and also verify the above config consolidation works as expected. The test cases also serves as configuration list requirement to enable orc audit logs\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests added to test the ORC feature including config consolidation proposed\r\nManual testing on cluster also done to verify the functionality\r\n\r\n## Additional documentation/configuration for reference to enable ORC audit logs (derived from one of the test cases):\r\n```\r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.orc.buffersize=100000000000000, \r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.batch.filequeue.filespool.dir=target/spool,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExceptions while writing ranger audits as JSON to hdfs results in closing the log file, the next successful write to hdfs should use the same

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo start simplifying the work of people who want to build the project using the standard build process, we would like to propose an update of the README.md with the minimum versions necessary for the building of Apache ranger with the plugins and dependencies on them.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, 4 prerequisites are indicated:\r\n- JDK 1.8+ taken from pom.xml \r\n- Apache Maven 3.6.3+ taken from pom.xml\r\n- Hadoop 3.3.0+ taken from tests \r\n- Hive 3.0.0+ taken from tests\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix. Create an issue in ASF JIRA before opening a pull request and\r\nset the title of the pull request which starts with\r\nthe corresponding JIRA issue number. (e.g. RANGER-XXXX: Fix a typo in YYY))\r\n\r\n### Hadoop 3.3.0+\r\n\r\nThe method **CheckPermissionWithContext** was not implemented before hadoop 3.3.0.\r\nHere is the file in which this method is implemented since 3.3.0 and it's possible to see that it wasn't at the release 3.2.4 : https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/release-3.2.4-RC0/hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/server/namenode/INodeAttributeProvider.java\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to build the latest version, if we try to build with the hadoop.version flag pointing to 3.2.4 version we get the following error: \r\n\r\n> [ERROR] /usr/hdp/ranger/hdfs-agent/src/main/java/org/apache/ranger/authorization/hadoop/RangerHdfsAuthorizer.java:[229,2] error: method does not override or implement a method from a supertype\r\n\r\n\r\n### Hive 3.0.0+\r\nAt the beginning, we wanted to build Apache Ranger with hive.version=2.3.3. \r\n\r\n>[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project ranger-hive-plugin: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.apache.ranger:ranger-hive-plugin:jar:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT: Failed to collect dependencies at org.apache.hive:hive-service:jar:2.3.3 -> org.apache.hive:hive-exec:jar:2.3.3 -> org.apache.calcite:calcite-core:jar:1.10.0 -> org.pentaho:pentaho-aggdesigner-algorithm:jar:5.1.5-jhyde\r\n\r\nThe approach we have tried to fix this was to add the following to both ```ranger-hive-plugin-shim/pom.xml``` and ```hive-agent/pom.xml``` for both hive-exec and hive-service artifacts inside <exclusions></exclusions>:\r\n ```\r\n                     <exclusion>\r\n                        <groupId>org.pentaho</groupId>\r\n                        <artifactId>*</artifactId>\r\n                    </exclusion>\r\n```\r\nWe got the following error (for example with hive.version=2.8.1):\r\n>[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project ranger-hive-plugin: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.apache.ranger:ranger-hive-plugin:jar:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT: The following artifacts could not be resolved: org.apache.hive:hive-common:jar:2.8.1 (absent), org.apache.hive:hive-service:jar:2.8.1 (absent), org.apache.hive:hive-exec:jar:2.8.1 (absent), org.apache.hive:hive-metastore:jar:2.8.1 (absent), org.apache.hive:hive-jdbc:jar:2.8.1 (absent): org.apache.hive:hive-common:jar:2.8.1 was not found in https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots during a previous attempt. This failure was cached in the local repository and resolution is not reattempted until the update interval of apache.snapshots.https has elapsed or updates are forced \r\n\r\nWe had the same errors for all versions < 3.0.0\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested on CentOS 7.9 with JDK-8 and JDK-11, Apache Maven 3.9.3 \r\n\r\nTested by

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>SciPy 1.10.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>SciPy <code>1.10.0</code> is the culmination of <code>6</code> months of hard work. It contains\nmany new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and better\ndocumentation. There have been a number of deprecations and API changes\nin this release, which are documented below. All users are encouraged to\nupgrade to this release, as there are a large number of bug-fixes and\noptimizations. Before upgrading, we recommend that users check that\ntheir own code does not use deprecated SciPy functionality (to do so,\nrun your code with <code>python -Wd</code> and check for <code>DeprecationWarning</code> s).\nOur development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on the\n1.10.x branch, and on adding new features on the main branch.</p>\n<p>This release requires Python <code>3.8+</code> and NumPy <code>1.19.5</code> or greater.</p>\n<p>For running on PyPy, PyPy3 <code>6.0+</code> is required.</p>\n<h1>Highlights of this release</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new dedicated datasets submodule (<code>scipy.datasets</code>) has been added, and is\nnow preferred over usage of <code>scipy.misc</code> for dataset retrieval.</li>\n<li>A new <code>scipy.interpolate.make_smoothing_spline</code> function was added. This\nfunction constructs a smoothing cubic spline from noisy data, using the\ngeneralized cross-validation (GCV) criterion to find the tradeoff between\nsmoothness and proximity to data points.</li>\n<li><code>scipy.stats</code> has three new distributions, two new hypothesis tests, three\nnew sample statistics, a class for greater control over calculations\ninvolving covariance matrices, and many other enhancements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New features</h1>\n<h1><code>scipy.datasets</code> introduction</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new dedicated <code>datasets</code> submodule has been added. The submodules\nis meant for datasets that are relevant to other SciPy submodules ands\ncontent (tutorials, examples, tests), as well as contain a curated\nset of datasets that are of wider interest. As of this release, all\nthe datasets from <code>scipy.misc</code> have been added to <code>scipy.datasets</code>\n(and deprecated in <code>scipy.misc</code>).</li>\n<li>The submodule is based on <a href=\"https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/\">Pooch</a>\n(a new optional dependency for SciPy), a Python package to simplify fetching\ndata files. This move will, in a subsequent release, facilitate SciPy\nto trim down the sdist/wheel sizes, by decoupling the data files and\nmoving them out of the SciPy repository, hosting them externally and</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[RANGER-3254](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-3254) implemented a change in user/group mapping so that sync source is taken into account when a group name matches multiple sources. LDAP users belonging to a group like \"CN=mygroup\" will not be synced in Ranger if there is an existing \"mygroup\" that was imported by UnixUserGroupBuilder.\r\n\r\nThis breaks a very common use case where posix users and groups are synced to the OS from an LDAP backend. In those cases, both the linux OS and LDAP/AD are using the same identity repository. If Ranger imported a set of users and groups from one sync source, and then later switches to another, group mappings break and users don't get all of their groups.\r\n\r\nProvide an option to treat users/groups from multiple sync sources as same for updating group memberships.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested changes by changing sync source & restarting usersync.\r\n\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAddition of 2 new REST APIs to delete external users and groups.\r\nThe proposed approach uses existing methods for deletion of users & groups via 2 REST API calls(1 for users and 1 for groups), all the processing of deletes happen in Java with immediate transaction commit for every user/group.\r\n\r\n\r\nStats(time taken):\r\n- Users:\r\n  - Deletion of **50k** users takes: **33 mins 28 seconds** @ **40 ms** per delete operation (This is still expensive, more on this later)\r\n- Groups:\r\n  - Deletion of **100k** groups takes: **2 mins 51 seconds** @ **1.7 ms** per delete operation.\r\n\r\nCurrent benchmark: **5.3** seconds for every delete operation. ([info](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-3794))\r\nImprovement(via this PR): **133X** (for ex: to delete 50k users via current python scripts it would take 3 days and 2 hrs approx.)\r\n\r\nTo further improve the running time of user deletes, db schema changes would be required as one possible approach.\r\nOn average per delete operation 35 ms/40 ms (~ 88%) of the time goes in updating 64 tables which have FK constraints on _**x_portal_user**_ (more info [here](https://github.com/apache/ranger/blob/aea071ca7c029e45e08beb7392d50c582f0e0c68/security-admin/src/main/java/org/apache/ranger/service/XPortalUserService.java#L195))\r\n\r\nTo avoid this \"ON DELETE CASCADE/NULL\" needs to be enabled for the respective db tables, which may improve the performance of the API significantly. This will be taken up in another jira to target best achievable running time for large no. of users/groups deletion.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested using docker.\r\n\r\nTested the latest patch with the following REST API calls:\r\n* service/xusers/delete/external/groups?name=group_usertest_3982_b\r\n* service/xusers/delete/external/groups?isVisible=0\r\n*

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`@JsonProperty` annotation has been added to model classes for mapping the properties with their corresponding getter/setter methods. This will not effect Ranger's functionality directly, but it will provide consistency in case there is Jackson jar conflict (or when/if Jackson is upgraded to version-2).\r\nPlease see the Jira for more detailed analysis of the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-4225 \r\n\r\nBasically, some of the model classes do not comply with JavaBean naming conventions, therefore it is possible that Ranger may hit this issue https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30205006/why-does-jackson-2-not-recognize-the-first-capital-letter-if-the-leading-camel-c \r\n\r\nAs a reference of the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanges were made to fix functionality to store audit logs in orc format that was proposed in RANGER-1837 (https://reviews.apache.org/r/63552/diff/7/)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was tested for the hdfs plugin. \r\n\r\nFollowing steps were carried out:\r\n1. In Namenode host, created spool directory and changed owner so that it can be read/write/execute for owner of the Service\r\nmkdir -p  /var/log/hdfs/audit/staging/spool\r\ncd /var/log/hdfs/audit/staging\r\nchown hdfs:hadoop spool\r\n\r\nEnabled AuditFileQueue via following params in ranger-hdfs-audit.xml\r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.batch.queuetype=filequeue\r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.batch.filequeue.filespool.file.rollover.sec=300\r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.batch.filequeue.filespool.dir=/var/log/hdfs/audit/staging/spool\r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.batch.filequeue.filespool.buffer.size=10000\r\n\r\n2.Enable ORC file format for Ranger HDFS Audit in ranger-hdfs-audit.xml. \r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.filetype=orc\r\n\r\n3. Provision to control the compression techniques for ORC format in ranger-hdfs-audit.xml.\r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.orc.compression=snappy\r\n\r\n4. Buffer Size and Stripe Size of ORC file batch. Default is '10000' bytes and '100000' bytes respectively.\r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.orc.buffersize=10000\r\nxasecure.audit.destination.hdfs.orc.stripesize=100000\r\n\r\n5. Add ORC jars to plugin path: \r\nPlugins have orc-core, orc-shims and aircompressor dependencies missing. Manually added simlinks to the plugin classpath\r\nWork in progress to add these dependencies to the distro instead of manually adding it to ranger-hdfs-plugin-impl:\r\n\r\ncd path/hadoop/lib/ranger-hdfs-plugin-impl\r\nln -s jar_location/jars/orc-core-1.7.6.jar .\r\nln -s jar_location/jars/orc-shims-1.7.6.jar .\r\nln -s jar_location/jars/aircompressor-0.10.jar .\r\n\r\n6. Restarted using hdfs stale config\r\n\r\n7. Verify by creating hive table from orc data… \r\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ranger_audit_event_new(\r\nrepoType int,\r\nrepo string,\r\nreqUser string,\r\nevtTime string,\r\naccess string,\r\nresource

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIssue:\r\n1. Resource-based policy for ozone key are working fine\r\n2. Ozone bucket and volume based tag policies are working as expected\r\n3. Tag policies are downloaded but the deny permissions for ozone key classification don't work\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nLogic for parsing ozone qualified name changed such that '/' is not included in the key name which was causing issue previously.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAfter changes, ozone key based policies are properly enforced and deny permissions work as
