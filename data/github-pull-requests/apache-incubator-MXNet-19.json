Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the backward mirroring implementation. Specifically, it takes into account for each (group of) operator node whether doing backward mirroring can be truly benefitial to the total memory footprint (please refer to test case #1 and #2 below). It also considers the data dependencies between the forward node and its corresponding gradient node. This is because it is possible for the feature maps of a layer to be recomputed without recomputing the layer itself (e.g., the Fully-Connected layer, test case #3). Those improvements allow us to further optimize the memory consumption of our DNN training models.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Backward Mirroring Improvements\r\n- Test Case #1: RNN Cell\r\n  - In the following graphs, we will be using red arrows to denote backward dependencies (a.k.a. feature maps), which usually are the main contributor of the memory consumption.\r\n  - In the example below that mimics an RNN cell, we shall NOT be doing backward mirroring, because otherwise the total amount of feature maps storage will be doubled.\r\n\r\n<img height=\"200pt\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19616653/80934632-23e4d980-8d97-11ea-8d01-b7d31d1c2e92.png\"/> <img height=\"200pt\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19616653/80934684-4545c580-8d97-11ea-93de-4634738914d4.png\"/>\r\n\r\n- Test Case #2: MLP Attention\r\n  - In the example below that mimics the MLP attention (a.k.a. additive attention), we shall be doing backward mirroring, because it can help reduce the total maount of feature maps storage from O(T^2 N) to O(2T N).\r\n\r\n<img height=\"200pt\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19616653/80936274-6e1d8900-8d9e-11ea-88fc-3f91b6e86b21.png\" /> <img height=\"200pt\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19616653/80936292-842b4980-8d9e-11ea-8509-a2883bb8b51e.png\" />\r\n\r\n- Test Case #3: Fully-Connected Layer\r\n  - In the example below that uses a red node to denote a compute-heavy layer whose gradients are not dependent on the output data entries (e.g., the Fully-Connected layer). The red node can also be put on the mirror path. This enables us to relieve the backward dependency on its feature maps (i.e., inputs) without incurring significant performance overhead.\r\n\r\n<img height=\"100pt\"

Description ##\r\nNightly PyPI packages are currently not getting published to https://dist.mxnet.io/python/all\r\n\r\nThere is an error in pipeline Build stage for GPU variants [link](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-release-job/detail/mxnet-cd-release-job/1053/pipeline/77). The logs state the following error - `ERROR: No artifacts found for this configuration.`\r\n\r\nThe binaries for all variants are present in s3, but GPU builds couldn't find them as they are searching at the wrong path. This issue arises because the s3 bucket path contains OS version, which is different during upload and download of GPU binaries. This PR fixes this issue by hard-coding OS to be the same for both upload and download.\r\n\r\nThis also resolves a similar error in Python docker images pipeline [link](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-release-job/detail/mxnet-cd-release-job/1054/pipeline/124)\r\n\r\nThere is another error in both pipelines: [link1](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-release-job/detail/mxnet-cd-release-job/1053/pipeline/308) [link2](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/restricted-mxnet-cd%2Fmxnet-cd-release-job/detail/mxnet-cd-release-job/1054/pipeline/62), which is due to a `SyntaxError` caused by incorrect bash script trigger command. This PR also resolves these

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes nightly CD GPU tests by updating the build toolchain to use cmake static build and updating dnnl headers stash location. It removes 7.5 arch for cu100, cu101, cu102 builds to solve oversized libmxnet.so binary issue with cmake builds.\r\nIt also fixes the issue with dnnl headers packaging into nightly build artifacts. Fixes #18120 \r\n\r\nHere's the link to a broken CD pipeline:

Description ##\r\nFix for LSTM and GRU layers without DNNL enabled give wrong gradients #17898\r\n\r\nFor bidiractional LSTM with number of layers > 2 input gradient calculation was incorrect.\r\nReason of wrong calculations was overwriting y derivative (dy) tensor by\r\ncalculated x derivative (dx) tensor before right2left layer could use dy for own\r\ngradient calculations.\r\n\r\nFor GRU with number of layers > 2 i2h_weight gradient for\r\nlayers in the middle (all except last and first) was incorrect.\r\nWrong caluculations were caused by assigning output pointer to\r\ninput instead of calculating new input pointer.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete

Description ##\r\nThis is the 2nd part of the QR backward implementation. The 1st part (merged) covered square and deep matrix shapes (nrows >= ncols) and part 2 now covers the remaining wide matrix shapes (ncols > nrows).\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[Differential Programming Tensor Networks](https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.031041)\r\n\r\nThe added test includes a numerical check (via central differences) of the analytical gradient  since this is a novel implementation.

Description ##\r\nAccording to this issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16059, the version selection dropdown widget is not clean. And the dropdown event is triggered by hovering, which can be not only triggered unintentionally and the long list can cover the following buttons giving a bad user experience.\r\nRedesigned the dropdown widget (please see changes for details). To test, simply navigate to `get started` page and toggle the `MXNet verision` button. \r\n\r\n> Please let me know or leave a message if you don't like it or have any suggestion. Thanks.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Show dropdown when top button got clicked, attach a down arrow to indicate button is clickable\r\n- [x] Clicking on top button toggles the display of dropdown content. Click outside dropdown content when it is showing will hide the content\r\n- [x] Reduce the length and increase the width of the dropdown contents, and make the contents scrollable\r\n- [x] Add hover highlight to dropdown buttons\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Preview:  http://ec2-54-191-240-239.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/","created_at":"2020-04-29T00:27:36Z","updated_at":"2020-05-04T21:47:21Z","closed_at":"2020-05-04T21:44:40Z","merged_at":"2020-05-04T21:44:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"aeef33aff1637c8798b19e14f9181e41c2fe835c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nCurrently, Unix GPU & Centos GPU tests use P3 & G3 AWS EC2 instances.\r\nIn an effort to improve the cost & efficiency, switch to G4 EC2 instances has been proposed.\r\n\r\nThis switch involves upgrading the GPU toolchain broadly\r\n| Host Machine | Old | New |\r\n|-------------------|---------|-----------|\r\n| Ubuntu LTS | 16.04.3 | 18.04.3 |\r\n| Tesla Driver |   M60 | T4 |\r\n| EC2 Instance Type | G3 | G4 |\r\n| Docker | 18.09 | 19.03 |\r\n| NVidia Driver | 418.56 | 440.33.01 |\r\n| Cuda Driver | 10.1 | 10.2 |\r\n\r\n### Code Changes ###\r\n1. Latest Docker [19.03] has built-in cuda support [hence replace nvidia-docker with docker --gpus all]\r\n2. Given that the host machine has updated drivers, TVM Op shouldn't need cuda compat [`/usr/local/cuda/compat`]\r\n3. replacing `ubuntu_gpu_cu101` with `ubuntu_build_cuda`\r\nDocker compose follows multi-stage build [https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/] and defines multiple targets\r\n`ubuntu_build_cuda` target is `gpuwithcudaruntimelibs`\r\n`ubuntu_gpu_cu101`  target is : gpuwithcompatenv [which has been commented out now]\r\n\r\n4. ~~After testing this on CI Dev account : http://jenkins.mxnet-ci-dev.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/mxnet-validation-bapac%2Funix-gpu/detail/update_gpu_toolchain/8/pipeline~~\r\n~~The TVMOpError related to Binary Ops was encountered : https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17840~~\r\n~~To unblock the migration from G3 to G4, these flaky tests have been skipped.~~\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThanks to @ptrendx for the help identifying libcuda compat as the rootcause for \r\n```\r\nCUDA: Check failed: e == cudaSuccess (803 vs. 0) : system has unsupported display driver / cuda driver combination\r\n```\r\nHelped me close : https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/issues/1256\r\n\r\nThanks to @leezu and @josephevans throughout this migration effort and @sandeep-krishnamurthy @szha for the guidance.","created_at":"2020-04-28T16:04:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T08:41:45Z","closed_at":"2020-05-12T02:25:03Z","merged_at":"2020-05-12T02:25:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"21899f87f552b4d78a48ae0947047dce37ce13e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/2b05566c12956d82f48a03b9cabb24667d962a64","head":{"label":"ChaiBapchya:update_unix_gpu_toolchain","ref":"update_unix_gpu_toolchain","sha":"2b05566c12956d82f48a03b9cabb24667d962a64","user":{"login":"ChaiBapchya","id":10992635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTkyNjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10992635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya","html_url":"https://github.com/ChaiBapchya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147581538,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc1ODE1Mzg=","name":"mxnet","full_name":"ChaiBapchya/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ChaiBapchya","id":10992635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTkyNjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10992635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya","html_url":"https://github.com/ChaiBapchya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChaiBapchya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ChaiBapchya/mxnet","descript

Description ##\r\nimproving GPU kernel performance with cached stride calculations and shape data to improve performance. \r\n- passing mshadow::Shape slowed the kernel speed by approx 15% so passed it separately in a struct. \r\n- unroll gives boost of about 4%\r\n- major chunk of improvement by caching stride calculations and combining 2 redundant multiplications\r\n\r\nThis change is done in order to maintain BERT performance when large tensor is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nCPU performance remains identical or better than master-lt and master respectively(no changes there)\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\n\r\nDigamma fwd bwd implemented, tested.\r\nNow uses could implement the entropy (as well as KL divergence) of Gamma/Beta/Dirichlet distribution differentiablely.\r\n\r\ntrigamma code largely borrowed from https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/1a0b95e7e46a056546a49f7f8b40aaf6ffa11dde/aten/src/ATen/native/Math.h#L149\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-23T14:43:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T20:29:41Z","closed_at":"2020-04-24T20:29:41Z","merged_at":"2020-04-24T20:29:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c1e67f3738976c9562c4fccfca1f2b60f59baf8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18148/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18148/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18148/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/72b29903f703b636386e0378dab54c104d238dea","head":{"label":"xidulu:digamma_dev","ref":"digamma_dev","sha":"72b29903f703b636386e0378dab54c104d238dea","user":{"login":"xidulu","id":26022201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIyMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26022201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu","html_url":"https://github.com/xidulu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195962165,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU5NjIxNjU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"xidulu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xidulu","id":26022201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIyMjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26022201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu","html_url":"https://github.com/xidulu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xidulu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xidulu/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nBackport #17177 to the branch for v1.7.x.\r\n\r\nCurrently, many operators utilize `std::stod` to convert strings into floating point numbers. This causes incorrect calculations (#17140, #16134) when the C locale is set to a locale which uses commas (`,`) as decimal separators.\r\n\r\nThis pull request replaces calls to `std::stod` and `std::stof` to the locale-invariant `dmlc::stod` and `dmlc::stof` respectively.\r\n\r\n### The scope of this patch ###\r\n\r\nThis patch should fix a large portion of interactions through Python and JVM frontends, since they use locale-invariant serialization in order to pass parameters into MXNet's C API.\r\n\r\nHowever, frontends which utilize C locale-aware serialization (i.e. call `sprintf` or similar) may break when using locales which don't use `.` as the decimal separator. They will have to be fixed in a separate patch. I also suspect that they are already broken, because operators utilising dmlc-core parameter parsing were already using locale-invariant serialization.\r\n\r\n### Further steps ###\r\nSTL streams are heavily used within the codebase, both for serialization and for forming user-friendly messages. Fortunately, they don't seem to be affected by the C standard library locale settings. However, if someone sets the STL locale by calling [std::locale::global](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/locale/global), MXNet's API will be broken. In order to ensure that this doesn't happen, all streams which are used for serialization will have to be imbued with the \"C\" locale (not the locale set in the C standard library).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see a more principled approach to serialization in MXNet 2.0, e.g. using a binary format for communication between the frontend and the backend. In addition to solving locale-related issues, this would probably result in a smaller invocation overhead.\r\n\r\n### Locale-invariant serialization vs locale-aware serialization ###\r\n\r\nAs a side-note, using locale-aware serialization is not an option, simply because using `,` as the decimal separator adds ambiguities to tuple serialization, e.g. `(4,4,3)` can be a tuple of 3 integers, or a tuple of 2 floats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Replace `std::stod` with `dmlc::stod` and `std::stof with `dmlc::stof`.\r\n- [x] Add a test that tests locale invariance for scalar ops.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- May break Julia and R code when using a locale that uses `,` as the decimal separator. However, since there was no consistency between the various operators before, it is not unlikely that the code was already broken.

Description ##\r\nForce the docker to use cache for intermediate layers.\r\ncache_intermediate flag prevents removal of intermediate layers while building docker containers in the slave instances.\r\n\r\nHowever, by setting it to False by default, this caching of intermediate layers is never used in our CI docker containers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis should hopefully cache the intermediate steps for subsequent CI runs on an instance that has already build the docker container.

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nThis PR shows how to get rid of duplicate Dockerfiles and the `install/X.sh` code deduplication strategy on the example of CentOS7 Dockerfiles. Instead, we use a single templated Dockerfile with a multiple targets for different scenarios. The template arguments and respective targets are declared in `docker-compose.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis has multiple benefits:\r\n\r\n1) Having a single Dockerfile instead of a number of scripts is easier to understand and maintain\r\n2) Copying scripts into the Dockerfile as done in the previous approach prevents usage of the https://hub.docker.com/u/mxnetci/ cache on developer machines, as the `COPY` instruction invalidates the cache if the local repository does not match the repository used on CI (eg. development branch instead of master branch). If the cache is invalidated, developers must wait for long docker build time when attempting to reproduce certain CI builds (such as website build, cc @aaronmarkham) or using the docker image to perform the staticbuild.\r\n3) Having fewer steps in the Dockerfile improves the build speed.","created_at":"2020-04-20T20:09:34Z","updated_at":"2020-04-22T00:35:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-22T00:34:57Z","merged_at":"2020-04-22T00:34:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"b85e4468f47cc8bc687e62f30a06b2e6757ecdb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR includes broadcast_add into fused operators\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR): \r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Created a new list of fused compatible ops for broadcast ops. For now only added broadcast_add\r\n- [x] Generation of code for  broadcast ops was included and functions were modified to allow different number of dimensions in the input tensors.\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nThis pull request changes all tests to load the user's locale and changes the CentOS CI jobs to run with `LC_NUMERIC` set to `en_DK.UTF8`. `en_DK.UTF8` is a locale that uses `,` as the decimal separator. This should weed out any bugs similar to #16134, #17140 and #18079. A partial fix for v1.x is available in #17177. Migrating operators and other API calls to the new FFI in MXNet 2.0 should resolve most locale-related issues related to API calls.\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes many tests fail because they only pass on systems with `LC_NUMERIC` set to a locale that uses `.` as the decimal separator.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Tests updated to call `locale.setlocale` on initialization.\r\n- [x] CentOS jobs updated to run with `LC_NUMERIC` set to `en_DK.UTF8`.\r\n- [x] xfail/cancel tests which fail due to the incorrect handling of decimal separators.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-18T13:38:39Z","updated_at":"2020-05-10T01:49:39Z","closed_at":"2020-05-10T01:49:39Z","merged_at":"2020-05-10T01:49:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"eab068bdfc1837f8610ffdd33205399913763892","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18097/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18097/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18097/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1c42d798ce02c66999f2983e8af015cb849729ef","head":{"label":"nickguletskii:feature/ci-centos-locale-change","ref":"feature/ci-centos-locale-change","sha":"1c42d798ce02c66999f2983e8af015cb849729ef","user":{"login":"nickguletskii","id":786473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NjQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/786473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii","html_url":"https://github.com/nickguletskii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickguletskii/f

Description ##\r\nCurrently, significantly more time can be spent initializing cufft plans than actually executing them, as new plans are created at each Forward and Backward pass. This PR changes it so that plans are created only once for Forward/Backward passes for a given shape. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Initialize cufft plans only once in

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] In pointwise fusion pass, set as fusion-compatible both LeakyReLU and _backward_LeakyReLU if activation type is in the provided list (only \"gelu\" for now)\r\n- [x] In the fused-ops code generator, include functions for LeakyReLU:gelu and _backward_LeakyReLU:gelu (they are equivalent to mshadow_op.h version)\r\n- [x] Included test into tests/python/gpu/test_fusion.py\r\n\r\n##

picked from commit afae030beb168f09cf08be101714e059157a9507)\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nFixed issue where fp32 inputs use tensor cores for the interleaved multihead attention operators, resulting in lower precision calculations and potential reduction in accuracy.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Set interleaved multihead attention GEMM default to not use tensor cores, and only use if input data type is fp16\r\n- [x] No longer checks for tensor input shape divisibility by 8\r\n\r\n## Comments

##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-16T09:56:47Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T16:28:39Z","closed_at":"2020-05-14T02:14:35Z","merged_at":"2020-05-14T02:14:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"effbb8b7498e58259bafa6010b8d042bff8d239c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ef3058adba8353fd8fa81b39264b543d64e0dac7","head":{"label":"acphile:master","ref":"master","sha":"ef3058adba8353fd8fa81b39264b543d64e0dac7","user":{"login":"acphile","id":24974319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTc0MzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24974319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile","html_url":"https://github.com/acphile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":255489819,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTU0ODk4MTk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"acphile/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"acphile","id":24974319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTc0MzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24974319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acphile","html_url":"https://gith

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] In pointwise fusion pass, set as fusion-compatible both LeakyReLU and _backward_LeakyReLU if activation type is in the provided list (only \"gelu\" for now)\r\n- [x] In the fused-ops code generator, include functions for LeakyReLU:gelu and _backward_LeakyReLU:gelu (they are equivalent to mshadow_op.h version)\r\n- [x] Included test into tests/python/gpu/test_fusion.py\r\n\r\n##

[MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc
