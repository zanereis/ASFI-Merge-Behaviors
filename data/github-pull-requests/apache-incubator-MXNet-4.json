Layout Management improves performance when used together with AMP by converting parts of the computational graph to NHWC layouts. \r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nTarget graph parts (containing convolution / deconvolution ops) are automatically converted to NHWC layout by surrounding with transposes.\r\nThis functionality was originally implemented by Dawid Tracz <dtracz@nvidia.com> in the Nvidia container. I later changed the algorithm to a single pass of DFSVisit.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] A new layout_optimization flag is added to amp.init() call\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis other PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/20635 is required in order to get the expected performance

Description ##\r\nWe notice that only nnvm operators support `FInplaceIdentity` property but legacy operators do not, which leads to `InplaceOption` failing when the storage reference count is large

Description ##\r\nThere is used Prospector ' tool to perform additional formatting and semantic checking of code. Prospector is a tool to analyse Python code and output information about errors, potential problems, convention violations and complexity. (Related to: #20406, #20356)\r\n\r\nSince Prospector needs to be installed with an appropriate configuration, the file with the requirements has to be run:\r\n```Script\r\npip install prospector\r\n```\r\nTo run a Prospector , open your terminal and type:\r\n```Shell\r\npython3 -m prospector --profile prospector.yaml\r\n```\r\nFuture improvements: \r\n- Check only changed

During investigation of the problem it turned out that it regards only cases with amount of input channels lower than 4 and switching away from primitive with weight dnnl::format_tag ABcd4b16a4b fixes the issue.

Description ##\r\nFunction concatenate() from module mxnet.numpy will now be executed by oneDNN primitives as it is done in module mxnet.ndarray. Additionally concat from mxnet.ndarray will gain numpy fuctionality which is flattening input arrays when parameter dim=None.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Merge NNVM_REGISTER_OP(_npi_concatenate) with NNVM_REGISTER_OP(concatenate)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nIt was possible to merge both ndarray and numpy concatenate operators into one NNVM_REGISTER_OP, additional functionality was added to ndarray concatenate by this process.\r\nPerformance tests from mxnet profiler with 10 warmup runs and 50 test runs of this operator are given

Description ##\r\nThis change ports Convolution and Deconvolution operations to cuDNN v8 API.\r\nLegacy API support is dropped, as per this RFC: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20618.\r\n\r\nThe change also includes some cuDNN v8 API general support stuff, to be re-used later when more operations are ported to the v8 API.\r\n\r\nFinally, auto-tuning functionality is moved from cuDNN into MXNet, hence some memory management changes were required.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [X] Code is

Description ##\r\nThis PR makes cuDNN-backed BatchNorm operator use newer API calls (cudnnBatchNormalizationForwardTrainingEx / cudnnBatchNormalizationBackwardEx), which bring in significant speed up in some cases (fp16 NHWC / NDHWC layouts).\r\n\r\nI also refactored and simplified code a bit.\r\n\r\nI tested fp16 NHWC speedup on my Layout Management feature branch (not up-streamed yet) on ResNet50 model.\r\nThe correctness should be covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Make use of newer cuDNN API calls / new kernels\r\n- [x] Refactoring\r\n\r\n@DickJC123

PR is an answer to the statement from oneDNN:\r\n\"oneDNN decided to stop shipping and supporting mkldnn compatibility layer (old names of mkldnn instead of dnnl). The change that removes it is targeting v2.5.\r\n \r\nCompatibility layer was introduced in v1.1 when library changed the name. At that time we posted an article how to smoothly transfer from mkldnn to dnnl in source codes and other places. Here's the article: https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/v2/dev_guide_transition_to_dnnl.html\r\n \r\nWho's impacted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\nUsers who update oneDNN binaries without re-compilation of oneDNN won't see any effect from MKLDNN_somevar env variables.\r\n\t\r\nUsers who compile oneDNN from scratch are impacted more:\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\nIf user's build system utilizes oneDNN build switches starting with MKLDNN_ prefix, option won't affect the build, and likely CMake would spit a warning message saying such variables weren't used.\r\n\t\t\r\nIf source codes are still utilizing mkldnn namespace or types/APIs that contain mkldnn_ prefix, they won't be compiled successfully.\r\n\t\t\r\nIf end application is linked against libmkldnn.so, it won't be linked successfully.\r\n\t\t\r\nFinally, MKLDNN_somevar env variables won't take affect in run-time.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWe are kindly asking to make sure that mkldnn prefix is not used anywhere on your side, neither in product nor in testing environment.\r\n\r\nv2.5 Branch cutoff October 29, 2021 (ww44.5), production release December 10, 2021.  Feel free to ask questions. Thank you.\".\r\n\r\nThis change also aims to unify names used to refer to dnnl library in mxnet.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-24T11:12:42Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T08:09:39Z","closed_at":"2021-10-13T20:48:10Z","merged_at":"2021-10-13T20:48:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e04608ea5fc88ef54d0e3b4e1e0a170335e1671","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"M

Description ##\r\nThis pull request includes the greatest common divisor implementation (std::gcd) of the integers m and n and computes the least common multiple (std::lcm) of the integers m and n. If MxNet's project is built with c++17, then <numeric> support is enabled. Following implementation works fine for a given test cases: `__gcd(5, 0) == 5 && __gcd(0, 5) == 5 && __gcd(0, 0) == 0`;\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] PR's title starts with a
