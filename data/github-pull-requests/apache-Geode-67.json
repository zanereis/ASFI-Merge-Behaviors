EvictionController classes are no longer Serializable nor Cloneable. These internal classes used to be external and needed to be these things in the past because they were stored in the configuration. But they no longer are so these interfaces were removed for clarity.\r\nThe EvictionController classes are no longer responsible for creating InternalEvictionStatistics. Instead the other entities it depends on are passed in to its constructor.\r\n\r\nThe only class with an EvictionController instance is now VMLRURegionMap which makes the code easier to understand and reduces the number of inter-module dependencies.\r\n\r\nrenamed internalSetMaximum to setMaximum on EvictionAttributesImpl\r\n\r\nAbstractBucketRegionQueue no longer uses EvictionStatistics to notify itself that it removed some objects from the queue. So it no longer needs to access all the EvictionStatistics.\r\n\r\nAbstractLRURegionMap has been moved to VMLRURegionMap\r\nCasts to AbstractLRURegionMap have been removed by added additional methods to RegionMap.\r\n\r\nnew EvictableRegion interface make clear the things a region implementation needs to do/provide for the eviction implementation\r\n\r\nEvictionAttributesMutator is now implemented by the dedicated class EvictionAttributesMutatorImpl\r\n\r\nclose and clear on RegionMap now take a BucketRegion parameter so that the eviction classes do not need to keep track of the BucketRegion.\r\n\r\nEvictionList no longer does some of the things it did before that should have been the responsibility of the EvictionController. Now the EvictionList is given the EvictionController it should defer to. The EvictionListBuilder has been simplified since EvictionList now only needs a controller.\r\n\r\nThe eviction classes that track statistics have been refactored to be clearer. Now the EvictionStats interface is implemented by classes that provide vsd type stats. The EvictionCounters interface is implemented by a class that wraps EvictionStats and provides atomics for some of

fix for GEODE-870 added a new boolean instance variable to\r\nGMSJoinLeave to tell its ViewCreator thread to shut down.  This works\r\nbut the state was never being reset after its first use.  This caused\r\nSubsequent ViewCreator threads to shut down immediately.  The only\r\nway to fix this condition without a patch is to restart the coordinator node.\r\n\r\nThe patch moves this boolean variable to the ViewCreator thread so that\r\nit is automatically reset when a new ViewCreator is instantiated.\r\n\r\nI also did a little code cleanup, moving GMSJoinLeave methods from the\r\nend of the file to where its other methods are located and adding\r\na setShutdownFlag() method during debugging so I could isolate what\r\nwas happening.\r\n\r\n@galen-pivotal @upthewaterspout @PivotalSarge @kohlmu-pivotal \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Also cleaned up the more egregious code-cleanliness offenses.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLocators before 1.4.0 (currently SNAPSHOT) are asynchronous in configuration.  This presents a possible race condition in our tests that bring up servers without waiting for the locator to be fully configured.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that every test touched in this PR should be entirely rewritten using the `ClusterStartupRule`.  Notably, `ClusterStartupRule.startLocator` already enforces this wait period.\r\n\r\n(GEODE-4255 is in development and will allow easier control of member/client VMs in `ClusterStartupRule`.

DistributionManagerDUnitTest -> ClusterDistributionManagerDUnitTest\r\n* ConsoleDistributionManagerDUnitTest -> ClusterDistributionManagerForAdminDUnitTest\r\n\r\nI tried to get the test for exceptionInThreads working but it looks like any exceptions are caught deeper and never end up visible to the DistributionManager, so I deleted that test. The related methods in DistributionManager should be deleted or wired up properly by whoever ends up refactoring the contents of ClusterDistributionManager.

*PR* applies [Traute](http://traute.oss.harmonysoft.tech/) *javac* plugin to the project. It enhances compilation process in a way to insert *null*-checks into resulting bytecode based on source code annotations.  \r\n\r\nLet's check [LocalProcessLauncher](https://github.com/apache/geode/blob/develop/geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/internal/process/LocalProcessLauncher.java#L66):  \r\n\r\n*Source code before*  \r\n\r\n```java\r\nLocalProcessLauncher(final File pidFile, final boolean force)\r\n    throws FileAlreadyExistsException, IOException, PidUnavailableException {\r\n  notNull(pidFile, \"Invalid pidFile '\" + pidFile + \"' specified\");\r\n    \r\n  this.pid = identifyPid();\r\n  this.pidFile = pidFile;\r\n  writePid(force);\r\n}\r\n```  \r\n\r\n*Source code after*  \r\n\r\n```java\r\nLocalProcessLauncher(@NonNull final File pidFile, final boolean force)\r\n    throws FileAlreadyExistsException, IOException, PidUnavailableException {\r\n  this.pid = identifyPid();\r\n  this.pidFile = pidFile;\r\n  writePid(force);\r\n}\r\n```  \r\n\r\nResulting bytecode looks like if it's compiled from the source below:  \r\n\r\n```java\r\nLocalProcessLauncher(@NonNull final File pidFile, final boolean force)\r\n    throws FileAlreadyExistsException, IOException, PidUnavailableException {\r\n  if (pidFile == null) {\r\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid pidFile 'null' specified\");\r\n  }\r\n  this.pid = identifyPid();\r\n  this.pidFile = pidFile;\r\n  writePid(force);\r\n}\r\n```  \r\n\r\n*Bytecode*  \r\n\r\n```\r\njavap -c ./geode-core/build/classes/main/org/apache/geode/internal/process/LocalProcessLauncher.class\r\n...\r\n  org.apache.geode.internal.process.LocalProcessLauncher(java.io.File, boolean) throws org.apache.geode.internal.process.FileAlreadyExistsException, java.io.IOException, org.apache.geode.internal.process.PidUnavailableException;\r\n    Code:\r\n       0: aload_0\r\n       1: invokespecial #2                  // Method java/lang/Object.\"<init>\":()V\r\n       4: aload_1\r\n       5: ifnonnull     18\r\n       8: new           #3                  // class java/lang/IllegalArgumentException\r\n      11: dup\r\n      12: ldc           #4                  // String Invalid pidFile 'null' specified\r\n      14: invokespecial #5                  // Method java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.\"<init>\":(Ljava/lang/String;)V\r\n      17: athrow\r\n       ...\r\n```  \r\n\r\nBenefits:  \r\n* less boilerplate\r\n* the code is better documented\r\n* it's easier to add new checks (just annotate target method parameters/return values by the *NonNull* or, alternatively, [specify non-null by default](http://traute.oss.harmonysoft.tech/core/javac/#72-notnullbydefault-annotations))","created_at":"2018-01-03T09:13:15Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T18:58:41Z","closed_at":"2018-05-14T18:58:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90d458ceb42b5cade5fc303b3ef1b3924054c42d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/1216/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/1216/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1216/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/d4994ceeebdffe868b33f2d6b4871f3e507e3b8e","head":{"label":"denis-zhdanov:traute-null-checks","ref":"traute-null-checks","sha":"d4994ceeebdffe868b33f2d6b4871f3e507e3b8e","user":{"login":"denis-zhdanov","id":290609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDYwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/290609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov","html_url":"https://github.com/denis-zhdanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/denis-zhdanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"0f8cd8e1ef12ab864f5b2ae7a0556156b249b432","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34839383,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDgzOTM4Mw==","name":"geode","full_name":"apache/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/geode","description":"Apache

GEODE-4116 Can't get PDX objects using the new protocol\r\n\r\nAdded a distributed test to ensure end-to-end handling of JSON documents\r\nis functioning correctly.
