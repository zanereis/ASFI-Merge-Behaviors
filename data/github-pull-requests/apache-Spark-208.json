for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd an overload for the `slice` function that can accept Columns for the `start` and `length` parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis will allow users to take slices of arrays based on the length of the arrays, or via data in other columns.\r\n```scala\r\ndf.select(slice(x, 4, size(x) - 4))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, before the `slice` method would only accept Ints for the start and length parameters, now we can pass in Columns and/or Ints.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds initial plan in `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` and generates tree string for both current plan and initial plan. When the adaptive plan is not final, `Current Plan` will be used to indicate current physical plan, and `Final Plan` will be used when the adaptive plan is final. The difference between `Current Plan` and `Final Plan` here is that current plan indicates an intermediate state. The plan is subject to further transformations, while final plan represents an end state, which means the plan will no longer be changed. \r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nBefore this change:\r\n```\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=true\r\n+- *(3) BroadcastHashJoin\r\n   :- BroadcastQueryStage 2\r\n       ...\r\n```\r\n`EXPLAIN FORMATTED`\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (9)\r\n+- BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (8)\r\n   :- Project (3)\r\n   :  +- Filter (2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this change\r\n```\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=true\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   *(3) BroadcastHashJoin\r\n   :- BroadcastQueryStage 2\r\n   :  +- BroadcastExchange\r\n           ...\r\n+- == Initial Plan ==\r\n   SortMergeJoin\r\n   :- Sort\r\n   :  +- Exchange\r\n           ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`EXPLAIN FORMATTED` \r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (9)\r\n+- == Current Plan ==\r\n   BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (8)\r\n   :- Project (3)\r\n   :  +- Filter (2)\r\n+- == Initial Plan ==\r\n   BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (8)\r\n   :- Project (3)\r\n   :  +- Filter (2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt provides better visibility into the plan change introduced by AQE. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It changed the AQE plan output string.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is related to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656 only support use FILTER clause on aggregate expression without DISTINCT.\r\nThis PR will enhance this feature when one or more DISTINCT aggregate expressions which allows the use of the FILTER clause.\r\nSuch as:\r\n```\r\nselect sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;\r\nselect class_id, sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\nselect count(id) filter (where class_id =

This is good because we can evaluate filter in first aggregate locally.\r\nBut `AggregationIterator` only support single DISTINCT aggregate with filter clause.\r\nSo, this PR uses `Project` to project the filter clause as new generated attribute(e.g. _gen_attr_0) and ensure the evaluation at local.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark SQL only support use FILTER clause on aggregate

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for plugins to be able to provide columnar exchanges when AQE is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n\r\n- In AdaptiveSparkPlanExec, the newQueryStage method now optimizes the Exchange node rather than just optimizing its children. This allows plugins to participate in optimizing and replacing the Exchange node itself.\r\n- New abstract base classes have been introduced for ShuffleExchange and BroadcastExchange so that Spark can work with replaced versions of these operators.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe changes are needed so that plugins can provide columnar exchage operators when AQE is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests have been updated as part of this PR to test replacing broadcast and shuffle exchanges when AQE is enabled.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-16T15:03:36Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T14:20:22Z","closed_at":"2020-07-28T14:19:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3cd6849a62aac1f1de8e761625a2e5f62d654f19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2fd2c089c91df76d9ab2958e788853e954c9eb8d","head":{"label":"andygrove:support-columnar-exchanges","ref":"support-columnar-exchanges","sha":"2fd2c089c91df76d9ab2958e788853e954c9eb8d","user":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205463461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU0NjM0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"andygrove/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake the test result log of github action more readable by showing errors from SBT only.\r\n1. Add \"--error\" flag to sbt in github action to set the log level as \"ERROR\"\r\n2. Show only failed test cases in stderr output of github action. According to https://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_the_runner, with SBT option `-eNCXEHLOPQMDF ` we can drop all the following events:\r\n```\r\nN - drop TestStarting events\r\nC - drop TestSucceeded events\r\nX - drop TestIgnored events\r\nE - drop TestPending events\r\nH - drop SuiteStarting events\r\nL - drop SuiteCompleted events\r\nO - drop InfoProvided events\r\nP - drop ScopeOpened events\r\nQ - drop ScopeClosed events\r\nR - drop ScopePending events\r\nM - drop MarkupProvided events\r\n```\r\nand enable the following two mode:\r\n```\r\nD - show all durations\r\nF - show full stack traces\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the output of github action is very long and we have to scroll down to find the failed test cases. Even more, the log may be truncated. In such a case, we will have to wait until all the jobs are completed and then download all the raw logs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nBefore changes, all the warnings in compiling are shown:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/87846810-98ec8900-c887-11ea-913b-164b84df62cd.png)\r\n\r\nas well as all the passed and ignored test

job:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/87846961-e74e5780-c888-11ea-82d5-cf1da1740181.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/87745273-5735e280-c7a2-11ea-8ac9-b4b0e3cb458d.png)\r\n\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the rule `PruneFileSourcePartitions` removes the advanced statistics (cardinality, column stats) of the underlying `LogicalRelation` and keeps only `sizeInBytes` as that is the only value we can be sure that is accurate when a partition pruning happens.\r\nThis PR changes that and keeps all statistics as they are a good upper limit estimates and by keeping them other rules that depend on the presence of these statistics (like `CostBasedJoinReorder`) can run.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPerformance improvement.\r\n\r\nI measured nice improvement using a bit amended (spark.sql.cbo.enabled=true, spark.sql.cbo.joinReorder.enabled=true, analized source tables) TPCDSQueryBenchmark on scaleFactor=5 data with TPCDS queries:\r\nQ10: 18%, Q17: 10%, Q18: 19%, Q25: 29%, Q29: 49%, Q30: 35%, Q37: 22%, Q50: 59%, Q65: 19%, Q69: 34%, Q73: 45%, Q76: 21%, Q81: 29%, Q82: 51%, Q91: 12%\r\n\r\nOnly 2 of the queries suffered performance degradation:\r\nQ16: -19%, Q49: -18%\r\n\r\nPlease note that the % here are showing the difference due to this PR as the baseline was set with (spark.sql.cbo.enabled=true, spark.sql.cbo.joinReorder.enabled=true, analized source tables).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs and benchmarks.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-16T13:23:43Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T09:30:08Z","closed_at":"2021-01-18T09:13:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29c354e6fe5f21607b4dee4d4e7f334db774c46e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29132/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29132/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29132/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1dfe9f0aae1e799b77c2e264a20e5a0539a5d90c","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-32331-keep-advanced-stats","ref":"SPARK-32331-keep-advanced-stats","sha":"1dfe9f0aae1e799b77c2e264a20e5a0539a5d90c","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n[KAFKA-7703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7703) has been discovered and a workaround has been added in SPARK-26267. At that time Spark was using 2.0.0 `kafka-clients` library and the issue was resolved in 2.3.0. Now Spark uses 2.5.0 `kafka-clients` library which allows us to remove the workaround. SPARK-26267 has added multiple things to address this issue:\r\n* Called `position` right after `poll` function which blocks until `poll` result is available\r\n* Introduced a safety logic to make sure positions seen in previous batch are smaller or equals to the newly acquired offsets from Kafka. If this assumption not applies retry happens.\r\n\r\nTo be on the safe side and detect bugs similar to [KAFKA-7703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7703) only the first change is removed in this PR. This means if any similar issue may appear retry still happens to correct latest offsets.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n[KAFKA-7703](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7703) resolved and no workaround needed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Existing unit tests.\r\n* Crafted a special test with sleeps [here](https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/kafka/commit/466cbbf9cc09c39390409b7675bc1e48bc265e5c).\r\nThis is the 2.5.0 adaptation of @zsxwing reproduction code created [here](https://github.com/zsxwing/kafka/commit/4e1aa11bfa99a38ac1e2cb0872c055db56b33246).\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-16T13:18:37Z","updated_at":"2020-07-17T07:22:13Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T07:22:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea046b95f894a76dd24af4ead454454950224cde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently `ShuffledHashJoin.outputPartitioning` inherits from `HashJoin.outputPartitioning`, which only preserves stream side partitioning (`HashJoin.scala`):\r\n\r\n```\r\noverride def outputPartitioning: Partitioning = streamedPlan.outputPartitioning\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis loses build side partitioning information, and causes extra shuffle if there's another join / group-by after this join.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwithSQLConf(\r\n    SQLConf.AUTO_BROADCASTJOIN_THRESHOLD.key -> \"50\",\r\n    SQLConf.SHUFFLE_PARTITIONS.key -> \"2\",\r\n    SQLConf.PREFER_SORTMERGEJOIN.key -> \"false\") {\r\n  val df1 = spark.range(10).select($\"id\".as(\"k1\"))\r\n  val df2 = spark.range(30).select($\"id\".as(\"k2\"))\r\n  Seq(\"inner\", \"cross\").foreach(joinType => {\r\n    val plan = df1.join(df2, $\"k1\" === $\"k2\", joinType).groupBy($\"k1\").count()\r\n      .queryExecution.executedPlan\r\n    assert(plan.collect { case _: ShuffledHashJoinExec => true }.size === 1)\r\n    // No extra shuffle before aggregate\r\n    assert(plan.collect { case _: ShuffleExchangeExec => true }.size === 2)\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent physical plan (having an extra shuffle on `k1` before aggregate)\r\n\r\n``` \r\n*(4) HashAggregate(keys=[k1#220L], functions=[count(1)], output=[k1#220L, count#235L])\r\n+- Exchange hashpartitioning(k1#220L, 2), true, [id=#117]\r\n   +- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[k1#220L], functions=[partial_count(1)], output=[k1#220L, count#239L])\r\n      +- *(3) Project [k1#220L]\r\n         +- ShuffledHashJoin [k1#220L], [k2#224L], Inner, BuildLeft\r\n            :- Exchange hashpartitioning(k1#220L, 2), true, [id=#109]\r\n            :  +- *(1) Project [id#218L AS k1#220L]\r\n            :     +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n            +- Exchange hashpartitioning(k2#224L, 2), true, [id=#111]\r\n               +- *(2) Project [id#222L AS k2#224L]\r\n                  +- *(2) Range (0, 30, step=1, splits=2)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIdeal physical plan (no shuffle on `k1` before aggregate)\r\n\r\n```\r\n*(3) HashAggregate(keys=[k1#220L], functions=[count(1)], output=[k1#220L, count#235L])\r\n+- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[k1#220L], functions=[partial_count(1)], output=[k1#220L, count#239L])\r\n   +- *(3) Project [k1#220L]\r\n      +- ShuffledHashJoin [k1#220L], [k2#224L], Inner, BuildLeft\r\n         :- Exchange hashpartitioning(k1#220L, 2), true, [id=#107]\r\n         :  +- *(1) Project [id#218L AS k1#220L]\r\n         :     +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n         +- Exchange hashpartitioning(k2#224L, 2), true, [id=#109]\r\n            +- *(2) Project [id#222L AS k2#224L]\r\n               +- *(2) Range (0, 30, step=1, splits=2)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by overriding `outputPartitioning` method in `ShuffledHashJoinExec`, similar to `SortMergeJoinExec`.\r\nIn addition, also fix one typo in `HashJoin`, as that code path is shared between broadcast hash join and shuffled hash join.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid shuffle (for queries having multiple joins or group-by), for saving CPU and IO.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the build issue on Hive 1.2 profile brought by #29069, via putting mocks for HiveSessionImplSuite in hive version related subdirectories, so that maven build will pick up the proper source code according to the profile.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#29069 fixed the flakiness of HiveSessionImplSuite, but given the patch relied on the default profile (Hive 2.3) it broke the build with Hive 1.2 profile. This patch addresses both Hive versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually confirmed the test suite via below command:\r\n\r\n> Hive 1.2\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn -Dtest=none

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR(SPARK-31168) upgrade Scala from **2.12.10** to **2.12.12**.\r\n\r\nScala 2.12.11 release notes:\r\n**Highlights**\r\n- Performance improvements in the collections library\r\n- Performance improvements in the compiler\r\n- Improvements to `-Yrepl-class-based`, an alternative internal REPL encoding that avoids deadlocks\r\n- A new `-Yrepl-use-magic-imports` flag that avoids deep class nesting in the REPL, which can lead to deteriorating performance in long sessions\r\n- Fix some toX methods that could expose the underlying mutability of a ListBuffer-generated collection\r\n\r\n**JDK 9+ support**\r\n- ASM was upgraded to 7.3.1, allowing the optimizer to run on JDK 13+\r\n- `:javap` in the REPL now works on JDK 9+\r\n\r\n\r\nScala 2.12.12 release notes:\r\n**Highlights**\r\nThis release adds compiler support for scala-async and backports substantial performance improvements to collections.\r\n\r\n- The compiler now includes a phase that performs the transformation for the async/await DSL for working with Scala Futures.\r\n This transform is based on the macro implementation in `scala-async` but has been substantially rewritten to fix some\r\n long standing bugs, reduce the overhead of compilation and simplify the extension points for third party effect systems.\r\n `scala-async` 1.0.0 will be released shortly building atop this phase.\r\n- `immutable.{TreeSet, TreeMap}` are now based on a backport of the 2.13.x implementation.\r\n- The builders for `immutable.{HashMap, HashSet}` are more efficient -- they now use mutation during building to reduce memory churn.\r\n\r\n**Further highlights**\r\n- Minor improvements to compiler performance. The allocation rate of the compiler is reduced by 10%.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprovement performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExist test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-15T10:27:28Z","updated_at":"2020-07-26T15:08:30Z","closed_at":"2020-07-26T12:08:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e52ca64cb029020573620f0f5fab1bf6816f408b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29124/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29124/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29124/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3adc82a2c4f9dc4f4ae418efba885ad713d8ee26","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-31168","ref":"SPARK-31168","sha":"3adc82a2c4f9dc4f4ae418efba885ad713d8ee26","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e4499932da03743cb05c6bcc5d0149728380383a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`spark.kryo.registrator` in 3.0 has a regression problem. From [SPARK-12080](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12080), it supports multiple user registrators by\r\n```scala\r\nprivate val userRegistrators = conf.get(\"spark.kryo.registrator\", \"\")\r\n    .split(',').map(_.trim)\r\n    .filter(!_.isEmpty)\r\n```\r\nBut it donsn't work in 3.0. Fix it by `toSequence` in `Kryo.scala`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn previous Spark version (2.x), it supported multiple user registrators by\r\n```scala\r\nprivate val userRegistrators = conf.get(\"spark.kryo.registrator\", \"\")\r\n    .split(',').map(_.trim)\r\n    .filter(!_.isEmpty)\r\n```\r\nBut it doesn't work in 3.0.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n\r\n- Don't use `--user` in pip packaging test\r\n- Pull `source` out of the subshell, and place it first.\r\n- Exclude user sitepackages in Python path during pip installation test\r\n\r\nto address the flakiness of the pip packaging test in Jenkins.\r\n\r\n(I think) #29116 caused this flakiness given my observation in the Jenkins log. I had to work around by specifying `--user` but it turned out that it does not properly work in old Conda on Jenkins for some reasons. Therefore, reverting this change back.\r\n\r\n(I think) the installation at user site-packages affects other environments created by Conda in the old Conda version that Jenkins has. Seems it fails to isolate the environments for some reasons. So, it excludes user sitepackages in the Python path during the test.\r\n\r\nIn addition, #29116 also added some fallback logics of `conda (de)activate` and `source (de)activate` because Conda prefers to use `conda (de)activate` now per the official documentation and `source (de)activate` doesn't work for some reasons in certain environments (see also https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7980). The problem was that `source` loads things to the current shell so does not affect the current shell. Therefore, this PR pulls `source` out of the subshell.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I made the analysis purely based on Jenkins machine's log in this PR. It may have a different reason I missed during my observation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the build and tests pass in Jenkins.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests should test it out.","created_at":"2020-07-15T04:43:08Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:43:08Z","closed_at":"2020-07-21T13:49:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a44f74d71596b5d3864070cfceacdeaccaa7946","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29117/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29117/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29117/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/30eb41d5b3b665d1c48b7e05918de54a73227ec3","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:debug-conda","ref":"debug-conda","sha":"30eb41d5b3b665d1c48b7e05918de54a73227ec3","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to test PySpark with Python 3.8 in Github Actions. In the script side, it is already ready:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4ad9bfd53b84a6d2497668c73af6899bae14c187/python/run-tests.py#L161\r\n\r\nThis PR includes small related fixes together:\r\n\r\n1. Install Python 3.8\r\n2. Only install one Python implementation instead of installing many for SQL and Yarn test cases because they need one Python executable in their test cases that is higher than Python 2.\r\n3. Do not install Python 2 which is not needed anymore after we dropped Python 2 at SPARK-32138\r\n4. Remove a comment about installing PyPy3 on Jenkins - SPARK-32278. It is already installed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, only PyPy3 and Python 3.6 are being tested with PySpark in Github Actions. We should test the latest version of Python as well because some optimizations can be only enabled with Python 3.8+.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade PySpark's embedded cloudpickle to the latest cloudpickle v1.5.0 (See https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/blob/v1.5.0/cloudpickle/cloudpickle.py)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are many bug fixes. For example, the bug described in the JIRA:\r\n\r\ndill unpickling fails because they define `types.ClassType`, which is undefined in dill. This results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/apache_beam/internal/pickler.py\", line 279, in loads\r\n    return dill.loads(s)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dill/_dill.py\", line 317, in loads\r\n    return load(file, ignore)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dill/_dill.py\", line 305, in load\r\n    obj = pik.load()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dill/_dill.py\", line 577, in _load_type\r\n    return _reverse_typemap[name]\r\nKeyError: 'ClassType'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/82. This was fixed for cloudpickle 1.3.0+ (https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/337), but PySpark's cloudpickle.py doesn't have this change yet.\r\n\r\nMore notably, now it supports C pickle implementation with Python 3.8 which hugely improve performance. This is already adopted in another project such as Ray.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, as described above, the bug fixes. Internally, users also could leverage the fast cloudpickle backed by C pickle.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins will test it out.","created_at":"2020-07-15T01:16:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:43:10Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T02:49:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"081a6937791d4d75cb98ff3dddb130a3d04492e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/74ba6759e1aef58034130787765eac0e04bc36bb","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32094","ref":"SPARK-32094","sha":"74ba6759e1aef58034130787765eac0e04bc36bb","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the by-name resolution logic of `unionByName` is put in API code. This patch moves the logic to analysis phase.\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28996#discussion_r453460284.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLogically we should do resolution in analysis phase. This refactoring cleans up API method and makes consistent resolution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

Note, during encoder resolving, types like `map`, `array` will be resolved to new expression(e.g. `MapObjects`, `CatalystToExternalMap`).\r\n\r\nHowever, `ExpressionEncoder` can't be canonicalized. Thus, the canonicalized `ScalaUDF`s become different even if their original  `ScalaUDF`s are the same. Finally, it fails the `checkValidAggregateExpression` when this `ScalaUDF` is used as a group expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users will not hit the exception after this fix. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdapting the code to Scala 2.13\r\n\r\nI didn't find a specific JIRA ticket for it, so I used the umbrella ticket as a reference.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI'm working on adapting REPL to Scala 2.13.x. \r\n\r\nI opened a [PR for it](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28545), but it was some time ago and the code changed since, with many conflicts in respect to the master branch.\r\n\r\nSo I think it's better to open first a number of smaller PRs that compile both in Scala 2.12 and 2.13. Once the modules that REPL depends on compile, I'll open a new PR that fixed the REPL itself.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport SBT_MAVEN_PROFILES=scala-2.13\r\n./build/sbt core/compile core/test:compile\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach module has its own commit.\r\n\r\nIt was compiled Scala 2.12 as well, without the SBT_MAVEN_PROFILES variable set.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-14T16:28:23Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T20:16:34Z","closed_at":"2020-07-14T18:37:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3b80b8f4ef7b98e43b62e83f55fc3ef1224adb7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNormally, a Null aware anti join will be planed into BroadcastNestedLoopJoin which is very time consuming, for instance, in TPCH Query 16.\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect\r\n    p_brand,\r\n    p_type,\r\n    p_size,\r\n    count(distinct ps_suppkey) as supplier_cnt\r\nfrom\r\n    partsupp,\r\n    part\r\nwhere\r\n    p_partkey = ps_partkey\r\n    and p_brand <> 'Brand#45'\r\n    and p_type not like 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'\r\n    and p_size in (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)\r\n    and ps_suppkey not in (\r\n        select\r\n            s_suppkey\r\n        from\r\n            supplier\r\n        where\r\n            s_comment like '%Customer%Complaints%'\r\n    )\r\ngroup by\r\n    p_brand,\r\n    p_type,\r\n    p_size\r\norder by\r\n    supplier_cnt desc,\r\n    p_brand,\r\n    p_type,\r\n    p_size\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn above query, will planed into\r\n\r\nLeftAnti\r\n    condition Or((ps_suppkey=s_suppkey), IsNull(ps_suppkey=s_suppkey))\r\n\r\nInside BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec will perform O(M\\*N), BUT if there is only single column in NAAJ, we can always change buildSide into a HashSet, and streamedSide just need to lookup in the HashSet, then the calculation will be optimized into O(M).\r\n\r\nBut this optimize is only targeting on null aware anti join with single column case, because multi-column support is much more complicated, we might be able to support multi-column in future.\r\nAfter apply this patch, the TPCH Query 16 performance decrease from 41mins to 30s\r\n\r\nThe semantic of null-aware anti join is:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17242071/88077041-66a39a00-cbad-11ea-8fb6-c235c4d219b4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTPCH is a common benchmark for distributed compute engine, all other 21 Query works fine on Spark, except for Query 16, apply this patch will make Spark more competitive among all these popular engine. BTW, this patch has restricted rules and only apply on NAAJ Single Column case, which is safe enough.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. SQLQueryTestSuite with NOT IN keyword SQL, add CONFIG_DIM with spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin on and off\r\n2. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.JoinSuite.\r\n3. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.SubquerySuite.\r\n3. Compare performance before and after applying this patch against TPCH Query 16.\r\n4. config combination against e2e test with following\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap(\r\n  \"spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"false\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"false\"\r\n),\r\nMap(\r\n  \"sspark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd additional configuration to `maven-clean-plugin` to ensure cleanup `metastore_db` and `spark-warehouse` directory when execute `mvn clean` command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow Spark support two version of build-in hive and there are some test generated meta data not in target dir like `metastore_db`,  they don't clean up automatically when we run `mvn clean` command. \r\n\r\nSo if we run `mvn clean test -pl sql/hive -am -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive -Phive-1.2 ` , the `metastore_db` dir will created and meta data will remains after test complete.\r\n\r\nThen we need manual cleanup `metastore_db` directory to ensure `mvn clean test -pl sql/hive -am -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive` command use hive2.3 profile can succeed because the residual metastore data is not compatible.\r\n\r\n`spark-warehouse` will also cause test failure in some data residual scenarios because test case thinks that meta data should not exist.\r\n\r\nThis pr is used to simplify manual cleanup `metastore_db` and `spark-warehouse` directory operation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual execute `mvn clean test -pl sql/hive -am -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive -Phive-1.2`, then execute `mvn clean test -pl sql/hive -am -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive`, both commands should succeed.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-14T12:15:28Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T03:43:49Z","closed_at":"2020-07-14T19:40:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b533f30ba2e5ca519059ad70c0e3247f1cc5f578","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf4d2c60708f47f139b573bd0253d027ad045155","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:add-clean-directory","ref":"add-clean-directory","sha":"cf4d2c60708f47f139b573bd0253d027ad045155","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28733 and #28805, CNF conversion is used to push down disjunctive predicates through join and partitions pruning.\r\n\r\nIt's a good improvement, however, converting all the predicates in CNF can lead to a very long result, even with grouping functions over expressions.  For example, for the following predicate\r\n```\r\n(p0 = '1' AND p1 = '1') OR (p0 = '2' AND p1 = '2') OR (p0 = '3' AND p1 = '3') OR (p0 = '4' AND p1 = '4') OR (p0 = '5' AND p1 = '5') OR (p0 = '6' AND p1 = '6') OR (p0 = '7' AND p1 = '7') OR (p0 = '8' AND p1 = '8') OR (p0 = '9' AND p1 = '9') OR (p0 = '10' AND p1 = '10') OR (p0 = '11' AND p1 = '11') OR (p0 = '12' AND p1 = '12') OR (p0 = '13' AND p1 = '13') OR (p0 = '14' AND p1 = '14') OR (p0 = '15' AND p1 = '15') OR (p0 = '16' AND p1 = '16') OR (p0 = '17' AND p1 = '17') OR (p0 = '18' AND p1 = '18') OR (p0 = '19' AND p1 = '19') OR (p0 = '20' AND p1 = '20')\r\n```\r\nwill be converted into a long query(130K characters) in Hive metastore, and there will be error:\r\n```\r\njavax.jdo.JDOException: Exception thrown when executing query : SELECT DISTINCT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.model.MPartition' AS NUCLEUS_TYPE,A0.CREATE_TIME,A0.LAST_ACCESS_TIME,A0.PART_NAME,A0.PART_ID,A0.PART_NAME AS NUCORDER0 FROM PARTITIONS A0 LEFT OUTER JOIN TBLS B0 ON A0.TBL_ID = B0.TBL_ID LEFT OUTER JOIN DBS C0 ON B0.DB_ID = C0.DB_ID WHERE B0.TBL_NAME = ? AND C0.\"NAME\" = ? AND ((((((A0.PART_NAME LIKE '%/p1=1' ESCAPE '\\' ) OR (A0.PART_NAME LIKE '%/p1=2' ESCAPE '\\' )) OR (A0.PART_NAME LIKE '%/p1=3' ESCAPE '\\' )) OR ((A0.PART_NAME LIKE '%/p1=4' ESCAPE '\\' ) O ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nEssentially, we just need to traverse predicate and extract the convertible sub-predicates like what we did in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24598. There is no need to maintain the CNF result set.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nA better implementation for pushing down disjunctive and complex predicates. The pushed down predicates is always equal or shorter than the CNF result.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to port forward #29098 to `collectAsArrowToR`. `collectAsArrowToR` follows `collectAsArrowToPython` in branch-2.4 due to the limitation of ARROW-4512. SparkR vectorization currently cannot use streaming format.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor simplicity and consistency.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe same code is being tested in `collectAsArrowToPython` of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to just simply by-pass the case when the number of array size is negative, when it collects data from Spark DataFrame with no partitions for `toPandas` with Arrow optimization enabled.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.sparkContext.emptyRDD().toDF(\"col1 int\").toPandas()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the master and branch-3.0, this was fixed together at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/ecaa495b1fe532c36e952ccac42f4715809476af but it's legitimately not ported back.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make empty Spark DataFrame able to be a pandas DataFrame.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.sparkContext.emptyRDD().toDF(\"col1 int\").toPandas()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException\r\n\tat

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTo change SortMergeJoin orientation at runtime using adaptive query execution\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor SortMerge join of type EquiJoin, the left and right side of the joins are decided on the basis of the user order. In SMJ, the left side of the join is streamed and the right side is buffered (matching values). Because of this, B SMJ A would perform better than A SMJ B if, sizeOf(B) > sizeOf(A)\r\n\r\nWith adaptive query execution, once both ShuffleQueryStages corresponding to the join have completed and if none of them have sizes lesser than the broadcast threshold (the join will not be converted to BroadcastHashJoin), join orientation can be changed at run time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSeems like Jenkins machines came back to normal.

without depending on each other for dependency testing or Unidoc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor simplicity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark sql catalyst optimizer has a rule CollapseProject, it will try to collapse multi projects to a single one if possible. But the collapsed project may have more leaf expressions than the origin project. In the worst case the number of leaf expressions will grow \r\nexponentially, and will lead to driver oom. We could limit the max number of leaf expression a single project can have to prevent this. The logical is that if the project has more than 1000 leaf expressions, there is a risk to continue collapse it. So we think this single project is very complex and we stop collapse it. But other simple project can still collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nrefer to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24983 or the unit test added, collapse project optimizer may cause driver oom if leaf expressions grow exponentially.\r\nAs we can see in JIRA there is a closed PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21993 intend to fix this. There is a comment that we should black list \"case when\" in collapse project, but any kind of sql may lead to the memory problem(like the ut case), and there is a workaround to exclude the collapse project optimizer, but I think this rule is necessary which could improve performance. And it is hard to decide whether we should exclude this rule ahead of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a unit test to check whether the query collapse to two project. And all the existing UT passed in CollapseProjectSuite\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-14T03:59:28Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T00:39:58Z","closed_at":"2020-11-09T00:39:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa48e3072a242087b4dbd7ceac69945c7c08117c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06a0bcedc02b055d8f5a01989e05e2e2a27d8aca","head":{"label":"constzhou:SPARK-24983-limit-leaf-num","ref":"SPARK-24983-limit-leaf-num","sha":"06a0bcedc02b055d8f5a01989e05e2e2a27d8aca","user":{"login":"constzhou","id":5299740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5299740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou","html_url":"https://github.com/constzhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":279465577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk0NjU1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"constzhou/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"constzhou","id":5299740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5299740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou","html_url":"https://github.com/constzhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/constzhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/constzhou/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixing inconsistency between Spark memory configs and JVM option by adding the \"m\" default unit before setting Xmx/Xms JVM options when no suffix is provided.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark's maximum memory can be configured in several ways:\r\n\r\n- via Spark config\r\n- command line argument\r\n- environment variables\r\n\r\nBoth for executors and for the driver the memory can be configured separately. All of these are following the format of JVM memory configurations in a way they are using the very same size unit suffixes (\"k\", \"m\", \"g\" or \"t\") but there is an inconsistency regarding the default unit. When no suffix is given then the given amount is passed as it is to the JVM (to the -Xmx and -Xms options) where this memory options are using bytes as a default unit, for this please see the example [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html):\r\n\r\n> \r\n> The following examples show how to set the maximum allowed size of allocated memory to 80 MB using various units:\r\n> \r\n> -Xmx83886080 \r\n> -Xmx81920k \r\n> -Xmx80m\r\n\r\nAlthough the Spark memory config is in MiB.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, before this PR when no suffix was given the `XmX` and `Xms` JVM options could have been configured to the 1/1024 of the valid amount because of the conversion difference between the units (bytes and megabytes). \r\n\r\nThis could happen in only in client mode. So the followings are affected:\r\n- all the use cases when some kind of REPL is started: `spark-shell`, `spark-sql`, `pyspark`, `sparkR` and `beeline` as the result of the changes done in `SparkClassCommandBuilder`\r\n- application submits via the `spark-submit` (only in client mode) as the result of the changes done in `SparkSubmitCommandBuilder` \r\n\r\nThe fact the limit to start an application is 471859200 bytes (and this number is already long enough and inconvenient to calculate with) is decreasing the number of affected cases. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n####  With unit test\r\n\r\nSee `SparkSubmitCommandBuilderSuite`. \r\n\r\n#### With a manual testing\r\n\r\nBy executing a Spark example. \r\n\r\nWithout my change and without explicit suffix unit:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-submit  --driver-memory 500 --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi examples/target/original-spark-examples_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 1000\r\nError occurred during initialization of VM\r\nToo small initial heap\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see from the error above that it is not the Spark check for the memory is triggered as with the contra test (still without my change, but with suffix is given but a too low memory is set):\r\n```\r\n$  ./bin/spark-submit  --driver-memory 300m --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi examples/target/original-spark-examples_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 1000\r\n...\r\n20/07/13 20:51:15 ERROR SparkContext: Error initializing SparkContext.\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: System memory 301465600 must be at least 471859200.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove redundant sorts before repartition nodes whenever the data is ordered after the repartitioning. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt looks like our `EliminateSorts` rule can be extended further to remove sorts before repartition nodes that don't affect the final output ordering. It seems safe to perform the following rewrites:\r\n\r\n- `Sort -> Repartition -> Sort -> Scan` as `Sort -> Repartition -> Scan`\r\n- `Sort -> Repartition -> Project -> Sort -> Scan` as `Sort -> Repartition -> Project -> Scan`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMore test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor Spark SQL, it can't support script transform SQL with aggregationClause/windowClause/LateralView.\r\nThis case we can't directly migration Hive SQL to Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we treat all script transform statement's query part (exclude transform about part)  as a  separate query block and solve it as ScriptTransformation's child and pass a UnresolvedStart as ScriptTransform's input. Then in analyzer level, we pass child's output as ScriptTransform's input. Then we can support all kind of normal SELECT query combine with script transformation.\r\n\r\nSuch as transform with aggregation:\r\n```\r\nSELECT TRANSFORM ( d2, max(d1) as max_d1, sum(d3))\r\nUSING 'cat' AS (a,b,c)\r\nFROM script_trans\r\nWHERE d1 <= 100\r\nGROUP BY d2\r\n HAVING max_d1 > 0 \r\n```\r\nWhen we build AST, we treat it as\r\n```\r\nSELECT TRANSFORM (*)\r\nUSING 'cat' AS (a,b,c)\r\nFROM (\r\n     SELECT  d2, max(d1) as max_d1, sum(d3)\r\n     FROM script_trans\r\n    WHERE d1 <= 100\r\n    GROUP BY d2\r\n    HAVING max_d1 > 0 \r\n) tmp\r\n```\r\nthen in Analyzer's `ResolveReferences`, resolve `* (UnresolvedStar)`, then sql behavior like \r\n```\r\nSELECT TRANSFORM ( d2, max(d1) as max_d1, sum(d3))\r\nUSING 'cat' AS (a,b,c)\r\nFROM script_trans\r\nWHERE d1 <= 100\r\nGROUP BY d2\r\nHAVING max_d1 > 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbout UT, in this pr we add a lot of different SQL to check we can support all kind of such SQL and  each kind of expressions can work well, such as alias, case when, binary compute etc...\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport transform with aggregateClause/windowClause/LateralView etc , make sql migration more smoothly\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can write transform with  aggregateClause/windowClause/LateralView.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly proposes to run only relevant tests just like Jenkins PR builder does. Currently, GitHub Actions always run full tests which wastes the resources.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR also fixes 3 more issues  very closely related together while I am here.\r\n\r\n1. The main idea here is: It reuses the existing logic embedded in `dev/run-tests.py` which Jenkins PR builder use in order to run only the related test cases.\r\n\r\n2. While I am here, I fixed SPARK-32292 too to run the doc tests. It was because other references were not available when it is cloned via `checkout@v2`. With `fetch-depth: 0`, the history is available.\r\n\r\n3. In addition, it fixes the `dev/run-tests.py` to match with `python/run-tests.py` in terms of its options. Environment variables such as `TEST_ONLY_XXX` were moved as proper options. For example,\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    dev/run-tests.py --modules sql,core\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    which is consistent with `python/run-tests.py`, for example,\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    python/run-tests.py --modules pyspark-core,pyspark-ml\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Lastly, also fixed the formatting issue in module specification in the matrix:\r\n\r\n    ```diff\r\n    -            network_common, network_shuffle, repl, launcher\r\n    +            network-common, network-shuffle, repl, launcher,\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    which incorrectly runs build/test the modules.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBy running only related tests, we can hugely save the resources and avoid unrelated flaky tests, etc.\r\nAlso, now it runs the doctest of `dev/run-tests.py` properly, the usages are similar between `dev/run-tests.py` and `python/run-tests.py`, and run `network-common`, `network-shuffle`, `launcher` and `examples` modules too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in my own forked

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement script transformation in sql/core module\r\n\r\n * Renamed file `hive/execution/ScriptTransformationExec` to `hive/execution/HiveScriptTransformationExec` (rename file)\r\n * Implement `SparkScriptTransformationExec` based on `BaseScriptTransformationExec`\r\n* Implement  `SparkScriptTransformationWriterThread` based on `BaseScriptTransformationWriterThread` of writing data \r\n* Add rule `SparkScripts` to support convert script LogicalPlan to SparkPlan in Spark SQL (without hive mode)\r\n* Build a common suite  `BaseScriptTransformationSuite`\r\n* Add `SparkScriptTransformationSuite`\r\n\r\nIn these PR,  here offers a very limited support for ROW FORMAT DELIMITED format - it does not rely on a Hive's SerDe class.:\r\n* Input:  we treat all data  as `String` we cast data as string and pass to script, always in script we process data as string.\r\n* Output:  here we get input from script as string, and we build a fieldWrite for output type to convert string to corresponding  type of data.  and we can't support Array/Map/Struct and UserDefinedType now.\r\n```\r\nprivate lazy val fieldWriters: Seq[String => Any] = output.map { attr =>\r\n    val converter = CatalystTypeConverters.createToCatalystConverter(attr.dataType)\r\n    attr.dataType match {\r\n      case StringType => (data: String) => converter(data)\r\n      case ByteType => (data: String) => converter(data.toByte)\r\n      case IntegerType => (data: String) => converter(data.toInt)\r\n      case ShortType => (data: String) => converter(data.toShort)\r\n      case LongType => (data: String) => converter(data.toLong)\r\n      case FloatType => (data: String)

dataType: DataType => (data: String) => converter(data)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor current ScriptTrasformation with default serde, we can't support complext datatype (Map/Array/Struct) and \r\n spark's special datatype (TimestampType/CalanderIntervalType) too,  in\r\n\r\nAnd after this pr, @alfozan will raise a new pr to add two native SerDe classes (SimpleSerDe for ROW FORMAT DELIMITED and DelimitedJSONSerDe for the JSON variant), In that pr it will support handle Complex data type and spark's own special Type.\r\n\r\nOne more need to explain is that, in current code, the way to choose to use default or witch serde  method is not  the final way. it need to discusses more in next pr with spark's own serde.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport  run scrip in Spark\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can use script transform without hive support \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded UT\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-13T10:33:18Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T00:48:13Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T00:48:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e029605d8a2a8a35ed26214a3501057448d33f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29085/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29085/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29085/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03d3409f6ca641a4f10fdc2ac71479445220f676","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-32106","ref":"SPARK-32106","sha":"03d3409f6ca641a4f10fdc2ac71479445220f676","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI have added a `method` parameter to `CrossValidator.scala` to allow the user to choose between repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation (current behavior) and _k_-fold cross-validation (optional new behavior). The default method is random sub-sampling cross-validation.\r\n\r\nIf _k_-fold cross-validation is chosen, the new behavior is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of splitting the input dataset into _k_ training and validation sets, I split them into _k_ folds; for each fold of training, one of the _k_ splits is selected for validation, and the others are unioned together for training.\r\n2. Instead of caching each training and validation set _k_ times, I cache each of the folds once.\r\n3. Instead of waiting for every model to finish training on fold _n_ before moving on to fold _n+1_, new fold/model combinations will be trained as soon as resources are available.\r\n4. Instead of creating one `Future` per model for each fold in series, all `Future`s for each fold & parameter grid pair are created and trained in parallel.\r\n5. A new `Int` parameter is added to the `Future` (now `Future[Int, Double]` instead of `Future[Double]`) in order to keep track of which `Future` belongs to which parameter grid.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes allow the user to choose between repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation (current behavior) and _k_-fold cross-validation (optional new behavior). These changes:\r\n1. Allow the user to choose between two types of cross-validation.\r\n2. (If _k_-fold is chosen) Only require caching the entire dataset once (instead of _k_ times in repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation, as it does now).\r\n3. (If _k_-fold is chosen) Free resources to train new model/fold combinations as soon as the previous one finishes. Currently, a model can only train one fold at a time. If _k_-fold is chosen, the added functionality will allow the `fit` to train multiple folds at once for the same model, and, in the case of a grid search, allow it to train multiple model/fold combinations at once, without needing to wait for the slowest model to fit the first fold before moving onto the second.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. This PR introduces the `setMethod` method to `CrossValidator`. If the `method` parameter is not set, the behavior will be the same as it has always been.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBased on a follow up comment in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28123, where we can coalesce buckets for shuffled hash join as well. The note here is we only coalesce the buckets from shuffled hash join stream side (i.e. the side not building hash map), so we don't need to worry about OOM when coalescing multiple buckets in one task for building hash map.\r\n\r\n> If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n\r\nRefactor existing physical plan rule `CoalesceBucketsInSortMergeJoin` to `CoalesceBucketsInJoin`, for covering shuffled hash join as well.\r\nRefactor existing unit test `CoalesceBucketsInSortMergeJoinSuite` to `CoalesceBucketsInJoinSuite`, for covering shuffled hash join as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid shuffle for joining different bucketed tables, is also useful for shuffled hash join. In production, we are seeing users to use shuffled hash join to join bucketed tables (set `spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin`=false, to avoid sort), and this can help avoid shuffle if number of buckets are not same.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests in `CoalesceBucketsInJoinSuite` for verifying shuffled hash join physical plan.\r\n\r\n### Performance number per request from @maropu \r\n\r\nI was looking at TPCDS per suggestion from @maropu. But I found most of queries from TPCDS are doing aggregate, and only several ones are doing join. None of input tables are bucketed. So I took the approach to test a modified version of `TPCDS q93` as \r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ss_ticket_number, sr_ticket_number\r\nFROM store_sales\r\nJOIN store_returns\r\nON ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAnd make `store_sales` and `store_returns` to be bucketed tables.\r\n\r\nPhysical query plan without coalesce:\r\n\r\n```\r\nShuffledHashJoin [ss_ticket_number#109L],

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis removes the undocumented and incomplete feature of \"stateful aggregation\" in continuous mode, which would reduce 1100+ lines of code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe work for the feature had been stopped for over an year, and no one asked/requested for the availability of such feature in community. Current state for the feature is that it only works with `coalesce(1)` which force the query to read and process, and write in \"a\" task, which doesn't make sense in production.\r\n\r\nThe remaining code increases the work on DSv2 changes as well - that's why I don't simply propose reverting relevant commits - the code path has been changed due to DSv2 evolution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nTechnically no, because it's never documented and can't be used in production in current shape.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2020-07-12T20:42:04Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T07:00:48Z","closed_at":"2020-07-15T04:40:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3c392e6dc5d84480e7bb9413dbfb0f9bc228efad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28805, predicates are converted into CNF for partition pruning.  However, the CNF result can be very long and the Hive metastore will fail to execute it.\r\nFor example, the following partition filter:\r\n```\r\n(p0 = '1' AND p1 = '1') OR (p0 = '2' AND p1 = '2') OR (p0 = '3' AND p1 = '3') OR (p0 = '4' AND p1 = '4') OR (p0 = '5' AND p1 = '5') OR (p0 = '6' AND p1 = '6') OR (p0 = '7' AND p1 = '7') OR (p0 = '8' AND p1 = '8') OR (p0 = '9' AND p1 = '9') OR (p0 = '10' AND p1 = '10') OR (p0 = '11' AND p1 = '11') OR (p0 = '12' AND p1 = '12') OR (p0 = '13' AND p1 = '13') OR (p0 = '14' AND p1 = '14') OR (p0 = '15' AND p1 = '15') OR (p0 = '16' AND p1 = '16') OR (p0 = '17' AND p1 = '17') OR (p0 = '18' AND p1 = '18') OR (p0 = '19' AND p1 = '19') OR (p0 = '20' AND p1 = '20')\r\n```\r\nwill be converted into a long query(130K characters) in Hive metastore, and there will be error:\r\n\r\n```\r\njavax.jdo.JDOException: Exception thrown when executing query : SELECT DISTINCT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.model.MPartition' AS NUCLEUS_TYPE,A0.CREATE_TIME,A0.LAST_ACCESS_TIME,A0.PART_NAME,A0.PART_ID,A0.PART_NAME AS NUCORDER0 FROM PARTITIONS A0 LEFT OUTER JOIN TBLS B0 ON A0.TBL_ID = B0.TBL_ID LEFT OUTER JOIN DBS C0 ON B0.DB_ID = C0.DB_ID WHERE B0.TBL_NAME = ? AND C0.\"NAME\" = ? AND ((((((A0.PART_NAME LIKE '%/p1=1' ESCAPE '\\' ) OR (A0.PART_NAME LIKE '%/p1=2' ESCAPE '\\' )) OR (A0.PART_NAME LIKE '%/p1=3' ESCAPE '\\' )) OR ((A0.PART_NAME LIKE '%/p1=4' ESCAPE '\\' ) O ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo mitigating the regression due to the previous improvement https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28805:\r\n1. We should push down the convertible original queries as they are, instead of converting all predicates into CNF\r\n2.

While its possible to increase the heap size to workaround, Spark should be resilient to such issues as skews can happen arbitrarily.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

was a dead simple change that I lightly tested to determine if there\r\nwas actually a performance increase. Turns out, yes there is (at least locally).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs per the issue SPARK-27892, the saving & loading of files was being done sequentially in the SharedReadWrite object which would clearly make loading large models quite slow. The enhancement simply creates a new ParArray & converts the existing stage array into a parallel array by calling \".par\". When passed into the foreach / mapper phases it is automatically parallelized. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis only serves to speed up load times of pipelines with many stages. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI tested it by using the example provided in SPARK-27892. I also added a load step to verify that worked correctly. \r\n\r\n`import org.apache.spark.ml._\r\ndef time[R](block : => R): R = {\r\nval start = System.nanoTime()\r\nval result = block\r\nval end = System.nanoTime()\r\nprintln(\"elap time: \" + (end - start) + \"ns\")\r\nresult\r\n}\r\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler\r\nval outputPath = \"boopcity\"\r\nval stages = (1 to 100) map { i => new VectorAssembler().setInputCols(Array(\"input\")).setOutputCol(\"o\" + i)}\r\nval p = new Pipeline().setStages(stages.toArray)\r\nval data = Seq(1, 1, 1) toDF \"input\"\r\nval pm = p.fit(data)\r\nval result = time { pm.write.overwrite().save(outputPath) }\r\nval sameModel = time{ PipelineModel.load(outputPath) }`\r\n\r\nI compared the execution time within Scala by running 4 runs for both the sequential and parallel version. \r\nThe raw \"data\"\r\npara:\r\n        save: 11294731300ns\r\n                 11211858600ns\r\n                   7047186600ns\r\n                   6382136700ns\r\n\r\n           mean: 8983978300ns\r\n\r\n\r\n        load:  6909773600ns\r\n                15572318900ns\r\n                  5430449700ns\r\n                  4499734100ns\r\n\r\n           mean: 8103069075ns\r\n\r\n\r\nseq:\r\n        save: 43879181600ns\r\n                 27545280700ns\r\n                 24504610300ns\r\n                 23568721400ns\r\n\r\n           mean: \r\n\r\n        load: 27151395000ns\r\n                 20363685700ns\r\n                 15923967900ns\r\n                 15889010200ns\r\n\r\n\r\npara:\r\n       save:    8983978300ns\r\n       load:    8103069075ns\r\n\r\nseq:\r\n       save:  20029586625ns\r\n       load:  19832014700ns\r\n\r\nDecreasing times are likely contributed to the data simply being cached on faster portions of the SSD in my machine so the average isn't super meaningful but consistently we see that the parallel version is far faster than sequential. \r\n \r\nAdditionally, I ran the entire mllib testsuite on the changes with all test passing. Testing on a cluster is likely worth doing but I don't have the resources to do that at the moment. \r\n\r\nThere is no way to add a unit test to do this without adding an additional function which doesn't isn't done in parallel which seems like a waste of time & effort to add.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a config to let users change how SQL/Dataframe data is compressed when cached.\r\n\r\nThis adds a few new classes/APIs for use with this config.\r\n\r\n1. `CachedBatch` is a trait used to tag data that is intended to be cached. It has a few APIs that lets us keep the compression/serialization of the data separate from the metrics about it.\r\n2. `CachedBatchSerializer` provides the APIs that must be implemented to cache data.\r\n    * `convertInternalRowToCachedBatch` is an API that takes an `RDD[InternalRow]` and turns its result into an `RDD[CachedBatch]`.  The actual caching is done outside of this API\r\n   * `convertColumnarBatchToCachedBatch` does the same thing, but takes an `RDD[ColumnarBatch]` instead.\r\n   * `supportsColumnarInput` is used to check if an `RDD[ColumnarBatch]` can be used as input or not.  If it returns false `convertInternalRowToCachedBatch` will be called.  If it returns true either API might be called depending on the physical plan being cached.\r\n   * `buildFilter` is an API that takes a set of predicates and builds a filter function that can be used to filter the `RDD[CachedBatch]` before it is read.  This can avoid the cost of decompressing unneeded data in some cases.\r\n   * `supportsColumnarOutput` determines if  `convertCachedBatchToColumnarBatch` or `convertCachedBatchToInternalRow` should be called/\r\n   * `convertCachedBatchToColumnarBatch` converts an `RDD[CachedBatch]` into an `RDD[ColumnarBatch]`.\r\n   * `convertCachedBatchToInternalRow` converts an `RDD[CachedBatch]` into an `RDD[InternalRow]`.\r\n\r\nThere is also an API that lets you reuse the current filtering based on min/max values. `SimpleMetricsCachedBatch` and `SimpleMetricsCachedBatchSerializer`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis lets users explore different types of compression and compression ratios.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis adds in a single config, and exposes some developer API classes described above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI ran the unit tests around this and I also did some manual performance tests.  I could find any performance difference between the old and new code, and if there is any it is within error.","created_at":"2020-07-10T18:19:51Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T15:05:05Z","closed_at":"2020-08-03T03:16:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7fb94be1dd4a9076d55f554de29138d0898ff57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3f2f5278c7e8c05e32a5f54ddba1251250dfdca3","head":{"label":"revans2:pluggable_cache_serializer","ref":"pluggable_cache_serializer","sha":"3f2f5278c7e8c05e32a5f54ddba1251250dfdca3","user":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190236548,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTAyMzY1NDg=","name":"spark","full_name":"revans2/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"revans2","id":3441321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDEzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3441321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2","html_url":"https://github.com/revans2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/revans2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/revans2/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the core part of the [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0NsQSryvNmXBY9kcvfINeYyKC-AahZarUqg3nS1GQs/edit#) for SPARK-23889.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This PR contains all changes in one place to simplify the review. Once we agree on the approach, I am going to split it into smaller PRs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nData sources should be able to request a specific distribution and ordering of data on write. In particular, these scenarios are considered useful:\r\n- global sort\r\n- cluster data and sort within partitions\r\n- local sort within partitions\r\n- no sort\r\n\r\nPlease see the design doc above for a more detailed explanation of requirements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces public changes to the DS V2 by adding a logical write abstraction as we have on the read path as well as additional interfaces to represent distribution and ordering of data (please see the doc for more info).\r\n\r\nImportant pieces:\r\n- `Write` - a logical representation of a data source write\r\n- `RequiresDistributionAndOrdering` - a write that requires a specific distribution/ordering\r\n- `V2Writes` - a rule that constructs a logical write and inserts repartition/sort nodes\r\n- `WriteDistributionAndOrderingSuite` - a test case with samples\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe patch comes with a new test case.","created_at":"2020-07-10T18:12:15Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T08:55:25Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T08:55:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c0f47449faeed5f7052f449dc2c20ef030f6244","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use text datasource in CSV's schema inference. This shares the same reasons of SPARK-18362, SPARK-19885 and SPARK-19918 - we're currently using Hadoop RDD when the encoding is different, which is unnecessary. This PR completes SPARK-18362, and address the comment at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15813#discussion_r90751405.\r\n\r\nWe should better keep the code paths consistent with existing CSV and JSON datasources as well, but this CSV schema inference with the encoding specified is different alone.\r\n\r\nThere can be another story that this PR might lead to a bug fix: Spark session configurations, say Hadoop configurations, are not respected during CSV schema inference when the encoding is different (but it has to be set to Spark context for schema inference when the encoding is different).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor consistency, potentially better performance, and fixing a potentially very corner case bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nVirtually no.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-10T09:25:27Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:43:43Z","closed_at":"2020-07-12T16:44:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bce95f15ff93f63b154697dd481c54f4d81dff39","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29063/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29063/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29063/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3250f33ce734091817b25791c03d9d40490fc3e8","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32270","ref":"SPARK-32270","sha":"3250f33ce734091817b25791c03d9d40490fc3e8","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to let `NormalizeFloatingNumbers` rule directly normalizes on certain children expressions. It could simplify expression tree.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently NormalizeFloatingNumbers rule treats some expressions as black box but we can optimize it a bit by normalizing directly the inner children expressions. \r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28962#discussion_r448526240.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

pyspark.sql.utils.IllegalArgumentException: MultilayerPerceptronClassifier_dec859ed24ec parameter solver given invalid value auto.\r\n```\r\nFMClassifier/Regression and GeneralizedLinearRegression have the same problems.\r\n\r\nHere are the root cause of the problems:\r\n1. In HasSolver, both Scala and Python default solver to 'auto'\r\n\r\n2. On Scala side, mlp overrides the default of solver to 'l-bfgs', FMClassifier/Regression overrides the default of solver to 'adamW', and glr overrides the default of solver to 'irls'\r\n\r\n3. On Scala side, mlp overrides the default of solver in MultilayerPerceptronClassificationParams, so both MultilayerPerceptronClassification and MultilayerPerceptronClassificationModel have 'l-bfgs' as default\r\n\r\n4. On Python side, mlp overrides the default of solver in MultilayerPerceptronClassification, so it has default as 'l-bfgs', but MultilayerPerceptronClassificationModel doesn't override the default so it gets the default from HasSolver which is 'auto'. In theory, we don't care about the solver value or any other params values for MultilayerPerceptronClassificationModel, because we have the fitted model already. That's why on Python side, we never set default values for any of the XXXModel. \r\n\r\n5. when calling getSolver on the loaded mlp model, it calls this line of code underneath:\r\n```\r\n    def _transfer_params_from_java(self):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Transforms the embedded params from the companion Java object.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        ......\r\n                # SPARK-14931: Only check set params back to avoid default params mismatch.\r\n                if self._java_obj.isSet(java_param):\r\n                    value = _java2py(sc, self._java_obj.getOrDefault(java_param))\r\n                    self._set(**{param.name: value})\r\n        ......\r\n```\r\nthat's why model2.getSolver() returns 'auto'. The code doesn't get the default Scala value (in this case 'l-bfgs') to set to Python param, so it takes the default value (in this case 'auto') on Python side.\r\n\r\n6. when calling model2.transform(df), it calls this underneath:\r\n```\r\n    def _transfer_params_to_java(self):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Transforms the embedded params to the companion Java object.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        ......\r\n            if self.hasDefault(param):\r\n                pair = self._make_java_param_pair(param, self._defaultParamMap[param])\r\n                pair_defaults.append(pair)\r\n        ......\r\n\r\n```\r\nAgain, it gets the Python default solver which is 'auto', and this caused the Exception\r\n\r\n7. Currently, on Scala side, for some of the algorithms, we set default values in the XXXParam, so both estimator and transformer get the default value. However, for some of the algorithms, we only set default in estimators, and the XXXModel doesn't get the default value. On Python side, we never set defaults for the XXXModel. This causes the default value inconsistency.\r\n\r\n8. My proposed solution: set default params in XXXParam for both Scala and Python, so both the estimator and transformer have the same default value for both Scala and Python. I currently only changed solver in this PR. If everyone is OK with the fix, I will change all the other params as well.\r\n\r\nI hope my explanation makes sense to your folks :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nForce to initialize Hadoop VersionInfo in HiveExternalCatalog to make sure Hive can get the Hadoop version when using the isolated

to set `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars` to specify jars to access Hive Metastore. These jars are loaded by the isolated classloader. Because we also share Hadoop classes with the isolated classloader, the user doesn't need to add Hadoop jars to `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars`, which means when we are using the isolated classloader, hadoop-common jar is not available in this case. If Hadoop VersionInfo is not initialized before we switch to the isolated classloader, and we try to initialize it using the isolated classloader (the current thread context classloader), it will fail

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-14067. But since we are still supporting old Hadoop versions, we should fix it.\r\n\r\nWhy this issue starts to happen in Spark 3.0.0?\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.4.x, we use Hive 1.2.1 by default. It will trigger `VersionInfo` initialization in the static codes of `Hive` class. This will happen when we load `HiveClientImpl` class because `HiveClientImpl.clent` method refers to `Hive` class. At this moment, the thread context classloader is not using the isolcated classloader, so it can access hadoop-common jar on the classpath and initialize it correctly.\r\n\r\nIn Spark 3.0.0, we use Hive 2.3.7. The static codes of `Hive` class are not accessing `VersionInfo` because of the change in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11657. Instead, accessing `VersionInfo` happens when creating a `Hive` object (See the above stack trace). This happens here https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.0.0/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L260. But we switch to the isolated classloader before calling `HiveClientImpl.client` (See https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.0.0/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L283). This is exactly what I mentioned above: `If Hadoop VersionInfo is not initialized before we switch to the isolated classloader, and we try to initialize it using the isolated classloader (the current thread context classloader), it will fail`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new regression test added in this PR.\r\n\r\nNote that the new UT doesn't fail with the default profiles (-Phadoop-3.2) because it's already fixed at Hadoop 3.1. Please use the following to verify this.\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive \"hive/testOnly

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs previously mentioned, there is a JIRA request, SPARK-32035, which encapsulates all the issues. But, in summary, the naming of items was inconsistent. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nCorrect names:\r\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\r\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\r\nAWS_SESSION_TOKEN\r\nThese are the same that AWS uses in their libraries.\r\n\r\nHowever, looking through the Spark documentation and comments, I see that these are not denoted correctly across the board:\r\n\r\ndocs/cloud-integration.md\r\n106:1. `spark-submit` reads the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY` <-- both different\r\n107:and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables and sets the associated authentication options\r\n\r\ndocs/streaming-kinesis-integration.md\r\n232:- Set up the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` with your AWS credentials. <-- secret key different\r\n\r\nexternal/kinesis-asl/src/main/python/examples/streaming/kinesis_wordcount_asl.py\r\n34: $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>\r\n35: $ export AWS_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key> <-- different\r\n48: Environment Variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_KEY <-- secret key different\r\n\r\ncore/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkHadoopUtil.scala\r\n438: val keyId = System.getenv(\"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\")\r\n439: val accessKey = System.getenv(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\")\r\n448: val sessionToken = System.getenv(\"AWS_SESSION_TOKEN\")\r\n\r\nexternal/kinesis-asl/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/streaming/KinesisWordCountASL.scala\r\n53: * $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>\r\n54: * $ export AWS_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key> <-- different\r\n65: * Environment Variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_KEY <-- secret key different\r\n\r\nexternal/kinesis-asl/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/examples/streaming/JavaKinesisWordCountASL.java\r\n59: * $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[your-access-key]\r\n60: * $ export AWS_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key> <-- different\r\n71: * Environment Variables - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_KEY <-- secret key different\r\n\r\nThese were all fixed to match names listed under the \"correct names\" heading. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI built the documentation using jekyll and verified that the changes were present & accurate.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to run the Spark tests in Github Actions.\r\n\r\nTo briefly explain the main idea:\r\n\r\n- Reuse `dev/run-tests.py` with SBT build\r\n- Reuse the modules in `dev/sparktestsupport/modules.py` to test each module\r\n- Pass the modules to test into `dev/run-tests.py` directly via `TEST_ONLY_MODULES` environment variable. For example, `pyspark-sql,core,sql,hive`.\r\n- `dev/run-tests.py` _does not_ take the dependent modules into account but solely the specified modules to test.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note might be `SlowHiveTest` annotation. Running the tests in Hive modules takes too much so the slow tests are extracted and it runs as a separate job. It was extracted from the actual elapsed time in Jenkins:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-07-09 at 7 48 13 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/87050238-f6098e80-c238-11ea-9c4a-ab505af61381.png)\r\n\r\nSo, Hive tests are separated into to jobs. One is slow test cases, and the other one is the other test cases.\r\n\r\n_Note that_ the current GitHub Actions build virtually copies what the default PR builder on Jenkins does (without other profiles such as JDK 11, Hadoop 2, etc.). The only exception is Kinesis https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29057/files#diff-04eb107ee163a50b61281ca08f4e4c7bR23 \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLast week and onwards, the Jenkins machines became very unstable for many reasons:\r\n  - Apparently, the machines became extremely slow. Almost all tests can't pass.\r\n  - One machine (worker 4) started to have the corrupt `.m2` which fails the build.\r\n  - Documentation build fails time to time for an unknown reason in Jenkins machine specifically. This is disabled for now at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29017.\r\n  - Almost all PRs are basically blocked by this instability currently.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of using Github Actions:\r\n  - To avoid depending on few persons who can access to the cluster. \r\n  - To reduce the elapsed time in the build - we could split the tests (e.g., SQL, ML, CORE), and run them in parallel so the total build time will significantly reduce.\r\n  - To control the environment more flexibly.\r\n  - Other contributors can test and propose to fix Github Actions configurations so we can distribute this build management cost.\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n- The current build in Jenkins takes _more than 7 hours_.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen we create a UDAF function use class extended `UserDefinedAggregeteFunction`,  when we call the function,  in support hive mode, in HiveSessionCatalog, it will call super.makeFunctionExpression, \r\n\r\nbut it will catch error  such as the function need 2 parameter and we only give 1, throw exception only show \r\n```\r\nNo handler for UDF/UDAF/UDTF xxxxxxxx\r\n```\r\nThis is confused for develop , we should show error thrown by super method too, \r\n\r\nFor this pr's UT :\r\nBefore change, throw Exception like \r\n```\r\nNo handler for UDF/UDAF/UDTF 'org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.LongProductSum'; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\nAfter this pr, throw exception\r\n```\r\nSpark UDAF Error: Invalid number of arguments for function longProductSum. Expected: 2; Found: 1;\r\nHive UDF/UDAF/UDTF Error: No handler for UDF/UDAF/UDTF 'org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.LongProductSum'; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nShow more detail error message when define UDAF\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nPeople will see more detail error message when use spark sql's UDAF  in

provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nBefore applying this change, we can almost always reproduce the issue with the following command.\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --master \"local-cluster[10, 1, 1024]\" \r\nscala> :q\r\n```\r\nI confirmed no more exception thrown after this change with the same command shown

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the test failure due to the missing when statements for destination path. Note that it didn't fail on master branch, because 245aee9 got rid of size call in destination path, but still good to not depend on 245aee9.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe build against branch-3.0 / branch-2.4 starts to fail after merging SPARK-32024 (#28859) and this patch will fix it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan modified UT against master / branch-3.0 / branch-2.4.","created_at":"2020-07-08T23:29:19Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T06:47:50Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T06:47:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f451c340e4e06ed4a0a9e317de377daa2c687f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29048/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29048/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29048/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/19ecdee98374ad1a5f7f252738efefb36ddfaf31","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:QUICKFIX-SPARK-32024-branch-2.4","ref":"QUICKFIX-SPARK-32024-branch-2.4","sha":"19ecdee98374ad1a5f7f252738efefb36ddfaf31","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the test failure due to the missing when statements for destination path. Note that it didn't fail on master branch, because 245aee9 got rid of size call in destination path, but still good to not depend on 245aee9.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe build against branch-3.0 / branch-2.4 starts to fail after merging SPARK-32024 (#28859) and this patch will fix it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan modified UT against master / branch-3.0 /

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the test failure due to the missing when statements for destination path. Note that it didn't fail on master branch, because 245aee9 got rid of size call in destination path, but still good to not depend on 245aee9.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe build against branch-3.0 / branch-2.4 starts to fail after merging SPARK-32024 (#28859) and this patch will fix it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan modified UT against master / branch-3.0 /
