This can get problematic when the inner query groups using a high cardinality dimension, returning too many records for broker node to handle. One of the options that we have been internally testing and exploring is the capability to push down the complete nested query to the historical nodes. Each historical node then will execute the nested query primarily dealing with the segments it owns for that query. Because the number of records returned by each historical node would potentially be much smaller in this case, it would be less intensive for the broker to perform the final merge and aggregation. The broker though won't need to perform any more dimension or segment level filtering since it will be taken care of at the historical nodes itself. Note that this way of distributing the aggregation to the historical nodes doesn't always return the same results as the final aggregation getting done on the broker node. However, there is a good set of cases (for ex - aggregating on dimensions that are used for hashing during ingestion) where this kind of push down logic will return the right results. I can get into this into more detail but the general idea was to leave the onus on the user to figure out if their data layout allows for this kind of push down.\r\n\r\nThis implementation provides user a way of forcing nested query execution through a query context variable. The next cut will focus on doing this automatically under the following conditions (credit to @gianm ) for clearly articulating the following:\r\n\r\nThe groupBy query granularity is equal to, or finer than, segment granularity;\r\nand either:\r\n\r\n2a) A time chunk uses HashBasedNumberedShardSpec, partitionDimensions is nonempty, the grouping dimension set contains all of the shard partitionDimensions, and there are no \"extension\" partitions (partitions with partitionNum >= partitions, which are created by ingest tasks that append data)\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n2b) A time chunk uses SingleDimensionShardSpec and the grouping dimension set contains the shard dimension.\r\n\r\nIf Druid detects this it should push down the query automatically for that time chunk. There will be situations where the query can be pushed down for some time chunks but not others (for example: consider a data pipeline that loads data unpartitioned in realtime, and later has a reindexing job to partition historical data by some useful dimension). In this case, ideally the broker should be capable of pushing down the query for the time chunks where it can be correctly pushed down, and not pushing it down for others.\r\n\r\nTODO: support \"subtotalspec\" for push down nested queries.","created_at":"2018-10-01T20:38:27Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T19:03:57Z","closed_at":"2018-10-01T20:55:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c3aca63c747583d1ad76729c7db9ab03f01b25b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6410/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6410/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6410/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/649a6c1df1edb9d636d2cffe898cd300ff5d6e7c","head":{"label":"samarthjain:pushdown","ref":"pushdown","sha":"649a6c1df1edb9d636d2cffe898cd300ff5d6e7c","user":{"login":"samarthjain","id":1642180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain","html_url":"https://github.com/samarthjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118670762,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTg2NzA3NjI=","name":"druid","full_name":"samarthjain/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"samarthjain","id":1642180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain","html_url":"https://github.com/samarthjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samarthjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/samarthjain/druid","description":"Column

#4826 and #5128 \r\n\r\nIt should be easy to use QueryMetrics from different threads for scenario like JDBC. The doc says \"DefaultQueryMetrics's ownerThread should be reassigned explicitly\", but it is not clear how best to do that.\r\n\r\nI propose to make QueryMetrics thread safe so that it could be used in different threads with minimum effort. One case directly benefiting from the design is that the [yielderOpenCloseExecutor hack](#4415) could be removed. It also solves the above issues instantly.\r\n\r\nleventov has pointed out one drawback of making QueryMetrics thread-safe\r\n\r\n> making QueryMetrics thread-safe is inherently wrong thing to do. Instead of failing with ConcurrentModificationException, multiple threads will override metrics of each other. Nobody would understand what is going on and if the metrics are trustworthy or not.\r\n\r\nBut I think it's also possible to catch bugs earlier with thread-safe QueryMetrics. For example, DefaultQueryMetrics can log an error if different values are added to the same dimension or metric.\r\n\r\n@leventov @gianm @jon-wei what do you

PR introduces the `SegmentId` class for operating with segment ids in the codebase instead of Strings.\r\n\r\nThree reasons:\r\n - Memory efficiency: `SegmentId`'s footprint is about 50 bytes smaller than a String, assuming non-compressed Oops, if I calculated correctly (should be ~25 bytes smaller since Java 9's \"compact strings\"). The difference should be bigger with compressed Oops.\r\n - Code readability and safety: it's more readable and safer to operate with `Map<SegmentId, Something>` than with `Map<String, Something>`\r\n - `SegmentId` enabled to get rid of the `segments` map in `DruidServer` and `ImmutableDruidServer`, for additional memory savings.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n - Replaced `ConcurrentSkipListMap` with `ConcurrentHashMap` in `DruidDataSource`, because it doesn't really need to be sorted.\r\n - Improved concurrency of `DruidServer`.\r\n - Improved concurrency of `SQLMetadataSegmentManager`.\r\n\r\nCaveats of `SegmentId` introduction:\r\n - HTTP endpoints that return a lot of segment ids as parts of some JSON answers generate more garbage, because they convert `SegmentId` objects into Strings. Previously, those Strings were already stored in the heap.\r\n - HTTP endpoints which accept segment id need to do more work, because they need to iterate all possible parsings of a segment id string into `SegmentId`, that is ambiguous. But this should be minor, compared to the cost of an HTTP call itself. The exception is `MetadataResource.getDatabaseSegmentDataSourceSegment()`: to preserve it's former behaviour precisely, it would require to generate quite a lot of garbage `String` objects on each endpoint call, so the logic of this endpoint was changed (see below).\r\n\r\nChanged HTTP endpoint behaviour:\r\n - `MetadataResource.getDatabaseSegmentDataSourceSegment()`, `/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments/{segmentId}`: it used to search for segment id match ignoring the case of the string (for reference, it dates back to this commit: https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/commit/3cba0c8ff2ab89e20e0707cd4f585e0aab2e0e90#diff-1fad8d6f3e6e3a17b71cd63bd21353e9R153), that's not in line with all other segmentId-accepting endpoints, and to me it doesn't look correct, because `\"ver\"` and `\"VER\"` are two different versions according to the rest of the logic. In the PR, the endpoint is changed to look for case-sensitive segmentId match.\r\n - `DatasourcesResource.getSegmentDataSourceSpecificInterval()`, `/{dataSourceName}/intervals/{interval}`, `simple` option: it creates a `HashMap` of intervals, unlike same method, `full` option, and both `simple` and `full` options of `getSegmentDataSourceIntervals()`, which all create `TreeMap`s of intervals. To me it looked like a slip, so I changed this endpoint to create a `TreeMap` as well (i. e. return interval JSON maps in different order the endpoint does currently).\r\n\r\nThis PR is labelled `Incompatible` because it changed multiple Public APIs (to return `SegmentId` instead of `String` from some

PR promotes the `druid-parquet-extensions` module from 'contrib' to 'core' and introduces a new hadoop parser that is not based on converting to avro first, instead using the `SimpleGroup` based reference implementation of the `parquet-column` package of `parquet-mr`. This is likely not be the best or most efficient way to parse and convert parquet files... but its raw structure suited my needs of supporting converting `int96` timestamp columns into longs (for #5150) and additionally provide the ability to support a `flattenSpec`.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* `druid-parquet-extensions` now provides 2 types of hadoop parsers, `parquet` and `parquet-avro`, which use `org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.simple.DruidParquetInputFormat` and `org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.avro.DruidParquetAvroInputFormat` hadoop input formats respectively. \r\n* `parquet` and `parquet-avro` parsers now both support `flattenSpec` by specifying `parquet` and `avro` in the `parseSpec` respectively. `parquet-avro` re-uses the `druid-avro-extensions` spec and flattener. There may be minor behavior differences in how parquet logical types are handled.\r\n* extracted abstract type `NestedDataParseSpec<TFlattenSpec>` for ParseSpecs which support a `flattenSpec` property, used by `JSONParseSpec`, `AvroParseSpec`, and `ParquetParseSpec` (also introduced in this PR)\r\n* lightly modified behavior of `avro` flattener auto field discovery to be more discerning about arrays (only primitive arrays are now considered) and to allow nullable primitive fields to be picked up. The array thing might need to be called out, since previously it would have the `toString` array contents of complex types, which I don't think is correct behavior, but could trip up anyone relying on that to happen.\r\n* adds many tests and parquet test files (\"donated\" from [spark-sql tests here](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/sql/core/src/test/resources/test-data)) to ensure conversion correctness (though probably still not enough)\r\n\r\nOn top of all of the added tests, I've lightly tested both parsers on a local druid/hadoop cluster on my laptop. \r\n\r\nFixes #5150

this feature, a Historical node can be put in maintenance mode, by adding it to `historicalNodesInMaintenance` in Druid Coordinator dynamic config. Coordinator will move segments from such nodes with a specified priority `nodesInMaintenancePriority`. That allows to move segments from nodes which will be replaced afterwards avoiding availability issues which could be caused by abrupt shutdown. \r\nIssue https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/3247\r\n\r\nThis design suggests Coordinator as the container of the maintenance list which requires minimal changes to the current codebase (DruidCoordinatorBalancer, LoadRule).\r\nAn alternative design, where Historical nodes contain maintenance flag, will require, I expect,\r\ndouble amount of code, as a separate thread will need to get that data from Historical nodes via an HTTP endpoint. Introducing the variable to DruidNode, seems awkward, as DruidNode is defined during service startup only, and changing this will require even greater amount of code and unit-test coverage.\r\nSo my design gives the same functionality for less amount of time. The second approach is actually an extension to my design and can be implemented at the next stage.\r\nThe initial design has only one flaw: if a Historical node is restarted the resource manager can assign a different port to the Historical node, which requires from the operator to update the maintenance list manually. This is quite rare but possible.

related to https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/4937\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThere is currently a race condition in IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter that can lead to exceptions like the following, when running queries with filters on String dimensions that hit realtime tasks: \r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE: id[5] >= maxId[5]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.StringDimensionIndexer$1IndexerDimensionSelector.lookupName(StringDimensionIndexer.java:591)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.StringDimensionIndexer$1IndexerDimensionSelector$2.matches(StringDimensionIndexer.java:562)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.incremental.IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter$IncrementalIndexCursor.advance(IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter.java:284)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the `filterMatcher` is created in the constructor of `IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter.IncrementalIndexCursor`, `StringDimensionIndexer.makeDimensionSelector` gets called eventually, which calls:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal int maxId = getCardinality();\r\n...\r\n\r\n @Override\r\n  public int getCardinality()\r\n  {\r\n    return dimLookup.size();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `maxId` is set to the size of the dictionary at the time that the `filterMatcher` is created.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `maxRowIndex` which is meant to prevent the Cursor from returning rows that were added after the Cursor was created (see https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/4049) is set after the `filterMatcher` is created.\r\n\r\nIf rows with new dictionary values are added after the `filterMatcher` is created but before `maxRowIndex` is set, then it is possible for the Cursor to return rows that contain the new values, which will have `id >= maxId`.\r\n\r\nThis PR sets `maxRowIndex` before creating the `filterMatcher` to prevent rows with unknown dictionary IDs from being passed to the `filterMatcher`.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe included test triggers the error with a custom Filter + DruidPredicateFactory.\r\n\r\nThe DimensionSelector for predicate-based filter matching is created here in `Filters.makeValueMatcher`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public static ValueMatcher makeValueMatcher(\r\n      final ColumnSelectorFactory columnSelectorFactory,\r\n      final String columnName,\r\n      final DruidPredicateFactory predicateFactory\r\n  )\r\n  {\r\n    final ColumnCapabilities capabilities = columnSelectorFactory.getColumnCapabilities(columnName);\r\n\r\n    // This should be folded into the ValueMatcherColumnSelectorStrategy once that can handle LONG typed columns.\r\n    if (capabilities != null && capabilities.getType() == ValueType.LONG) {\r\n      return getLongPredicateMatcher(\r\n          columnSelectorFactory.makeColumnValueSelector(columnName),\r\n          predicateFactory.makeLongPredicate()\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    final ColumnSelectorPlus<ValueMatcherColumnSelectorStrategy> selector =\r\n        DimensionHandlerUtils.createColumnSelectorPlus(\r\n            ValueMatcherColumnSelectorStrategyFactory.instance(),\r\n            DefaultDimensionSpec.of(columnName),\r\n            columnSelectorFactory\r\n        );\r\n\r\n    return selector.getColumnSelectorStrategy().makeValueMatcher(selector.getSelector(), predicateFactory);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test Filter adds a row to the IncrementalIndex in the test when the predicateFactory creates a new String predicate, after `DimensionHandlerUtils.createColumnSelectorPlus` is called.\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-18T00:48:22Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T00:08:25Z","closed_at":"2018-09-18T06:43:30Z","merged_at":"2018-09-18T06:43:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"609da018827697b7ae5ce6cc464762041e9a865e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

I printed jstack of my overlord node, then I found there was a KIS supervisor thread which should have been shutdown long ago:\r\n```\r\n\"KafkaSupervisor-aweme\" #232 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0

`KafkaSupervisor#stop` being called, [`exec#shutdownNow`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/dabaf4caf8f1a5b62df27bdc7b777c68bde10bc3/extensions-core/kafka-indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/kafka/supervisor/KafkaSupervisor.java#L477) will be called which will make a interrupt for the thread. Then, this interrupt will cause the thread to terminate. But it seems not work sometimes. Here is a quote of `ExecutorService#shutdownNow` from javadoc:\r\n```\r\nThere are no guarantees beyond best-effort attempts to stop processing \r\nactively executing tasks.  For example, typical implementations will cancel \r\nvia {@link Thread#interrupt}, so any task that fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate.\r\n```\r\nIt seems the KIS notice handle task fails to respond to interrupts? So I submit this PR which may help fix this issue.","created_at":"2018-09-17T15:43:54Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T17:07:37Z","closed_at":"2018-09-27T03:09:54Z","merged_at":"2018-09-27T03:09:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"993bc5e9d3e46f07139b00270875824e8980f963","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563043,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Streaming%20Ingestion","name":"Area

another PR, after re-basing on top of the new state of the Druid master. The comments added in PR#6235 will be all fixed. Adding here the previous introduction...\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nHi Everybody,\r\n\r\nPlease take a look on the following Oak Incremental Index Pool Request. Below please find a list of the help material. Although we will soon present also the performance results, we would like to hear your thoughts and comments from the correctness and software engineering point of views.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnastasia\r\n\r\nIn continuation to our great talk yesterday (where we agreed about publishing a PR for Oak Incremental Index for Druid), hereby please find some reading material about Oak. The pool request itself will be ready for tomorrow. I would strongly suggest to read some of the documentation prior to looking on the code, as it may make the last task easier and clearer. As I said the Oak is now an open source library (https://github.com/yahoo/Oak) and its README might help you to understand the Oak's interface and new Druid's code.\r\n\r\nRecall we had an issue#5698 about Oak Incremental Index (#5698) and there you can find another useful documents to start from. We will publish the latest single-thread ingestion benchmark results tomorrow, together with the pool request. Feel free to ask questions!\r\n\r\nFiles from the issue:\r\n\r\n    1.  Oak Introduction: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/files/1946175/OakIntroduction.pdf\r\n    2.  Oak Details Presentation: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/files/1946182/OAK.Off-Heap.Allocated.Keys.pptx\r\n    3.

described here](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/rerun-failing-tests.html), lets see if this can help out at all.\r\n\r\nMy gut tells me that this is not a good idea to do in practice, but false failure rate due to known flaky tests seems pretty bad lately. It could be potentially scoped to `druid-api`, `druid-common`, `druid-processing`, `druid-server`, `druid-indexing-service`, `druid-kafka-indexing-service` to cover all currently open issues with the flaky-test label. \r\n\r\nI'd much prefer if we could just set an annotation on the actual tests that we know to be lame and only allow this functionality on those, but I haven't turned up anything that does that yet. Idealistically we fix them all, but on the other hand some of these have been failing on occasion for years now, that I know myself and many other have spent a fair chunk of time trying to resolve to no avail. Many of these tests are covering rather complicated behaviors and interactions, so are generally worth putting up with flaky behavior for the value they provide, so disabling them isn't an option either.\r\n\r\nI would say on the upside, this option will hopefully result in less time spent re-triggering the same (mostly `curator-test` based) tests over and over until they pass. An obvious downside is lower chance of once and for all resolving flaky tests since catching new ones requires checking the test results manually and that it's easier to ignore existing issues if they don't explode on you often.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this might not help at all, since retries might push us over the timeout limit. I suggest we re-run the tests on this PR many times to check if it's effective at all. [Also, this option is only for junit 4.x](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1558), just to add to the pile of things to consider.","created_at":"2018-09-10T19:48:00Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T00:02:51Z","closed_at":"2018-09-12T02:17:00Z","merged_at":"2018-09-12T02:17:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"96a1076e238910e680669d4f7ff91186cfd6ae45","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

had to include the Sigar repo otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe server-metrics code is now embedded in Druid's own java-util module though, and that's not positioned as a general use library for other projects, so I think that concern is less relevant now.\r\n\r\nSigar is Apache licensed too, so that's good:

I did for this:\r\n\r\n1. Move all directories containing `io/druid` into directories containing `org/apache/druid`.\r\n2. Replace all strings `druid-io/druid` with `apache/incubator-druid` (intended to update the Github repo links).\r\n3. Replace all strings `io.druid` with `org.apache.druid`.\r\n4. Replace all strings `io/druid` with `org/apache/druid`.\r\n5. Change some back: io.druid still must be the groupId for the parent pom, and io.druid is still the groupId for druid-console (we should reconcile these both later).\r\n6. Move all META-INF io.druid.initialization.DruidModule files to org.apache.druid.initialization.DruidModule.\r\n7. Remove some apparently unintentionally committed files: processing/benchmarks/io.druid.collections.bitmap.RangeBitmapBenchmarkTest.html, processing/benchmarks/io.druid.collections.bitmap.RangeBitmapBenchmarkTest.jsonp, processing/benchmarks/io.druid.collections.bitmap.UniformBitmapBenchmarkTest.html, and processing/benchmarks/io.druid.collections.bitmap.UniformBitmapBenchmarkTest.jsonp, from #5275.\r\n8. Update the monitors migration code from the MonitorsConfig class to automatically migrate `com.metamx.metrics` and `io.druid.java.util.metrics` to `org.apache.druid.java.util.metrics`.\r\n9. Reorder some dimensions in inner queries in CalciteQueryTest for some reason (?). The planner possibly travels down different internal paths based on package names in, perhaps, toString operators? I'm not sure.\r\n10. Updated `prototest.desc` in the protobuf test package by running `protoc ProtoTest.proto -o prototest.desc`.","created_at":"2018-08-29T23:07:17Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T17:57:15Z","closed_at":"2018-08-30T16:56:27Z","merged_at":"2018-08-30T16:56:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"431d3d8497f9079857c3baa7ae7ab4cb44a22355","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283617667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM2MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Incompatible","name":"Incompatible","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release
