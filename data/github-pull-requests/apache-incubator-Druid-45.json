Description\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up of #12486 \r\n\r\n#12486 removes the web-console dependency from druid-server module because the dependency check reports that it's not used in druid-server module.\r\n\r\nBecause druid-server module is referenced by many other modules, the existence of web-console dependency in druid-server module makes that module to be compiled after the web-console module. However, building of web-console module usually takes a long time. If the whole module is built in parallel with `-T` mvn parameter, this dependency makes the building slower.\r\n\r\nAfter #12486 is merged, @vogievetsky found that this dependency must be there or the web-console module won't be shipped in the distribution package(https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12486#discussion_r863492827)\r\n\r\nThe druid distribution package is packaged by the `mvn-assembly-plugin` referenced in the `druid-distribution` module. \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/0206a2da5c6211caf451751876d847f40c2e7755/distribution/pom.xml#L256-L258\r\n\r\nThis plugin is also configured to copy all dependencies declared in the pom of `druid-distribution` to the `lib` directory as below.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/0206a2da5c6211caf451751876d847f40c2e7755/distribution/src/assembly/assembly.xml#L126-L129\r\n\r\nSo, we can move the dependency declaration from the druid-server module to the druid-distribution module so that we still gain the  building speed up as well as the package integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid

native batch ingestion job can be in either of these three modes: `REPLACE` (new since tombstones were added), `APPEND`, and `REPLACE_LEGACY` (current default for native batch ingestion). These modes are set with appropriate values for the following `IOConfig` flags: `appendToExisting` and `dropExisting`.  The goal of this ticket is to emit Druid metrics to be able to assess the utilization of the different flavors of batch ingestion, in particular replace & tombstone creation.\r\n\r\nCopying from the `metrics.md` documentation:\r\n|Metric|Description|Dimensions|Normal Value|\r\n|------|-----------|----------|------------|\r\n|`ingest/count`|Count of `1` every time an ingestion job runs (includes compaction jobs). Aggregate using dimensions. |dataSource, taskId, taskType, taskIngestionMode|Always `1`.|\r\n|`ingest/segments/count`|Count of final segments created by job (includes tombstones). |dataSource, taskId, taskType, taskIngestionMode|At least `1`.|\r\n|`ingest/tombstones/count`|Count of tombstones created by job |dataSource, taskId, taskType, taskIngestionMode|Zero or more for replace. Always zero for non-replace tasks (always zero for legacy replace, see below).|\r\n\r\nThe `taskIngestionMode` dimension includes the following modes: \r\n`APPEND`, `REPLACE_LEGACY`, and `REPLACE`. The `APPEND` mode indicates a native\r\ningestion job that is appending to existing segments; `REPLACE` a native ingestion\r\njob replacing existing segments using tombstones; \r\nand `REPLACE_LEGACY` the original replace before tombstones.\r\n\r\nThe mode is decided using the values\r\nof the `isAppendToExisting` and `isDropExisting` flags in the\r\ntask's `IOConfig` as follows:\r\n\r\n|`isAppendToExisting` | `isDropExisting` | mode |\r\n|---------------------|-------------------|------|\r\n`true` | `false` | `APPEND`|\r\n`true` | `true  ` | Invalid combination, exception thrown. |\r\n`false` | `false` | `REPLACE_LEGACY` (this is the default for native batch ingestion). |\r\n`false` | `true` | `REPLACE`|\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

However, not all call sites\r\nrespected this, so this patch also updates those call sites.\r\n\r\nOne particularly sneaky way that the old code retained entries too long\r\nis due to Guava's MergingIterator and CombiningIterator. Internally,\r\nthese both advance to the next value prior to returning the current\r\nvalue. So, this patch addresses that in two ways:\r\n\r\n1) For merging, we have our own implementation MergeIterator already,\r\n   although it had the same problem. So, this patch updates our\r\n   implementation to return the current item prior to advancing to the\r\n   next item. It also adds a forbidden-api entry to ensure that this\r\n   safer implementation is used instead of Guava's.\r\n\r\n2) For combining, we address the problem in a different way: by copying\r\n   the key when creating the new, combined entry.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-22T17:16:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:12:56Z","closed_at":"2022-04-29T06:21:13Z","merged_at":"2022-04-29T06:21:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"529b983ad0ad8ee5b5cdcdfe81fe840fc3bd0427","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Description\r\n\r\nEnable usage of multiple base task directories for task data using List<StorageTaskLocation> instead of a single File.\r\n\r\nThe current change uses uniformly random assignment based on taskId to one of the locations.\r\n\r\nTODO: Distribute tasks to Locations with count proportional to their maxSize.\r\nTODO: Add tests to validate the behaviour with multiple disks\r\nTODO: Documentation changes\r\n\r\nQuestion: When the task directories change, is it necessary to ensure that restored tasks belong to the same disk they were restored from after being restored?\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nNOTE: Enforcement of task data to Location maxSize limits has not been implemented\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

patch attacks two sources of allocations during Jackson\r\nserialization:\r\n\r\n1) ObjectMapper.writeValue and JsonGenerator.writeObject create a new\r\n   DefaultSerializerProvider instance for each call. It has lots of\r\n   fields and creates pressure on the garbage collector. So, this patch\r\n   adds helper functions in JacksonUtils that enable reuse of\r\n   SerializerProvider objects and updates various call sites to make\r\n   use of this.\r\n\r\n2) GroupByQueryToolChest copies the ObjectMapper for every query to\r\n   install a special module that supports backwards compatibility with\r\n   map-based rows. This isn't needed if resultAsArray is set and\r\n   all servers are running Druid 0.16.0 or later. This release was a\r\n   while ago. So, this patch disables backwards compatibility by default,\r\n   which eliminates the need to copy the heavyweight ObjectMapper. The\r\n   patch also introduces a configuration option that allows admins to\r\n   explicitly enable backwards compatibility.","created_at":"2022-04-21T19:48:24Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:13:01Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T21:17:26Z","merged_at":"2022-04-27T21:17:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"a2bad0b3a2c80a5ffb704ec8c4a0e18734455d38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release Notes","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSuppressing this CVE since we are only using hadoop client.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nMove the stats-d emitter to a core extension. \r\n\r\nAFAICT we are using the latest version of the java client https://github.com/DataDog/java-dogstatsd-client/releases/tag/v4.0.0\r\n\r\nI have tried running this extension in a cluster and haven't noticed any issues. I did notice that not all metrics are reported in the default configuration. I've added 2 more metrics to be reported by default `coordinator/global/time` and `coordinator/time` as these are helpful in knowing how long different coordinator duties are taking.\r\n\r\nI had considered a system to automatically detect when a new metric was reported so that we don't forget to update the config of this emitter when a new metric is added, however, I could not think of a reliable way to do this, so I decided to leave it out of the change that promotes this extension to a core extension.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThe SchemaStatsMonitor reports detailed metrics for each segment in the cluster.\r\n\r\nA user will need to enable this since I am not yet certain what the impact will\r\nbe if this operation happens on large clusters.\r\n\r\nThe metric naming scheme of segment/detailed/* is because there are already\r\nmetrics named segment/* which have a similar use, but are reported differently.\r\n\r\nI had considered reporting the number of rows per segment via the\r\nEmitClusterStatsAndMetricsModule since we have access to the DataSegment object\r\nin the coordinator when running through the details to decide which segments\r\nneed compaction. This proved challenging since the number of rows wasn't\r\nreadily available.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR is still missing unit tests, but I was hoping to get an initial round of feedback before I go too far down this path.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nEnable ARM builds\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nHi, Tom from Codecov here. I noticed that you were using Codecov but weren't actually getting any notifications on pull requests. I figured it would be useful to get some idea if code being changed is being tested, but also not blocking CI/merging. Let me know if this makes sense or if we can do something that would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

bug in auto compaction preserveExistingMetrics feature\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following changes:\r\n- Auto compaction should not set preserveExistingMetrics if metricsSpec is not explicitly set in auto compaction config. This falls back to current behavior before metricsSpec was added to auto compaction and Compaction task would be able to automatically discover and generate the correct combining metricsSpec without needing to use preserveExistingMetrics function\r\n- When preserveExistingMetrics is use, some Aggregators may return different Type in it's Combine method. For example, the FloatSum takes in two Float but returns a Double in its Combine method. This PR handle this case by converting the returned Object to a Number object then calling the Number Object's method to get the correct Type value.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThe Travis CI cron job flagged https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43138. This failure is a false alarm as the CVE is about the Async javascript library (https://github.com/caolan/async), not `async-http-client-netty-utils`. Even though we do use the Async library for the web console development, I think we can still suppress this CVE as the Async library is a [dev dependency](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/web-console/package-lock.json#L6394-L6402).\r\n\r\nThis PR also cleans up a stale suppression for netty-3.10.5.Final which we no longer use.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nFixes some errors in NOTES.txt when installing or upgrading with a `LoadBalancer` service.\r\n1. Add the namespace arg in two commands where it was missing\r\n2. Append `-router` to the end of the \"fullnames\".  For example, with a basic install/upgrade, `kubectl get svc --namespace dev -w druid` fails but `kubectl get svc --namespace dev -w druid-router` works as intended.\r\n3. Corrects the jsonpath search by changing `ip` to `hostname`.\r\n\r\nGiven a basic installation that does not change the configuration too much, and assuming that the service changed to a `LoadBalancer` is the router, the commands in this section of the notes now work as intended.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes a regression caused by #11853 when processing boolean typed inputs for transformation expressions at ingestion time, such as from JSON and other input formats which support them. The changes to how expression types were resolved to make room for `COMPLEX`, resulted in expression input that is of the `Boolean` java type ending up as `COMPLEX` druid type. Now, if these values will be correctly converted to either `STRING` or `LONG` druid types, if `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans=true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

Description\r\n\r\n`includeAllDimensions` was added recently in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12276. When `useFieldDiscovery` and `includeAllDimensions` are both set, `IndexMerger` should store every column even if it is empty. However, it currently doesn't respect the `includeAllDimensions` flag but only checks if the given column is explicitly specified in the dimensionsSpec. This PR fixes this bug by checking the flag properly.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes another bug in `JsonInputFormat` that implicitly filters null fields out even when `useFieldDiscovery` is set. Instead of filtering them out in an early stage in ingestion, `keepNullColumns` will be set automatically if `useFieldDiscovery` is set, so that `MapInputRowParser` can check the dimensionsSpec to decide whether to keep the null fields or not. This change will not make any user-facing change as 1) `keepNullColumns` is undocumented and used only in the sampler and 2) even if there is someone using `keepNullColumns`, the existing behavior should remain the same. The behavior changes only when `includeAllDimensions` is set as well as `useFieldDiscovery`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `IndexMergerV9`\r\n * `JsonInputFormat`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Goal\r\n\r\n- Make the current caching cost function in `SegmentsCostCache` equivalent to the default cost strategy for all segments - across the cache.\r\n- Improve the performance of the currently existing caching cost strategy.\r\n- Fix bugs / optimize `CachingCostBalancerStrategy`\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### TLDR;\r\n\r\nThe current default cost strategy requires a summation across all segments each time and can be slow to compute costs.\r\n\r\n`SegmentsCostCache` aimed to make it faster using the idea of buckets but was not identical.\r\nIt has now been made equivalent to the above strategy as part of this PR, and is significantly faster than the orignal cost.\r\n\r\n`SegmentsCostCacheV3` is a new implementation introduced in this PR which is several times faster. \r\n\r\nTime to insert 100k random segments across multiple buckets and build cache:\r\nSegmentsCostCache :      `39807 milliseconds`  ->   O(N ^ 2)\r\nSegmentsCostCacheV3 :      `189 milliseconds`  ->   O(NlogN)\r\n\r\nThe complexity for default cost computation is O(N)\r\nCaching cost improves it by a constant factor determined by the segment interval distribution.\r\nThe new caching cost reduces the complexity from O(N) to O(logN) for computeCost operations.\r\nTime to compute joint cost across all (100k) segments (averaged over 1k runs):\r\nDefault strategy:               `28757 microseconds`  ->   O (N)\r\nSegmentsCostCache:        `8728 microseconds`  ->   O(N) / pruning constant\r\nSegmentsCostCacheV3:        `13 microseconds`  ->   O(logN)\r\n\r\nFor a cluster with a large number of segments, the bottleneck was computing cost across all segments present.\r\n\r\nThe time to compute this now is insignificant, and the new bottleneck is computing the cost across all segments in a load / drop state\r\n\r\n`NOTE`:\r\n\r\nThe performance the overall CachingCostBalancerStrategy is unlikely to be as much faster as these numbers reflect.\r\n\r\nThis is because we still need to fetch and compute the cost across all segments to be loaded and dropped as well.\r\n\r\nIf there are N segments in total and M segments in load / drop state for a given server:\r\n- The overall complexity for default strategy is `O(N)`\r\n- The overall complexity for `CachingCostBalancerStrategy` is `O(logN + M ^ 2)`. It also currently has a few inaccuracies.\r\n- The current PR brings the complexity down to `O(logN + M)` by fixing the existing bugs / redundancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/2972 proposes a cost function for Segment balancing.\r\n\r\nThe pairwise cost function of two segments decreases with an increase in their intervals' \"distance\".\r\n\r\nThe overall cost for a target segment is the sum of its pairwise cost across all segments present.\r\n\r\nThe idea of computing using buckets was introduced in `SegmentsCostCache`.\r\n\r\nSubsets of segments are stored in \"buckets\" around a specified interval to to avoid unnecessary computations with negligible contribution as distance between segments increases.\r\n\r\nBuckets also store certain precomputed sums to reduce calculations when segments are added or removed. \r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### Make SegmentsCostCache's cost function identical to original function (DONE)\r\n\r\nThe cost returned by SegmentsCostCache was \"almost\" proportional to CostBalancerStrategy.\r\n\r\nConsider segment set with intervals: { [1, 10], [3, 5] }\r\nIf we were to try to compute the cost wrt a segment with interval [7, 15], the previous code would have computed the cost for the pair ([1, 10], [7, 15]) incorrectly. \r\nThis is because once a value on its left doesn't overlap, all the elements further before are assumed to not overlap either, which is incorrect. (when segments of various interval lengths are present)\r\nThis has been rectified.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the costs computed differ by a constant multiplication factor of [(24 / ln(2)) ^ 2] or ~ 1198.868\r\nThis can be proven :)\r\nIt's easy to use the same units for half life and other constants in both classes and compare the cost computation side by side to see that they are proportional.\r\n\r\nTests have been added to verify the equivalence.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### Fix CachingCostBalancerStrategy (TODO)\r\n\r\nThe overall cost  = cost across all segments + cost across segments to be loaded - cost across segments to be dropped\r\n\r\n- The method `computeCost` doesn't subtract the cost across dropping segments, and this needs to be fixed.\r\n- To compute the cost across all loading segments, the current implementation builds a cache with O(M^2). Simply summing over the parwise cost function across all the segments will optimize it to O(M).\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## New approach (DONE)\r\n\r\nOld caching code:\r\n\r\nThe cost corresponding to a target segment with all the segments in a bucket can be computed by iterating the set of segments whose intervals overlap with it, and computing the sum of their pairwise costs. Iterating through the list of overlapping intervals is still O(N), even if less by a constant factor.\r\n\r\nNew caching code: (See `SegmentsCostCacheV3`)\r\n\r\nWe still utilize the idea of buckets but use a few mathematical properties to make cost computation faster\r\n\r\nThe cost function is of the form: \r\n<img width=\"209\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95239065/163671514-32cd1359-58e5-46e5-b118-5c8134e19dbf.png\">\r\n\r\nWhere <x1, x2> is the interval of the segment in the bucket, and <y1, y2> is the interval of the segment whose cost is being computed.\r\n\r\nThe integral from {x1 -> x2} can be computed as {x1 -> end } - {x2 -> end} as follows:\r\n<img width=\"441\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95239065/163671624-f3e6cb25-988d-42d0-95b7-ac9beac6a0b2.png\">\r\n\r\nWhere end is the bucket's interval's end. This property facilitates us to expand and group the summation of the function across a bucket in a manner which can utilize prefix sums of the natural exponents for the overall function.\r\n\r\nEach of the six cases for alignment of <x, end>, <y1, y2> has a different reduced form for the integral and the sum over all these cases gives the overall cost.\r\n\r\nBoth segment addition / removal become an O(1) operation.\r\nBucket building remains to be O(NlogN) due to sorting\r\nCost computation over a bucket of size N becomes an O(logN) operation\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nThe purpose of bucketing for the new approach is different from that for the old caching one.\r\n\r\nThe old approach had a slow update time when segments were added / removed to a bucket, and an appropriate size for buckets was a required tradeoff.\r\n\r\nThe new approach has a negligible update time, and could have ideally stored all segments in a single bucket.\r\nHowever, the end of the bucket's reference interval plays a key role in calculation, and a high value can lead to double overflows.\r\nSo, we still need to bucket intervals by time. However, we are now allowed to use a higher value (provided there is no overflow) than before, and that improves the overall cost computation time even further\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n### Scope for future work\r\n\r\nSince the number of loading / unloading segments (M) can be high at times, the cost complexity O(M + logN) is not ideal.\r\nThe current CachingCostStrategy can only compute cost after building which is a costly operation of O(NlogN).\r\n\r\n1) Introduce new APIs that return only the difference set of loading / dropping segments after a CachingCostStrategy has been initialized.\r\n\r\n2)  A new implementation which supports cost computation without an offline build would utilize the above APIs and compute the cost. \r\n(Achievable with a Treap with lazy propogation which supports O(logN) insert / remove / range update / range queries)\r\n\r\nThe above changes would mean that the first cost computation is O(M). Subsequent cost computations would only be O(logN + logM).\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

query \r\n`select __time as t, val from table group by 1,2 order by 1` fails to plan.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that this query during the explain phase translates into a scan query which uses the alias `t` but the check in the scan query allows group by only on the `__time` column. This causes a mismatch as the planner cannot understand that `t` and `__time` means the same thing.\r\n\r\nThis is solved by the rowtype being set from the output type of the subquery in such a case. There is a fallback for the other cases. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

I checked and found that the most time is spended on calling DimensionRangeShardSpec.isInChunk to lookup target shard, as there are about 6000 shards.  Using binary search instead of comparing the row to every shardSpec to decide its shard  obviously improve this, the mapper cost only 30 minutes now!\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nFor a query like \r\n`INSERT INTO tablename SELECT channel, added as count FROM wikipedia` the error message is `Encountered \"as count\"`. However, for the insert statement\r\n `INSERT INTO t\r\nSELECT\r\n  channel,\r\n  added as count\r\nFROM wikipedia\r\nPARTITIONED BY ALL`\r\nreturns `INSERT statements must specify PARTITIONED BY clause explictly` (incorrectly). This PR corrects this.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n- Add EOF to end of Druid SQL Insert statements\r\n- Rename SQL Insert statements in the parser to reflect the behaviour change\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

web-console (indirectly) calls the Overlord’s GET tasks API to fetch the tasks' summary which in turn queries the metadata tasks table. This query tries to fetch several columns, including payload, of all the rows at once. This introduces a significant memory overhead and can cause unresponsiveness or overlord failure when the ingestion tab is opened multiple times (due to several parallel calls to this API)\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that the task table (the payload column in particular) can be very large. Extracting large payloads from such tables can be very slow, leading to slow UI. While we are fixing the memory pressure in the overlord, we can also fix the slowness in UI caused by fetching large payloads from the table. Fetching large payloads also puts pressure on the metadata store as reported in the community ([Metadata store query performance degrades as the tasks in druid_tasks table grows · Issue #12318 · apache/druid](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12318) )\r\n\r\nThe task summaries returned as a response for the API are several times smaller and can fit comfortably in memory. So, there is an opportunity here to fix the memory usage, slow ingestion, and under-pressure metadata store by removing the need to handle large payloads in every layer we can. Of course, the solution becomes complex as we try to fix more layers. With that in mind, this page captures two approaches. They vary in complexity and also in the degree to which they fix the aforementioned problems. \r\n\r\nApproach 1:\r\nA simple solution that mitigates the memory usage is to use streaming SQL queries and process the payload blob immediately to extract the necessary fields. This removes the current logic in the overlord that buffers the heavy payloads in memory. So at any point in time, you only keep the minimum required data in overlord memory. \r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\nMitigates the memory usage problem without “complex” changes.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\nThe SQL calls, and the processing overhead to deserialize the payload remain the same as before.\r\n\r\nWhile this mitigates the memory problem, it can still be unresponsive when there are several tasks that need to be fetched in parallel.\r\n\r\nIt also doesn’t help with the overhead seen on the metadata store side. \r\n\r\nFinal approach:\r\nThis approach proposes adding two new columns without modifying the rest of the columns' data, to the MySQL table. These fields are task type and task group id. We only need these two fields in the API result and we currently extract them from the payload blob. Since we are fetching the minimal required data, the calls to the metadata store will be faster and reduce the network throughput as well. \r\n\r\nSince this approach involves a schema change for existing clusters, we need to migrate the task history that is already stored at the time of upgrade. We also need to ensure that the new tasks use these columns to store task type and group id. And of course, the new query for this API utilizes these fields instead of the payload column.\r\n\r\nLocal testing confirms that it is significantly more responsive when there are multiple concurrent calls to a sizeable task set.\r\n\r\nPlease find the detailed changes below\r\n\r\nSchema changes \r\nAlter the table to add the two new columns in the schema if not already present. This alteration will be executed from the java code. It is assumed that the druid services have permission to execute DDL instructions in the database. \r\n\r\nTask history migration \r\nAfter the schema changes are done, we need to migrate the task history. These two steps will be done in sequence. \r\n\r\nMigration can be done in a separate thread, kicked off at startup. This thread will continue to check for completed tasks in a loop till all the complete tasks have been migrated. \r\n\r\n- fetch  completed task rows with a limit (say 100)\r\n\r\n- parse the payload to obtain type, groupId\r\n\r\n- update the group id and task type in the rows corresponding to these tasks\r\n\r\n- Repeat\r\n\r\nWe need to ensure that we do not repeat this process for new tasks that are already populating the new fields. We also need to ensure that already migrated tasks are not visited again.\r\n\r\nTask peristence\r\nAny new task must now persist the new columns to the table\r\n\r\nTask history query\r\nThe new mysql query ignores the payload, and has a much smaller footprint. Instead of passing the entire Task in the TaskInfo wrapper, we now pass a map of strings with keys corresponding to the new columns, which are utilized by the parsing utility in OverlordResource. While the migration is ongoing, we will utilize the query of Approach 1 to avoid memory issues, and still populate the columns.

while loading a lookup for the first time, loading threads blocks for `waitForFirstRunMs` incase the lookup failed to load. If the `waitForFirstRunMs` is a decent amount of time (like 10 minutes), such blocking can slow down the loading of other lookups.

Description\r\n\r\nThe query context is a way that the user gives a hint to the Druid query engine, so that they enforce a certain behavior or at least let the query engine prefer a certain plan during query planning. Today, there are 3 types of query context params as below.\r\n\r\n- Default context params. They are set via `druid.query.default.context` in runtime properties. Any user context params can be default params.\r\n- User context params. They are set in the user query request. See https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/query-context.html for parameters.\r\n- System context params. They are set by the Druid query engine during query processing. These params override other context params.\r\n\r\nToday, any context params are allowed to users. This can cause 1) a bad UX if the context param is not matured yet or 2) even query failure or system fault in the worst case if a sensitive param is abused, ex) `maxSubqueryRows`. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds an ability to limit context params per user role. That means, a query will fail if you have a context param set in the query that is not allowed to you. To do that, this PR adds a new built-in resource type, `QUERY_CONTEXT`. The resource to authorize has a name of the context param (such as `maxSubqueryRows`) and the type of `QUERY_CONTEXT`. To allow a certain context param for a user, the user should be granted `WRITE` permission on the context param resource. Here is an example of the permission.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"resourceAction\" : {\r\n    \"resource\" : {\r\n      \"name\" : \"maxSubqueryRows\",\r\n      \"type\" : \"QUERY_CONTEXT\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"action\" : \"WRITE\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"resourceNamePattern\" : \"maxSubqueryRows\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach role can have multiple permissions for context params. Each permission should be set for different context params.\r\n\r\nWhen a query is issued with a query context `X`, the query will fail if the user who issued the query does not have WRITE permission on the query context `X`. In this case,\r\n\r\n- HTTP endpoints will return 403 response code.\r\n- JDBC will throw ForbiddenException.\r\n\r\nNote: there is a context param called `brokerService` that is used only by the router. This param is used to pin your query to run it in a specific broker. Because the authorization is done not in the router, but in the broker, if you have `brokerService` set in your query without a proper permission, your query will fail in the broker after routing is done. Technically, this is not right because the authorization is checked after the context param takes effect. However, this should not cause any user-facing issue and thus should be OK. The query will still fail if the user doesn’t have permission for `brokerService`.\r\n\r\nThe context param authorization can be enabled using `druid.auth.authorizeQueryContextParams`. This is disabled by default to avoid any hassle when someone upgrades his cluster blindly without reading release notes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `QueryContext` tracks user params and separates them from others.\r\n * `QueryHolder` has a state indicating whether the context in the native query is valid.\r\n * `QueryLifecycle` retrieves context params from a valid source.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-04T22:18:11Z","updated_at":"2022-05-25T00:17:56Z","closed_at":"2022-04-21T08:51:16Z","merged_at":"2022-04-21T08:51:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"73ce5df22dc64a675be2ec5e6b86b1b6ad211808","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nAfter tombstones were introduced compaction was made to work by having tombstones being skipped when they were read by the compaction task. This made compaction less intuitive for datasources with tombstones and also had an issue that reingesting a data source made only from tombstones made ingestion fail. In particular, auto-compaction in the coordinator would fail for a data source that contained only tombstones for the compaction interval chosen by the auto-compaction policy. This PR no longer skips tombstones fixing these issues.\r\n\r\nWith this change, if you ask Druid to ingest (or compact) a datasource interval that only contains tombstones the ingestion will work as follows. If the flag `dropExisting` is set to `true` then new tombstones will be created according to the provided segment granularity. If the flag is set to `false` then no new tombstones will be created.\r\n\r\nThis change does not require any special upgrade or downgrade steps since it is functionally equivalent to the version before this change.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n Class `org.apache.druid.indexing.common.task.CompactionTask` was previously skipping data segments for tombstones.\r\nNow it processes tombstones as other data segments that contain data, but creating an empty iterator for their data source since tombstones contain no data. It also avoids loading a `QueryableIndex` for them since they are not pushed to deep storage during ingestion. This processing is more aligned with how segments are compacted and ingested.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFollowing up on #12315, which pushed most of the logic of building `ImmutableBitmap` into `BitmapIndex` in order to hide the details of how column indexes are implemented from the `Filter` implementations, this PR totally refashions how `Filter` consume indexes. The end result, while a rather dramatic reshuffling of the existing code, should be extraordinarily flexible, eventually allowing us to model any type of index we can imagine, and providing the machinery to build the filters that use them, while also allowing for other column implementations to implement the built-in index types to provide adapters to make use indexing in the current set filters that Druid provides.\r\n\r\n#### Index changes\r\n\r\n`BitmapIndex` has been split into 4 concrete implementations, `DictionaryEncodedStringValueIndex`, `StringValueSetIndex`, `LexicographicalRangeIndex`, and `DruidPredicateIndex`.\r\n\r\n##### `DictionaryEncodedStringValueIndex` and `BitmapColumnIndex`\r\n`DictionaryEncodedStringValueIndex` is identical to `BitmapIndex` prior to #12315, and is a 'leaky' abstraction that is very much tied to how string dictionary encoded columns store a lexicographical sorted value dictionary, and also a lexicographical sorted index dictionary for the index on those values. `Filter` implementations no longer use this index directly, since it requires knowing a bunch of implementation details which filtering need not concern themselves with. Instead, the other 3 implementations produce a new thing\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface BitmapColumnIndex\r\n{\r\n  ColumnIndexCapabilities getIndexCapabilities();\r\n\r\n  <T> T computeBitmapResult(BitmapResultFactory<T> bitmapResultFactory);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich captures some information about that index, and can be computed into a `T` with the `BitmapResultFactory` (e.g. into a `ImmutableBitmap` representing the rows selected by that filter to use with a `BitmapOffset`). A promise of a bitmap, and information about it for that filter against those inputs, if you will.\r\n\r\n##### `StringValueSetIndex`\r\n`StringValueSetIndex` is the index implementation that the majority of our current filters which support indexes use, and provides facilities for getting`BitmapColumnIndex` for a single string value to match, a set of string values.\r\n\r\n##### `LexicographicalRangeIndex`\r\n`LexicographicalRangeIndex` captures the pattern of the optimization which can be done for bound and like filters in certain cases, where taking advantage of the fact that the indexes are stored in lexicographical order for string dimensions, a `ImmutableBitmap` can be produced by gathering all indexes within the start and end dictionary id of the underlying values and unioning them.\r\n\r\n##### `DruidPredicateIndex`\r\n`DruidPredicateIndex` is an index which can be constructed using a `DruidPredicateFactory`, which for dictionary encoded string columns means the string predicate is used and evaluated against all of the values which are present in the value dictionary.\r\n\r\n##### `ColumnIndexSelector` and `ColumnIndexSupplier`\r\nThe methods by which `Filter` obtain these indexes from columns has also been heavily reworked. `BitmapIndexSelector` is now called `ColumnIndexSelector`, and the focus here is a new method:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Nullable\r\n  ColumnIndexSupplier getIndexSupplier(String column);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich `Filter` implementations can call into to get an index supplier for the column they are interested in using indexes.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface ColumnIndexSupplier\r\n{\r\n  @Nullable\r\n  <T> T as(Class<T> clazz);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAll columns which \"exist\" will have a non-null `ColumnIndexSupplier`, so `Filter` implementations can use a null response here to check if the filter matches the null value, and produce an all true or all false index instead.\r\n\r\n`ColumnHolder` has also been modified to instead of having a `Supplier<BitmapIndex>` and `Supplier<SpatialIndex>` to use `ColumnIndexSupplier`. `VirtualColumn` also contains a method to fetch a `ColumnIndexSupplier`, with additional access to a `ColumnSelector` so they can potentially read stuff from an underlying segment when constructing it. \r\n\r\nThis lets the implementation of `ColumnIndexSelector`, `ColumnSelectorColumnIndexSelector` (formerly known as `ColumnSelectorBitmapIndexSelector`), pass through the either the virtual or physical column index supplier, or null if the column is missing entirely. \r\n\r\nFor dictionary encoded string columns, the `DictionaryEncodedStringIndexSupplier.getIndex` method can supply implementations of `DictionaryEncodedStringValueIndex`, `StringValueSetIndex`, `LexicographicalRangeIndex`, `DruidPredicateIndex` and, through the same interface, `SpatialIndex`, without any specific methods to fetch any of these implementations.\r\n\r\n##### `ColumnIndexCapabilities`\r\nThe vast majority of the changes in this PR are simply re-arranging existing pieces. There is one exception to this however, which is the previously mentioned `ColumnIndexCapabilities` type. I've preemptively added this type in anticipation of adding additional index types, and gone ahead and wired this up into the filter partitioning logic that currently resides in `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter`.\r\n\r\n`ColumnIndexCapabilities` is sort of an analog to ColumnCapabilities, but for information about a specific conjuring of `BitmapColumnIndex`. I've added two methods here which no current filters actually take advantage of, but that I know will be of use in the near future as we begin to add additional index implementations: 'is exact' and 'is invertible', the former of which captures the pattern of indexes which can be used to reduce the total number of rows scanned, or which may produce false positives and so should still be 'post' filtered with a value matcher, and the latter for index types which might have false positives and so cannot be used in a 'not' filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Filter changes\r\nThe changes to indexes greatly simplify all of the `Filter` implementations. _All `Filter` bitmap index methods have been consolidated into a single method:_\r\n```\r\n  @Nullable\r\n  BitmapColumnIndex getBitmapColumnIndex(ColumnIndexSelector selector);\r\n```\r\nwhich simply if not null, means that the filter has a `BitmapColumnIndex` that can be computed into an offset.\r\n\r\nThis single method replaces:\r\n* `ImmutableBitmap getBitmapIndex(BitmapIndexSelector selector)`\r\n* `<T> T getBitmapResult(BitmapIndexSelector selector, BitmapResultFactory<T> bitmapResultFactory);`\r\n* `boolean supportsBitmapIndex(BitmapIndexSelector selector);`\r\n* `boolean shouldUseBitmapIndex(BitmapIndexSelector selector);`\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n\r\n`ColumnCapabilities` methods `hasBitmapIndexes` and `hasSpatialIndexes` no longer accurately describe columns and should probably be adapted into the set of classes which the `ColumnIndexSupplier` can provide. Likewise, dimension declarations on ingestion specs should eventually also be modified to be more flexible in the types of indexes which can be specified, though I'm not sure yet what this should look like quite yet.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics of how indexes work is still a bit leaky after this change, primarily in that `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter` knows too much about partitioning filters into 'pre' and 'post' filters when building the cursor. I would like to push this into `Filter` itself if possible, potentially getting to where instead of `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter` examining and finding which filters support indexes and collecting the bitmaps from them to create a bitmap offset and using any remaining filters as a post-filtered offset, that instead perhaps the `Filter` itself can create the offset that is used when constructing the cursor. Since `ColumnIndexSupplier` isn't at all opinionated about what types of indexes columns can provide, it opens up the door to creating offsets from information stored in the segment without bitmaps being required.\r\n\r\nHowever, I defer these changes for the future since I've already changed enough here. This does seem like it should be possible though, since the filters already know how to create everything that goes into the current offset construction (`BitmapColumnIndex` and `ValueMatcher`/`VectorValueMatcher`), but would also allow much larger flexibility when constructing the offsets as well as releasing `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter` from having to know anything at all about filters.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `BitmapIndex` -> `DictionaryEncodedStringValueIndex`, `StringValueSetIndex`, `LexicographicalRangeIndex`, `DruidPredicateIndex`\r\n * `BitmapColumnIndex`\r\n * `BitmapIndexSelector` -> `ColumnIndexSelector`\r\n * `ColumnHolder`\r\n * `ColumnIndexSupplier`\r\n * `DictionaryEncodedStringIndexSupplier`\r\n * `QueryableIndexStorageAdapter`\r\n * `ColumnIndexCapabilities`\r\n * `VirtualColumn`\r\n * `Filter` and all implementations\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nRelevant Issue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11929\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n- Add custom replace statement to Druid SQL parser.\r\n- Edit DruidPlanner to convert relevant fields to Query Context.\r\n- Refactor common code with Insert statements to reuse them for replace where possible.\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA dynamic configuration `useListShards` has been added to KinesisSupervisorTuningConfig to control the usage of this API and prevent issues upon upgrade. It can be safely turned on (and is recommended when using kinesis ingestion) by setting this configuration to `true`.\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KinesisRecordSupplier`\r\n * `KinesisAdminClient`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR rebrands `ComplexMetricSerde` as `ComplexTypeSerde`, `ComplexMetrics` as `ComplexTypes`, and `ComplexMetricExtractor` as `ComplexTypeExtractor`. All of the former are marked as deprecated, and their logic moved to (and implement) the latter to minimize disruption. All current serdes still implement `ComplexMetricSerde` rather than the new type, to allow anything using `ComplexMetrics.getSerdeForType` to continue functioning until their future removal, at which point the implementations shall be moved to extend `ComplexTypeSerde` directly.\r\n\r\nI tested that this change is minimally disruptive by doing some tests using extensions (datasketches specifically, for my complex types) built against the master branch without the changes in this PR, and everything was still functioning correctly as far as I can tell, so I think it should be relatively chill despite changing stuff marked `@ExtensionPoint`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid
