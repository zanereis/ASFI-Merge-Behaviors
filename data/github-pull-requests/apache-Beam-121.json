is an intentionally breaking change in the kafka beam SQL table. Currently, using the kafka table provider is impossible with a single reference identifier (LOCATION), and the location field goes entirely unused. This change repurposes the currently unused LOCATION field to be `<single bootstrap broker>/<topic name>`.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change because previously, users could have had LOCATION set to any string they wanted, including those without the <broker>/<topic name> structure, since this field was entirely unused.\r\n\r\nThis change also changes \"bootstrap.servers\" which is a comma-separated string in the properties to \"bootstrap_servers\" which uses a proper array, and makes both the \"topics\" and \"bootstrap_servers\" parameters optional (previously, they were actually required, although the documentation said otherwise).\r\n\r\nAlso update beam documentation to reflect new kafka, pubsub and pubsublite semantics added in this and previous PRs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Update MetricsLogger, so that it does not reset the ProcessWide MetricsContainer.\r\n\r\nThis will clear legitimate process_wide metrics. Instead  have the MetricsLogger calculate the deltas it wishes to log by storing a snapshot of the previously logged metrics.\r\n\r\nThis is needed to enable the BigQueryIO process wide request count metrics.\r\n(Without this change my integration test was flakey, as the metrics were getting cleared during the test)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Add HarnessMonitoringInfosRequest/Response InstructionRequest and MonitoringInfosMetadataRequest/Response support to Java SDK. \r\n\r\n- Adds InstructionRequest handler for HarnessMonitoringInfosRequest/Response (ported from Python SDK) \r\n- Adds start times to each MonitoringInfo recorded (ported from Python SDK)\r\n- Modified ShortIdMap to lookup based on the MonitoringInfoMetricName. We can use this in a follow up PR to further optomize the Java SDK Harness, to only construct each MonitoringInfo (URN+labels) pair once.\r\n- Enables the InstructionRequest in the Environment\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

borrows CalcRelSplitter from Calcite, with a couple modifications:\r\n- \"The latest level should be CalcRelType otherwise literals cannot be\r\nimplemented\"\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/8581f0a3fe9a4f079cb4d36f02121ae22118714c/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/rel/rules/CalcRelSplitter.java#L395-L404\r\nThis restriction seems to be overly specific to Calcite's\r\ninternal usage of CalcRelSplitter. Either Beam RelType can implement\r\nliterals, so it doesn't matter what the latest level is.\r\n- \"Sometimes a level's program merely projects its inputs. We don't want these.\r\nThey cause an explosion in the search space.\"\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/8581f0a3fe9a4f079cb4d36f02121ae22118714c/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/rel/rules/CalcRelSplitter.java#L232-L237\r\nThis check causes failure for queries that don't read from a table. We\r\ncreate a dummy input row in Beam. This results in a BeamZetaSqlCalcRel\r\nbeing created that only reads that dummy input row. This check detects\r\nthat the program is \"trivial\" and discards it. However, the next level\r\nthen fails an assertion because it does not reference the dummy row.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/d9a81b88ad561e7e4cedae93e805e0d7a53a7f1a/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/rex/RexProgram.java#L466\r\nSo basically this is a bug in the check. I'm not sure if there's a way\r\nto improve it so it works as intended, but removing it doesn't seem to\r\nhurt us any (not sure why this would cause an \"explosion in the search\r\nspace\"; in our case, it just results in an extra ZetaSQL rel, which the\r\nplanner cannot further optimize anyway).\r\n\r\nEDIT: see the individual commits for the complete list of changes to CalcRelSplitter.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds support for using the distributed `Series.std` and `Series.var` implementations from DataFrame. This works by:\r\n1. Making `Series.agg('std')` defer to the specialized `Series.std` (and similarly for `var`).\r\n2. Implementing `DataFrame.std` (and `var`) with `_agg_method`, which will leverage (1).\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Updated dependency jupyter-client from \">=6.1.11,<7\" to \">=6.1.11,<6.1.13\"\r\n    as the newest version 6.1.13 contains a bug\r\n    https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/issues/637 that breaks notebooks\r\n    when getting messages.\r\n2. This is caught by screen diff integration tests of interactive beam.\r\n3. Added a timeout=-1 to allow indefinite wait for execution of each\r\n   notebook cell in integration tests. The default value was 1 second.\r\n   Instead of timeout each cell, moved the timeout to each test using pytest mark.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

follow-up to PR #14164. This PR removes `withRunnerDeterminedShardingUnboundedInternal` option so users by default are allowed to use runner determined sharding. Also added a check if the input of `WriteFiles` requires windows to be merged since the current implement of runner determined sharding for unbouded data does not support merging windows yet.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

issue from BEAM-10854 and BEAM-11620, `PeriodicImpulse` would fail with default values.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n- Lines [40-44] from `periodicsequence.py` could go directly in `PeriodicImpulse` (after line 162). But this would only fix `PeriodicImpulse` and would fail if other users decide to use `Timestamp` instead of `Float` for the times.\r\n- lines [92-96] of `periodicsequence_test.py`, adding this line would work to check if the default values would work both for `start` and `end`. This would avoid new errors in case the transform is modified. Those lines could be removed if needed\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

includes:\r\n- `level=`: which is essentially an alias for `groupby(level=)`, and we implement it as such\r\n- `numeric_only=`: which allows users to specify how to handle numeric aggregations for non-numeric columns (True=drop, None=try to coerce or drop, False=try to coerce and raise on failure)\r\n- `bool_only=` the same thing for boolean aggregations (all, any) over non-boolean columns.\r\n- `skipna=` drops NaNs before aggregating.\r\n- `min_count=` requires Singleton partitioning.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous improvements included here:\r\n- `DeferredGroupBy.agg` now accepts string arguments.\r\n- `Deferred{DataFrame,Seres}.agg` now handle \"liftable with sum\" aggregations (BEAM-11978)\r\n\r\nNote the numeric aggregations (mean, sum, median, etc..) have an argument `numeric_only=` with the following behavior:\r\n- `True`: Just drop any column that doesn't have dtype int, float, or bool\r\n- `False`: Perform the aggregation on every column, raise an error if any are incompatible\r\n- `None` (default): Try to perform the aggregation, drop the ones that fail. \r\n\r\n`False` and `None` can do weird things like concatting a columns of Strings.\r\n\r\nWith the the default `None` mode we would not know which columns will be present until observing all the data (non-deferred columns). That means we can't implement it faithfully in our model, where we need to know the dtypes at construction time. So I've added logic to raise a `WontImplementError` when performing a numeric aggregation on a DataFrame with non-numeric columns, _unless_ the aggregation was performed with `numeric_only=False`.\r\n\r\nWe might consider adding similar logic for `bool_only`, which has the same behavior. However I think `bool_only=None` is much less risky, in general everything can be coerced into a boolean unless there's a column with `object` dtype containing objects where `__bool__` has been forbidden.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <thead>\r\n

Simplified the test to its barebone.\r\n2. Added logging in the utils module in case there is ImportError.\r\n3. Added pytest.mark.skipif in case unittest.skipIf is not working.\r\n4. The assumption is that somehow the flaky runs are executed by a tox\r\n   environment without necessary dependencies. The execution route\r\n   silently fall into the NOOP route (we'll now see warning logs if\r\n   flakiness happens again) and pytest doesn't skip the test.\r\n5. The root cause can still be inappropriate usage of global singleton in\r\n    the test environment. Thus added more Mocks to isolate the test from\r\n    accessing attributes of the global singleton.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Beam FileSystems for I/O to support multiple file systems instead of plain `open`.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of spam in the diffs, but the changes are mostly:\r\n\r\n* Change code snippets to use `FileSystems.open` and `FileSystems.create` along with converting to/from bytes.\r\n* Add a small description of why using them instead of just `open`.\r\n* Ran the whole notebook again to refresh the
