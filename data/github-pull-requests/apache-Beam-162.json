Options in Beam\r\nSchema add extra context to fields and schema. In contracts to\r\nmetadata, options would be added to fields, logical types and rows.\r\n\r\nOptions are key/typed value combination. The type system is using\r\nthe beam schema itself and the value can be any type that is supported\r\nby the beam schema, including row.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

The state and message streams got a little messy, as they're\r\ntreated as if they're independent, but at least in this implementation\r\nthe message stream is just a superset of the state stream (assuming that states last long enough to be picked up by both streams). To untangle\r\nthings a bit, I decided to a) allow duplicate messages and b) store\r\nmessage history, in addition to state history.\r\n- For unit testing, I added library `freezegun` to freeze time at 0,\r\nwhich was way easier than doing a bunch of elaborate mocking just to get\r\none insignificant value lined up.\r\n\r\nFollow-ups:\r\n- The Spark REST API will return errors if there's a problem with the\r\njob submission, but it doesn't return errors from the cluster itself\r\nonce the job is running. I couldn't figure out a good solution to this,\r\nso I left it as a TODO(BEAM-8983).\r\n- There should be an e2e test for this.

We do not expect to update the 1.x branch with features, although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year.\r\n> \r\n> ## Major Features and Improvements\r\n> * As [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/developers/iRCt5m4qUz0), `tensorflow` pip package will by default include GPU support (same as `tensorflow-gpu` now) for the platforms we currently have GPU support (Linux and Windows). It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` will still be available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\r\n> * TensorFlow 1.15 contains a complete implementation of the 2.0 API in its `compat.v2` module. It contains a copy of the 1.15 main module (without `contrib`) in the `compat.v1` module. TensorFlow 1.15 is able to emulate 2.0 behavior using the `enable_v2_behavior()` function.\r\n> This enables writing forward compatible code: by explicitly importing either `tensorflow.compat.v1` or `tensorflow.compat.v2`, you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of 1.15 or 2.0.\r\n> * `EagerTensor` now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\r\n> * Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\r\n> * Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\r\n> * AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with `tf.data`, `tf.distribute` and `tf.keras` APIS.\r\n> * Adds `enable_tensor_equality()`, which switches the behavior such that: \r\n>   * Tensors are no longer hashable.\r\n>   * Tensors can be compared with `==` and `!=`, yielding a Boolean Tensor with element-wise comparison results. This will be the default behavior in 2.0.\r\n> * Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\r\n> * Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to \"true\" or \"1\" forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic.\r\n> * TensorRT\r\n>   * Migrate TensorRT conversion sources from contrib to compiler directory in preparation for TF 2.0.\r\n>   * Add additional, user friendly `TrtGraphConverter` API for TensorRT conversion.\r\n>   * Expand support for TensorFlow operators in TensorRT conversion (e.g.\r\n>     `Gather`, `Slice`, `Pack`, `Unpack`, `ArgMin`, `ArgMax`,`DepthSpaceShuffle`). \r\n>   * Support TensorFlow operator `CombinedNonMaxSuppression` in TensorRT conversion which \r\n>      significantly accelerates object detection models.\r\n> \r\n> ## Breaking Changes\r\n> * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: `tensorflow_core` containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and `tensorflow` which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to `tensorflow_core` (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\r\n> * TensorFlow 1.15 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\r\n> * Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\r\n> * `tf.keras`:\r\n>   * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config. To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\r\n>   * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\r\n>   * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\r\n>   * Layers now default to `float32`, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used `float64`, it will probably silently use `float32` in TensorFlow2, and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer \"layer-name\" is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\r\n>   * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time (i.e. when this Python line executes) if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the session.run(). When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\r\n> \r\n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n> * `tf.estimator`:\r\n>   * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint` format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n>   * Fix tests in canned estimators.\r\n>   * Expose Head as public API.\r\n>   * Fixes critical bugs that help with `DenseFeatures` usability in TF2\r\n> * `tf.data`:\r\n>   * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\r\n>   * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\r\n> * `tf.keras`:\r\n>   * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to tf.train.Checkpoint format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\r\n>   * Saving a Keras Model using `tf.saved_model.save` now saves the list of variables, trainable variables, regularization losses, and the call function.\r\n>   * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\r\n>   * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\r\n></tr></table> ...

To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\n>   * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\n>   * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\n>   * Layers now default to `float32`, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used `float64`, it will probably silently use `float32` in TensorFlow2, and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer \"layer-name\" is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\n>   * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time (i.e. when this Python line executes) if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the session.run(). When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\n> \n> ## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n> * `tf.estimator`:\n>   * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint` format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\n>   * Fix tests in canned estimators.\n>   * Expose Head as public API.\n>   * Fixes critical bugs that help with `DenseFeatures` usability in TF2\n> * `tf.data`:\n>   * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\n>   * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\n> * `tf.keras`:\n>   * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to tf.train.Checkpoint format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\n>   * Saving a Keras Model using `tf.saved_model.save` now saves the list of variables, trainable variables, regularization losses, and the call function.\n>   * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\n>   * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\n>   * Enable the Keras compile API `experimental_run_tf_function` flag by default. This flag enables single training/eval/predict execution path. With this 1. All input types are converted to `Dataset`. 2. When distribution strategy is not specified this goes through the no-op distribution strategy path. 3. Execution is wrapped in tf.function unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile.\n>   * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\n> * `tf.lite`\n>   * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\n>   * tflite object detection script has a debug mode.\n>   * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\n>   * Added evaluation script for COCO minival.\n>   * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\n>   * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\n> * Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\n></tr></table> ...

UnboundedThreadWorkerExecutor in bundle progress report introduces performance complications (by using too many threads. Experiment shows that a typical streaming wordcount pipeline which can deal with 360 messages/(second, worker) is only capable of process around 200 messages/(second, worker) with same resource. This PR aim to mitigate the performance and cost change of existing pipeline by change the use of UnboundedThreadWorkerExecutor in bundle progress report to just single thread executor.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

FlinkMetricContainer wraps the Beam metric container for reporting metrics,\r\nbut also stores them as Flink accumulators. With high parallelism jobs with over\r\na thousand tasks and many built-in Beam metrics for every Beam step, this can\r\naccumulate to over 100MB of serialized data which is stored in the JobManager's\r\nExecutionGraph. This then fails to even sent over the wire, due to the\r\nakka.framesize limit (10MB by default), and manifests in {{500 Internal Server\r\nError}}s in the web frontend.\r\n\r\nThis introduces an option to disable the reporting via accumulators. The\r\naccumulator is mostly useful for batch workloads where you can retrieve the\r\nfinal accumulator values at the end of the job. It adds a lot of memory and\r\nnetwork overhead.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we might disable it by default on streaming workloads.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

a potential OOM when very narrow row mutations are added (ie\r\n<5 cells, <100 bytes).\r\n\r\nThe overhead of storing a mutation is significant, so with the default\r\ngrouping of 5000*1000 cells, potentially many millions of mutated rows\r\ncan be stored in memory during the grouping phase, leading to an OOM.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a 3rd limit on the grouping - that a maximum of 500 rows\r\nper batch (500K rows in the grouping stage).\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

`installGcpTest` task is installing SDK in developer mode (aka editable mode via `pip install -e`), which creates a race condition with the task  `:sdk:python:sdist`, because the order of execution is not established, and both tasks modify the SDK sources at proto stub generation step, see BEAM-8481 for pointers. \r\n\r\nThis change establishes a depends-on relationship, which enforces that sdist must finish before installation. Installing SDK from a tarball would provide a better isolation and be closer to the typical installation scenario.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10238, have the state channels properly terminate & clean themselves up on errors, and allow themselves to be recreated by the manager. Bundles using a bad StateChannel will fail one way or another (their readers will return errors up to them), but subsequent creations will no longer be poisoned. Runners can then retry the bundles at their discretion.\r\n\r\nThis affects anything reading (and arguably, writing) on the State service, which includes Side Inputs, State Backed Iterables for CoGBKs, and when the Go SDK eventually has State API support.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\nExtends read / readFiles builders to support an extra argument, allowing users to configure the data model that the ParquetAvroReader's wrapped AvroReadSupport class uses. We're running these changes locally, and they allow us to use avro4s to convert from GenericRecords to Scala case classes without having to extend IndexedRecords/SpecificData (we're using Scio but utilizing Beam's ParquetIO rather than Scio's Parquet support). I'd like to get some feedback from the Parquet owners on the approach; I'm not sure if there's a better way to drive ParquetAvroReader configuration from Beam applications. This is my first PR against the Beam project, so let me know if there's anything I missed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added pipeline_fragment module to build pipeline fragments including\r\nonly transforms necessary to produce user-desired PCollections and\r\nimplicitly execute the fragment to emit data for user-desired\r\nPCollections.\r\n2. Added the notion of cached PCollection completeness. Only cache of\r\ncompletely computed PCollections can be read. `p.run()` of the\r\nInteractiveRunner by default displays the pipeline graph and doesn't use\r\nany cached intermediate PCollections but generates new cache for them.\r\n3. Whenever a pipeline fragment is executed, by default the implicit\r\npipeline run doesn't display pipeline graph but uses available cached\r\nintermediate PCollections and generates cache for PCollections haven't\r\nbeen computed.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added [interactive] as extras for py36 and py37 gcp tests so they\r\nwill be executed at least once during the pre-commit. The [interactive]\r\ndependencies were removed after PR #10227 deprecating the old setup config,\r\nthus not triggering any pcoll_visualization tests since then.\r\n2. Fixed the Setup routine of pcoll_visualization_tests so that global\r\nenvironment is always fresh no matter how the unit tests modify its\r\nstates. The bug was caused by wrong execution paths instructed by\r\nundeterministic tests execution sequence. Somehow, the unittest's patch\r\nutility fails to patch _to_element_list some times in multi-threading.\r\nUsing InteractiveRunner when building pipelines to lazily initialize a\r\ncache manager for those scenarios.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
