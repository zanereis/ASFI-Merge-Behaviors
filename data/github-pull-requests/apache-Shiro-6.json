https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

today's release, 33.2.0. These releases have begun adding Java 8+ APIs to <code>guava-android</code>. While we don't anticipate problems, we do anticipate that any unexpected problems could force a disruptive rollback. To minimize any disruption, we'd like to catch any such problems early.</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=type%3Ddefect&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yaml\">let us know of any problems you encounter</a>.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.2.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.2.0-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Jar files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.2.0-jre/guava-33.2.0-jre.jar\">33.2.0-jre.jar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.2.0-android/guava-33.2.0-android.jar\">33.2.0-android.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guava requires <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">one runtime dependency</a>, which you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/failureaccess/1.0.1/failureaccess-1.0.1.jar\">failureaccess-1.0.1.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Javadoc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-jre/api/docs/\">33.2.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-android/api/docs/\">33.2.0-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JDiff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-jre/api/diffs/\">33.2.0-jre vs. 33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-android/api/diffs/\">33.2.0-android vs. 33.1.0-android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/33.2.0-android/api/androiddiffs/\">33.2.0-android vs. 33.2.0-jre</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped testing for Android versions before Lollipop (API Level 21).

(858caf425c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made our <code>Collector</code> APIs (e.g., <code>ImmutableList.toImmutableList()</code>) available in <code>guava-android</code>. More <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6567\">Java 8 APIs</a> will follow in future releases.

(But note that we test only with library desugaring, so we don't currently know if API Level 24 is high enough to use our <code>Collector</code> APIs unless you have also enabled library desugaring.) Guava users who <em>avoid</em> the <code>Collector</code> APIs do <em>not</em> need to meet this requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Fixed a potential <code>NullPointerException</code> in <code>ImmutableMap.Builder</code> on a rare code path. (70a98115d8)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constants <code>Ad-Auction-Allowed</code>, <code>Permissions-Policy-Report-Only</code>, and <code>Sec-GPC</code>.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License

EE module has to decorate `SecurityManager` since SecurityManager is designed to be customized / inherited by the user.\r\nIn order to do this, it introduced `WrappedSecurityManager`\r\nUnfortunately, `SecurityUtils` classes would return the `WrappedSecurityManager` instance and there is no way to return the original customized `SecurityManager` as WrappedSecurityManager is not a superclass of the customized SecurityManager\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `SecurityUtils.getSecurityManager(Class<> type)` to avoid casts to custom `SecurityManager` implementations by the user and unwraps the original if necessary\r\n\r\n- Added `getSecurityManager(Class<> type)` that returns typed / unwrapped SM, or an exception to `SecurityUtils`\r\n- Added `isSecurityManagerTypeOf(Class<> type)` to `SecurityUtils`\r\n- Added  `unwrapSecurityManager` to `SecurityUtils`\r\n- Added `WrappedSecurityManager` interface for wrapped `SecurityManager` implementations\r\n- Made Jakarta EE module use the new interface\r\n\r\nfixes #1424 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

support for custom `SecurityManager` implementations.\r\n\r\n- Moved unwrapSecurityManager into `ShiroFilter` and made it public\r\n- Easily override EE `IniEnvironment` to override `SecurityManager` implementation\r\n\r\nfixes #1424 \r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

[com.hazelcast:hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast) from 5.3.7 to 5.4.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">com.hazelcast:hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.4.0</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.4.0 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>CAUTION: Starting with this release of Hazelcast Platform, the minimum supported Java version is 17.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>User Code Namespaces: Enable deployment and redeployment of your custom classes. See the User Code Namespaces documentation.</li>\n<li>CPMap: Added CPMap as a minimal key-value CP data structure. See CPMap documentation. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25802\">#25802</a></li>\n<li>Thread-Per-Core (TPC): TPC is now generally available. You can enable this feature on the clients and cluster members for improved performance. See the Thread-Per-Core (TPC) documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>MergingValue</code> interface within the SPI package now requires the <code>getDeserializedValue()</code> method to be defined within implementations, replacing the <code>getValue()</code> definition. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25942\">#25942</a></li>\n<li>Moved the MongoDB connector to the extensions module, that is, its classes and related dependencies relocated;\nif you are using Maven to install the connector, you must add <code>&lt;classifier&gt;jar-with-dependencies&lt;/classifier&gt;</code> to your <code>pom.xml</code>.\nAlso removed the permissions for MongoDB connector. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25744\">#25744</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25701\">#25701</a></li>\n<li>Method names used as parameters in <a href=\"https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/SecurityInterceptor.html%5B%60SecurityInterceptor%60%5D\">https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/security/SecurityInterceptor.html[`SecurityInterceptor`]</a> checks were reviewed and unified into a single place  - class <code>com.hazelcast.security.SecurityInterceptorConstants</code>. Some client messages have the method name changed to reflect their purpose better. Some client messages are newly covered by <code>SecurityInterceptor</code> checks now. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25020\">#25020</a></li>\n<li>Renamed the service port for Hazelcast clusters deployed in Kubernetes environments to <code>hazelcast</code>.\nThe previous name, <code>hazelcast-service-port</code>, caused member auto-discovery for embedded deployments to fail. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24834\">#24834</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24705\">#24705</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24688\">#24688</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where Hazelcast was not failing fast when a member is started with a blank public address. This has been fixed by introducing a configuration validation\nthat might break any existing, but invalid, configuration. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/24729\">#24729</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>SQL/Jet Engine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the beta annotations from the data connection classes. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/26000\">#26000</a></li>\n<li>Replaced the user-defined types (UDTs) feature flag with the cyclic UDT feature flag, to prevent querying such type data. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25977\">#25977</a></li>\n<li>Added support for loading and storing a single column as the value using the <code>GenericMapStore</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/25878\">#25878</a></li>\n<li>Each Jet engine job was creating a client for connecting to the remote cluster, resulting in an excessive number of clients.

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

[com.google.guava:guava](https://github.com/google/guava) from 33.0.0-jre to 33.1.0-jre.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases\">com.google.guava:guava's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>33.1.0</h2>\n<h3>Request for Android users</h3>\n<p>If you know of Guava Android users who have not yet upgraded to at least the previous release <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v33.0.0\">33.0.0</a>, please encourage them to do so. Starting with that version, we are experimenting with including Java 8+ APIs in <code>guava-android</code>. Before we commit to adding such APIs, we want as much testing as we can get: If we later expose a set of Java 8+ APIs and then discover that they break users, we won't want to remove them, as the removal would break users, too.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Jar files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-jre/guava-33.1.0-jre.jar\">33.1.0-jre.jar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-android/guava-33.1.0-android.jar\">33.1.0-android.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guava requires <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">one runtime dependency</a>, which you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/failureaccess/1.0.1/failureaccess-1.0.1.jar\">failureaccess-1.0.1.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Javadoc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/docs/\">33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/docs/\">33.1.0-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JDiff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-jre vs. 33.0.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.0.0-android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/androiddiffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated our Error Prone dependency to 2.26.1, which includes a JPMS-ready jar of annotations. If you use the Error Prone annotations in a modular build of your own code, you may need to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">add a <code>requires</code> line for them</a>. (d48c6dfbb8, c6e91c498ced26631029d1bdfdb9154d4a217368)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added a <code>Duration</code> overload for <code>Suppliers.memoizeWithExpiration</code>. (76e46ec35b)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Deprecated the remaining two overloads of <code>Throwables.propagateIfPossible</code>. They won't be deleted, but we recommend migrating off them. (cf86414a87)</li>\n<li><code>cache</code>: Fixed a bug that could cause <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/pull/6851#issuecomment-1931276822\">false &quot;recursive load&quot; reports during refresh</a>. (0e1aebf73e)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the return types of <code>transitiveClosure()</code> and <code>reachableNodes()</code> to <code>Immutable*</code> types. <code>reachableNodes()</code> already returned an immutable object (even though that was not reflected in the declared return type); <code>transitiveClosure()</code> used to return a mutable object. The old signatures remain available, so this change does not break binary compatibility. (09e655f6c1)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the behavior of views returned by graph accessor methods that take a graph element as input: They now throw <code>IllegalStateException</code> when that element is removed from the graph. (8dca776341)</li>\n<li><code>hash</code>: Optimized <code>Checksum</code>-based hash functions for Java 9+. (afb35a5d1b)</li>\n<li><code>testing</code>: Exposed <code>FakeTicker</code> <code>Duration</code> methods to Android users. (f346bbb6a7)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the constructors of <code>UncheckedExecutionException</code> and <code>ExecutionError</code> that don't accept a cause. We won't remove these constructors, but we recommend migrating off them, as users of those classes often assume that instances will contain a cause. (1bb3c4386b)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Improved the correctness of racy accesses for J2ObjC users.

optional in `shiro-core`\r\nfixes #1352 \r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version
