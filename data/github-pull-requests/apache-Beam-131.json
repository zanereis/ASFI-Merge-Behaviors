we introduce custom containers (mostly for Python), there are a couple of misleading or unclear log messages.\r\n\r\n* PortableRunner currently attempts to pull the container and ignores errors, defaulting to local images. Logging added to make this path clearer.\r\n\r\n* DockerEnvironment.default_docker_image can be called even if we don't use the default image - currently this outputs a message saying `Using default image \"...\"` which is very confusing. I edited to make sure it's clearer when we are using provided container image vs default container image.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR includes everything I've worked on in the Go ValidatesRunner framework so far, for initial review. Note that it includes the contents of PR #13502 as the first commit since it's a required for this code to work, but that should be reviewed in its own PR. This PR only covers the second commit.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a new subdirectory, test/validatesrunner, that is intended to just contain a bunch of tests that run and validate lightweight pipelines. It also contains a script that handles starting job servers and expansion services, similar to run_integration_tests.sh, and one initially tested gradle build rule for running it with Flink. Running with the direct runner also works fine, with the command \"go test validatesrunner/... --runner=direct\". Currently, the script has only been confirmed to work with Flink and the direct runner, but it should theoretically work with the Portable runner and Spark as well, once appropriate gradle build rules are figured out.\r\n\r\nMost of the contents here are likely to be transient, chances are this will be merged to be an update to the existing integration directory rather than a whole new directory, and will just replace the existing driver approach to the tests. However, this is still valuable to commit as a starting point to the work.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

issues were found and fixed while working on the ValidatesRunner framework, but are not directly related, so they're good candidates for a setup commit. The fixes:\r\n\r\n1. Fixed an issue in graphx/xlang.go where the output PCollection of a composite containing an external transform wasn't being renamed properly, resulting in an error due to the composite containing a non-existent output. This was only caught when testing the Flink Runner, tests still passed with the Python Portable Runner.\r\n\r\n2. Added a check to cross-compiling code to detect if the pipeline is being executed through go test, so an appropriate cross-compilation can be done for tests. This enables running pipelines from tests with portable runners.\r\n\r\n3. Added a new helper function to ptest for convenience.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

most natural filter for Bigtable would be `SELECT * FROM table WHERE key BETWEEN 'key0' AND 'key1'` or `WHERE key >= 'key0' AND key < 'key9'`\r\n\r\nBut:\r\n\r\n`WHERE key >= 'key0' AND key < 'key4'` is not parsed as `AND(>=(key, 'key0'), <(key, 'key4'))` but as list of independent conditions: `[>=(key, 'key0'), <(key, 'key4')]` (it is required to use it together with OR to force it to be translated that way)\r\n\r\nThe same with BETWEEN - `WHERE key BETWEEN 'key0' AND 'key4'` is translated to `[>=(key, 'key0'), <=(key, 'key4')]` instead of `BETWEEN(key, 'key0', 'key1')`\r\n\r\nSo for now only regex filter work, as follows: `WHERE key LIKE '^key[0123]'`\r\n\r\nOther filters are not relevant to Bigtable because it doesn't allow to specify which particular cell we want to apply the filter. It could eventually be done as TBLPROPERTIES param, but I suppose that filtering by key is the most common case.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

work aims to automatically update the capability matrix with each project release to keep it up to date with minimum supervision or ownership. \r\nThe workflow of the approach is as follows: \r\n\r\n- A script will run periodically, and using the latest runs from relevant test suites from Jenkins, it outputs a capability matrix data file in JSON format\r\n- The capability matrix file is uploaded to a public folder in GCS\r\n- The Beam website will fetch the capability matrix file every time a user loads the Capability Matrix pagefile, and build the matrix\r\n\r\nThe ValidatesRunner tests of Beam validate different capabilities for each runner. Every runner has a Jenkins job which runs its ValidatesRunner test suite. Running a validate runner test indicates that the runner provides that particular capability. \r\nThe current implementation fetches the different test cases which are run/not run with the status for each runner.\r\n\r\nSample output file: https://gist.github.com/sruthiskumar/3fd6e5789ee181e6b9331534c4ebdf05\r\n@pabloem can you please review the PR\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Dataflow runs portable python pipelines, such as all Python streaming pipelines and all pipelines on Runner V2, Dataflow service currently starts as many SDK containers as there are CPU cores on the VMs. \r\n\r\nThis behavior was originally initiated by the SDK setting an experiment use_multiple_sdk_containers, and it was possible to disable this behavior  by supplying `--experiment=no_use_multiple_sdk_containers`. \r\n\r\nDataflow service no longer needs SDK to supply these experiments, so we clean up this logic. \r\n\r\nDataflow service may still recognize `--experiment=no_use_multiple_sdk_containers` for some time but it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use this knob: in the future Dataflow may have better algorithms for deciding how many SDK containers to start, and specifying this knob may interfere with these algorithms.\r\n\r\nUsers can control the number of cores on the VMs by setting an appropriate `--machine_type`. Note that there are custom machine types, where users can select number of cores and number of memory GBs, such as `--machine_type=custom-1-13312-ext` which will have 1 core and 13GB memory.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this while working on a somewhat larger change.\r\n\r\nSome things are done in shared test setup that really should not be\r\n\r\n - the setup is so trivial it doesn't save any mental space or code space\r\n - the setup is relevant only for some test cases\r\n - it actually mixes different windows in weird ways, seemingly to shoehorn all the test cases\r\n   into the same test setup\r\n - the setup does not encapsulate anything meaningful; to understand a test case, it is necessary to read and remember the details of the setup.\r\n\r\nThese are inlined so each test is more independently readable and has no\r\nirrelevant coupling.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

modifies FakePandasObject to handle cases like `pd.DataFrame({'col': pd.Series(..)})`. Previously the `pd.Series` would be replaced with a DeferredSeries and passed to `pd.DataFrame`. With this change we identify DeferredBase instances in the args and replace them with their original value.\r\n\r\nNote that this effectively duplicates the inline object in the input_env. I considered creating a computed expression that refers to the original instead, but this seems overly complicated for little benefit.\r\n\r\nThis fixes a few cases in the user guide. Before:\r\n```\r\n  882 failed (17.7%)\r\n  2432 passed (48.8%)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n  868 failed (17.4%)\r\n  2498 passed (50.1%)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

The new version removes the dependency on the shadowjar task from the build task. This would cause the shadow jar not to be built in certain cases.\r\nSee [BEAM-10986] for more info.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the shadow jar plugin uses the latest gradle apis to take advantage of the build cache.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

my comment on BEAM-9187 for an explanation of what seems to have caused the flakes:\r\n\r\n> It seems that, in the error case, what's happening is as soon as the forked thread releases the semaphore [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/5e9237cd425da92a98536ba598a6217c21b31286/runners/java-fn-execution/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/fnexecution/control/DefaultJobBundleFactory.java#L560), the main thread continues, [creating the bundle](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/5e9237cd425da92a98536ba598a6217c21b31286/runners/java-fn-execution/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/runners/fnexecution/control/DefaultJobBundleFactoryTest.java#L478), and then making the assertions. However since we left the forked thread, it never got out of the b2.close() call and [set the boolean](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/5e9237cd425da92a98536ba598a6217c21b31286/runners/java-fn-execution/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/runners/fnexecution/control/DefaultJobBundleFactoryTest.java#L470).\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses it by replacing the `TimerTask` and `AtomicBoolean` with a `ScheduledFuture`. We then make an assertion on the result of the scheduled future, including a small delay to make sure the main thread will block and give the forked thread a chance to run.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

some conditions, `translations.pipeline_from_stages()` after `translations.sort_stages()` could return a pipeline that was not topologically sorted due the construction of the tree of parents to subtransforms. This change ensures that the pipeline is topologically ordered by ensuring that when a transform is added to the pipeline, each of its ancestors become the last subtransform of its parent.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This is needed by some external metric aggregation services to indicate when the reporter of the metric first began collecting the cumulative value for the timeseries. If the SDK Harness restarts, it should reset the start_time, and reset the collection of cumulative metrics (i.e. start to count again from 0). HarnessMonitoringInfos should set this start_time once, when the MonitoringInfo is first reported. ProcessBundle MonitoringInfos should set a start_time for each bundle.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nThank you for your contribution!
