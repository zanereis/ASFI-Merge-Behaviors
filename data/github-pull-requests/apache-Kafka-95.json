main purpose of this patch is to add `quorum.linger.ms` behavior to the raft implementation. This gives users a powerful knob to tune the impact of fsync.  When an append is accepted from the state machine, it is held in an accumulator (similar to the producer) until the configured linger time is exceeded. This allows the implementation to amortize fsync overhead at the expense of some write latency.\r\n\r\nThe patch also improves our methodology for testing performance. Up to now, we have relied on the producer performance test, but it is difficult to simulate expected controller loads because producer performance is limited by other factors such as the number of producer clients and head-of-line blocking. Instead, this patch adds a workload generator which runs on the leader after election.\r\n\r\nFinally, this patch brings us nearer to the write semantics expected by the KIP-500 controller. It makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Introduce `RecordSerde<T>` interface which abstracts the underlying log implementation from `RaftClient`. The generic type is carried over to `RaftClient<T>` and is exposed through the read/write APIs.\r\n- `RaftClient.append` is changed to `RaftClient.scheduleAppend` and returns the last offset of the expected log append.\r\n- `RaftClient.scheduleAppend` accepts a list of records and ensures that the full set are included in a single batch.\r\n- Introduce `RaftClient.Listener` with a single `handleCommit` API which will eventually replace `RaftClient.read` in order to surface committed data to the controller state machine. Currently `handleCommit` is only used for records appended by the leader.\r\n\r\n(Note that this patch piggybacks on top of #9352. I will rebase as soon as this PR has been merged.)","created_at":"2020-10-12T23:06:10Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T13:17:08Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T19:10:14Z","merged_at":"2020-10-27T19:10:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"927edfece3db8aab7d01850955f9a65e5c110da5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/fac5c0a9507f9f40f99dac017242d12500a97d5d","head":{"label":"hachikuji:raft-append-refactor","ref":"raft-append-refactor","sha":"fac5c0a9507f9f40f99dac017242d12500a97d5d","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35842084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0MjA4NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"hachikuji/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji/kafka","description":"Mirror

a coordinator module is being elected / resigned, our log entry is usually associated with a background scheduler on loading / unloading entries and hence it is unclear at the exact time when the election or resignation happens, and we have to then compare with the KafkaAPI's log entry for leaderAndISR / StopReplica to infer the actual time. I think add a couple new log entries indicating the exact time when it happens is helpful.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10494\r\n\r\nNodes that are materialized should not forward requests to `enableSendingOldValues` to parent nodes, as they themselves can handle fulfilling this request. However, some instances of `KTableProcessorSupplier` were still forwarding requests to parent nodes, which was causing unnecessary materialization of table sources.\r\n\r\nThe following instances of `KTableProcessorSupplier` have been updated to not forward `enableSendingOldValues` to parent nodes if they themselves are materialized and can handle sending old values downstream:\r\n\r\n * `KTableMapValues`\r\n * `KTableTransformValues`\r\n\r\nOther instances of `KTableProcessorSupplier` have not be modified for reasons given below:\r\n * `KTableSuppressProcessorSupplier`: though it has a `storeName` field, it didn't seem right for this to handle sending old values itself. It's only job is to suppress output.\r\n * `KTableKTableAbstractJoin`: doesn't have a store name, i.e. it is never materialized, so can't handle the call itself.\r\n * `KTableKTableJoinMerger`: table-table joins already have materialized sources, which are sending old values. It would be an unnecessary performance hit to have this class do a lookup to retrieve the old value from its store.\r\n * `KTableReduce`: is always materialized and already handling the call without forwarding\r\n * `KTableAggregate`: is always materialized and already handling the call without forwarding\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

commit adds a new replication policy for MirrorMaker 2, `LegacyReplicationPolicy`. This policy imitates MirrorMaker 1 behavior of not renaming replicated topics. The exception is made for `heartbeats` topic, that is replicated according to `DefaultReplicationPolicy`.\r\n\r\nAvoiding renaming topics brings a number of limitations, among which the most important one is the impossibility of detecting replication cycles. This makes cross-replication using `LegacyReplicationPolicy` effectively impossible. See `LegacyReplicationPolicy` Javadoc for details.\r\n\r\nA new method `canTrackSource` is added to `ReplicationPolicy`. Its result indicates if the replication policy can track back to the source topic of a topic. It is needed to allow detecting target topics work when `LegacyReplicationPolicy` is used.\r\n\r\nOn the testing side, the tests have the same strategy as for `DefaultReplicationPolicy` with nicessary adjustments (e.g. no active/active replication is tested).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

this PR, I have addressed the review comments from @chia7712 in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9001 which were provided after https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9001 was merged. The changes are made mainly to `KafkaAdminClient`:\r\n1. Improve error message in `updateFeatures` api when feature name is empty.\r\n2. Propagate top-level error message in `updateFeatures` api.\r\n3. Add an empty-parameter variety for `describeFeatures` api.\r\n4. Minor documentation updates to `@param` and `@return` to make these resemble other apis.\r\n\r\n**Test plan:**\r\nRelying on existing unit and integration

PR adds missing broker ACLs required to create topics and SCRAM credentials when ACLs are enabled for a system test.

special byte sequence `0xEF, 0xBF, 0xBF`, when parsed as a UTF-8 string, causes the `StringCharacterIterator` to return `CharacterIterator.DONE` from its `next()`, `current()`, and other similar methods. This caused an infinite loop in the `Values` class whenever that byte sequence was encountered.\r\n\r\nThe fix is pretty simple. To see if we're at the end of a string, we compare `StandardCharacterIterator::getIndex` to `StandardCharacterIterator::getEndIndex`, instead of comparing the last-read character to `CharacterIterator.DONE` (since that character may occur in strings that we're parsing).\r\n\r\nI've added a unit test that replicates this bug (when the fix in the `Values` class is not present). I gave it a timeout of five seconds in case someone accidentally re-creates the infinite loop in order to save some time and potential confusion.\r\n\r\nAll existing unit tests for the `Values` class pass with this change.\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

introduces a new **compile-only** dependency on [JetBrains Java Annotations](https://github.com/JetBrains/java-annotations). I decided to go for this particular dependency because it does not introduce any visible change to our users, nor does it introduce any additional overhead to the build process. If we get an annotation wrong, nothing bad happens because it is totally up to the code to actually validate things. (This also means that no KIP is required.)\r\n\r\nOne downside (some might say upside) is that absolutely everything must be annotated. I personally think this is a good thing because it forces people to actually think about `null`, same is the case in Kotlin where I also have to define whether `null` is permitted or not absolutely everywhere. Kotlin is also the main reason why I am interested in this, and also why I am interested in having this everywhere.\r\n\r\nI was not able to test all possible NPE situations because some require the call to actually be executed. For those where I was able to prove that `null` is invalid we could think about adding `Objects.requireNonNull` guards right at the beginning. For all others it is simple, if we prove it we can add the guards too. This might be wasteful for collections (especially if those collections contain collections). A possible way out here is to use `assert` and live with the fact that some NPEs are thrown much later and will make it hard to find the source. This, sadly, is not Kotlin, so there is no easy way for this.\r\n\r\n## Bugfix\r\n~This PR also contains a bug fix. `Admin.describeUserScramCredentials()` (without any arguments) is passing `null` to `Admin.describeUserScramCredentials(List<String>)` which is permitted but leads to an NPE. Maybe there is another ticket for this, or nobody ever called this method (which would raise the question why it exists). In any event, I changed `KafkaAdminClient` to use an empty list if `null` is passed.~ See https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9374, I will update the description and this branch once the other PR is in trunk.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**PS:** I am willing to continue this endeavor if it is decided to accept this PR (also if we decide to opt for another library that provides the ability to add null checks, e.g. Checker Framework, Lombok), simply because the experience in Kotlin with Kafka and the missing nullability information is horrid.\r\n\r\n**PPS:** The JetBrains annotations contain additional annotations for [`@Unmodifiable`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.jetbrains/annotations/latest/org/jetbrains/annotations/Unmodifiable.html), [`@ApiStatus.Internal`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.jetbrains/annotations/latest/org/jetbrains/annotations/ApiStatus.Internal.html), [`@RegExp`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.jetbrains/annotations/latest/org/intellij/lang/annotations/RegExp.html), and [many more](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.jetbrains/annotations/latest/index.html) that ease development work tremendously. I think it would be more than worthwhile to start using them as well if we decide to go with these annotations.\r\n\r\n—

The\r\npresence of this file indicates that the broker had a clean shutdown and\r\nlog recovery is not needed upon the next boot up.\r\n\r\nEarlier, LogManager would check for this file at the start of log loading workflow,\r\nand delete it after the log has been loaded. If the broker were to crash\r\nwhile loading logs, the file would not be deleted and mislead LogManager when it\r\ntries to load logs upon next boot up. Hence, a crash during log loading\r\nwill not be considered a hard reset of broker.\r\n\r\nAs part of this fix, we delete the clean shutdown file as soon as we\r\nlook it up, at the start of log loading workflow. Thereafter, we maintain a boolean\r\nflag to indicate if broker underwent clean shutdown or not. So, if the\r\nbroker were to crash while logs are being loaded, LogManager will be\r\nable to detect this as a hard reset.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

`AlterIsr` with KIP-497, the controller would register watches in Zookeeper for each reassigning partition so that it could be notified immediately when the ISR was expanded and the reassignment could be completed. This notification is not needed with the latest IBP when `AlterIsr` is enabled because the controller will execute all ISR changes itself.\r\n\r\nThere is one subtle detail. If we are in the middle of a roll in order to bump the IBP, then it is possible for the controller to be on the latest IBP while some of the brokers are still on the older one. In this case, the brokers on the older IBP will not send `AlterIsr`, but we can still rely on the delayed notification through the `isr_notifications` path to complete reassignments. This seems like a reasonable tradeoff since it should be a short window before the roll is completed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

patch adds missing flush logic to `KafkaRaftClient`. The initial flushing behavior is simplistic. We guarantee that the leader will not replicate above the last flushed offset and we guarantee that the follower will not fetch data above its own flush point. More sophisticated flush behavior is proposed in KAFKA-10526.\r\n\r\nWe have also extended the simulation test so that it covers flush behavior. When a node is shutdown, all unflushed data is lost. We were able to confirm that the monotonic high watermark invariant fails without the added `flush` calls.\r\n\r\nThis patch also piggybacks a fix to the `TestRaftServer` implementation. The initial check-in contained a bug which caused `RequestChannel` to fail sending responses because the disabled APIs did not have metrics registered. As a result of this, it is impossible to elect leaders.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-29T18:40:19Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T15:59:03Z","closed_at":"2020-10-13T15:59:03Z","merged_at":"2020-10-13T15:59:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"a72f0c1eac67d531a4725d3e48dcab4dce361b95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9352/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9352/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9352/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bceb07ff9233d969d13108c3d15fefbe665ed873","head":{"label":"hachikuji:KAFKA-10533","ref":"KAFKA-10533","sha":"bceb07ff9233d969d13108c3d15fefbe665ed873","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35842084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0MjA4NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"hachikuji/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji/kafka","description":"Mirror

had proposed to keep returning the `ThrottlingQuotaExceededException` to the called even when the request times out due to reaching `default.api.timeout.ms`. The current implementation does not cover this yet.\r\n\r\nFrom KIP-599:\r\n> Once `default.api.timeout.ms` has been reached, the topics which were throttled will return the `ThrottlingQuotaExceededException` to the caller.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the logic to preserve the `ThrottlingQuotaExceededException` when topics are retried. The `throttleTimeMs` is also adjusted accordingly as the request could remain pending or in-flight for quite a long time.\r\n\r\nI have run various tests on clusters with enabled quotas and I, indeed, find it better to preserve the exception. Otherwise, the caller does not really understand what is going on. This allows the caller to take the appropriate measure and also to take the `throttleTimeMs` into consideration.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design
