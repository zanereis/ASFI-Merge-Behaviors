Docker Desktop - particularly on Mac OS disabled creation of /var/run/docker.sock by default, leaving it only as advanced option, thus deprecating the \"default\" context for docker.\r\n\r\nSo far we recommended to enable the option for Breeze, but this change allows to autodetect if there is a \"desktop-linux\" context available (which uses a user-home-dir socket instead of the global /var/run one) and if it gets detected, \"desktop-linux\" context is used.\r\n\r\nThis is slightly more complicated, because we need to also leave the ``--builder`` available for cases where our auto-detection fails, so we need to expose the option in all commands that might attempt to build image automatically, we also need to find and forward the right socket to inside breeze - as we cannot unconditionally forward the /var/run/docker.sock.\r\n\r\nAlongside the chage \"static-checks\" command gets the same capability of rebuilding the CI image automatically.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to

Apache Airflow version\r\n\r\nmain (development) (not released)\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a new bug introduced when finalizing AIP-50 and adjusting the trigger button behavior: Irrespective of the flag to unpause a DAG when using the Trigger UI, calling always un-pauses.\r\n\r\n### What you think should happen instead\r\n\r\nLike advertised in the UI it should only be un-paused if the user selects so.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n* Start Airflow, open the UI, use a *disabled* DAG with parameters. Click on the trigger UI\r\n* Disable the \"un-pause when paused\" switch and trigger. Un-pause will be made even if not desired\r\n\r\nRoot cause: The un-pause flag was added into the trigger URL and irrespective of the form value the URL parameter overrules the form setting.\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nUbuntu 20.04 / Breeze Dev setup in Py 3.8 Container\r\n\r\n### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers\r\n\r\nNo specific setup, execution in Breeze from latest main\r\n\r\n### Deployment\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\n### Deployment details\r\n\r\nDevelopment setup via `breeze start-airflow...`\r\nPython 3.8\r\nPostgres\r\nCelery worker\r\n\r\n### Anything else\r\n\r\nTo improve visibility I added a flash() message as a reminder that unpause is needed. Removed the unpause URL parameter.\r\n\r\nWith this PR the behavior changes as follows:\r\n* If DAG has no parameters and user triggers (w/o) form: A flash message will be shown if DAG is un-paused implicitly/automatically\r\n* If DAG has parameters and user switches off the \"Un-pause\" button a warning will be displayed that DAG is paused.\r\n\r\nThis PR will very probably generate a merge conflict with PR #31301 which is still not merged :-( Will resolve it...\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to submit PR?\r\n\r\n- [X] Yes I am willing to submit a PR!\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X]

PR (link [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31920)) removes all non-official elasticsearch library and use only the official elasticsearch library. After the PR was merged, reading remote logs from ES has failed due to a bug introduced in the PR. \r\n\r\nIn particular, when reading remote logs, the webserver produced the following elasticsearch exception when sending a POST request to ES endpoint `/_all/count`: \r\n\r\n`elasticsearch.exceptions.RequestError: RequestError(400, 'parsing_exception', 'request does not support [sort]')`\r\n\r\nwhich basically says the endpoint didn't accept the `sort` parameter from the query\r\n\r\nHence this PR aims to fix the bug and re-enable reading remote logs. With this PR merged, airflow should resume its ability to read remote logs from ES. Local test result: \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/43698890/1b35ed64-6b88-49c5-9530-ed1c1b69c408)\r\n\r\nAdditional implementation details: \r\n\r\nThe changes I made was just to remove the sort parameter in the query to be posted to elasticsearch. \r\n\r\nI inspected the original source code in provider 4.5.1 :\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/providers-elasticsearch/4.5.1/airflow/providers/elasticsearch/log/es_task_handler.py#L290-L294\r\n\r\nWhile the `sort()` method was triggered from `elasticsearch_dsl`, the actual query posted to elasticsearch NEVER includes the sort parameter. So even in `4.5.1` , the result returned is not sorted. The `sort()` method in `4.5.1` just provides a false sense that the returned result is sorted, but it is actually not.\r\n\r\nHere's how the function code gets called:\r\n1. the `count()`  method from `elasticsearch_dsl, class Search` gets called.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/providers-elasticsearch/4.5.1/airflow/providers/elasticsearch/log/es_task_handler.py#L297\r\n\r\n2. Inside the `count()` method, the `to_dict()` method gets called with `count = True`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py/blob/main/elasticsearch_dsl/search.py#L694\r\n\r\n3. In the `to_dict()` method, since `count = True` , the sort parameter didn't get appended\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py/blob/main/elasticsearch_dsl/search.py#L640-L664","created_at":"2023-07-08T07:29:55Z","updated_at":"2023-07-15T06:30:05Z","closed_at":"2023-07-15T06:30:04Z","merged_at":"2023-07-15T06:30:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"41e611929eadcbbc746d956647967c82f40fae4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sunank200","id":8670962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzA5NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8670962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200","html_url":"https://github.com/sunank200","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunank200/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"phanikumv","id":94376113,"node_id":"U_kgDOBaAQsQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94376113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanikumv","html_url":"https://github.com/phanikumv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanikumv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanikumv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanikumv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanikumv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanikumv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanikumv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanikumv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanikumv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.githu

This refactoring can also be applied to the `scheduler_liveness_check_command` and `triggerer_liveness_check_command` if that is requested.\r\nInversely, I can also refactor to comply with the existing if/else duplication of the templates.\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/28799\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR moves the FAB security manager to the FAB auth manager directory. It moves:\r\n- airflow/www/security.py -> airflow/auth/managers/fab/fab_security/airflow_manager.py\r\n- airflow/www/fab_security/manager.py -> airflow/auth/managers/fab/fab_security/base_manager.py\r\n- airflow/www/fab_security/sqla/manager.py -> airflow/auth/managers/fab/fab_security/manager.py\r\n\r\nThe security manager is highly correlated to FAB, thus we want to move it to the FAB auth manager. In future PRs we want to move features which are part of the security manager to the auth manager. It will be done in separate PRs.\r\n\r\nThe only concern/question I have is, users are able to override the security manager through config (see code [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/extensions/init_appbuilder.py#L677)). Therefore, when moving features from security manager to auth manager we might break experience from users who overrode the security manager. Example: my plan was to move the security manager method [register_views](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/fab_security/manager.py#L735) to the FAB auth manager and call the new method [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/extensions/init_appbuilder.py#L343). But if some users overrode this method in their own security manager, the experience will be broken. Any thoughts? Should I check if users overrode the security manager in the new auth manager method `register_views` and if so, execute this method?\r\n\r\ncc @potiuk \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The tests inside `tests` finds the nearest `_clear_db` fixture and continues to use it. We should not use that conftest fixture for helm chart tests. \r\nSo likely then https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/28631 had side-effect of trying to clear db where it was not initialized\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the helm charts tests outside `tests/charts` to `test-charts`. Tested using the steps:\r\n1. Created a new env\r\n2. Ran the command\r\n`pip install -e .\"[devel]\" --constraint https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-main/constraints-source-providers-3.8.txt `\r\n4. Ran the tests in test-charts and we are good :+1:!

This allows DAG run conf to be correctly rendered in the grid view, but the fix was not applied to the list view, hence breaking `/dagrun/list` if there are conf values that are not JSON serializable.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to address the incompleteness of the previous fix by using `WebEncoder` in `formatters_columns`, which should allow non-JSON-serializable conf to be rendered in list view in the same way it is rendered in grid view.\r\n\r\nNote that `www.utils.json_f` is used exactly once where the code change happened, and the code change seems trivial, so I am not sure if unit tests or other forms of validation is warranted, but I am happy to write tests if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering my contribution!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR fixes the following case.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to copy `source/foo.txt` to `dest/foo.txt` within a single GCS bucket.\r\n1. Create a GCS bucket and upload two files to source directory like this:\r\n```\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt.abc\r\n```\r\n2. Upload the following DAG to a Cloud Composer environment:\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.providers.google.cloud.transfers.gcs_to_gcs import GCSToGCSOperator\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"gcs_to_gcs_fail_example\",\r\n    schedule_interval=None,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    start_date=datetime(2021,1,1)\r\n) as dag:\r\n    copy_file = GCSToGCSOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"copy_file\",\r\n        source_bucket=\"my-bucket\",\r\n        source_object=\"source/foo.txt\",\r\n        destination_object=\"dest/foo.txt\",\r\n        exact_match=True,\r\n    )\r\n    copy_file\r\n```\r\n3. Run the DAG\r\n\r\n**Expected bucket state:**\r\n```\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt.abc\r\ngs://my-bucket/dest/foo.txt\r\n```\r\n**Actual (incorrect) bucket state:**\r\n```\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt.abc\r\ngs://my-bucket/dest/foo.txt/source/foo.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nThe reason for this bug was the lack of handling `exact_match=True` when objects are being copied without a wildcard. This problem is fixed in the current PR.\r\n\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nHowever, if the flag is set to its default value `exact_match=False`, then the operator's result is different:\r\n```\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt.abc\r\ngs://my-bucket/dest/foo.txt/source/foo.txt\r\ngs://my-bucket/dest/foo.txt/source/foo.txt.abc\r\n```\r\nIt's actually correct, because in general `source_object=\"path/to/the/file.txt\"` is not treated as a file path, but as an object name **prefix** ([doc](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/samples/storage-list-files-with-prefix)). That's why the **prefix** `source_object=\"path/to/the/file.txt\"` corresponds to both objects:\r\n```\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt\r\ngs://my-bucket/source/foo.txt.abc\r\n```\r\nAnd if the destination_object is set, then the destination object prefix is just built as a concatenation of the source prefix and the destination prefix. There is no difference for GCS what is being copied: a file or a folder - both of these entities are the same things - objects.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, it makes sense to implement more \"human friendly\" logic, so the operator would act with inputs as with files and folders, but I think it should be another operator, because `GCSToGCSOperator`'s current implementation became too complicated for major changes. This is just my thoughts, I'm not insisting.","created_at":"2023-07-05T14:22:31Z","updated_at":"2023-07-06T08:00:20Z","closed_at":"2023-07-06T08:00:20Z","merged_at":"2023-07-06T08:00:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4757d6dfa6e7385eb90c38c60ab8fefa24e7a0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

PR fixes https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/29258\r\n\r\nThe problem was caused by multiple processes updating metadata of the Compute Engine instance when running in parallel: methods _authorize_compute_engine_instance_metadata() and import_ssh_public_key() are used to upload metadata and import ssh keys. Both of them included making API requests to update information inside the instance. When making such requests in parallel all the processes were updating the same data simultaneously, that caused those problems listed in the issue.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to use some kind of lock to prevent execution of critical part of the code by several processes at one time. As the Composer is a distributed system, all the processes are running separately, making connection between them hard.\r\nAs the solution in this case i have implemented a logic of creation separate GCS bucket that will hold a file that will be used as a lock for the processes: if the file exists and there is a string inside it - the lock is acquired. After the execution is finished, the lock will be released, so next process could take this lock next. The last process running will delete the bucket.\r\n\r\nNote: when establishing connection using os_login, make sure that you have enabled such option for your instance in instance keys and that all of the connections you are trying to establish use the same value for the parameter: once you have enabled os_login for your instance, it will wait the exact type of keys to authenticate correctly. There is no option to mix different types of authentication for one instance.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

you must instantiate a classic operator or call a decorated operator inside the context manager before it will link up with the context manager. For example, tasks 1 and 2 below will be outside the group1 context:\r\n```\r\n   task1 = BashOperator(task_id=\"task1\", bash_command=\"echo task1\")\r\n   task2 = BashOperator(task_id=\"task2\", bash_command=\"echo task2\")\r\n   with TaskGroup('group1'):\r\n        task1 >> task2\r\n```\r\nThis PR addresses the above such that when you do that, the tasks will be inside the group1 context.\r\nFor a single task, you can do:\r\n```\r\n   task1 = BashOperator(task_id=\"task1\", bash_command=\"echo task1\")\r\n   with TaskGroup('group1') as scope:\r\n

you need to pass `runtime_parameters` argument to explicitly set e.g. search_path in PostgresOperator.\r\nThe solution IMO is not that good. It introduces use of `psycopg2.SQL` which is not compatible with `sql` attribute type.\r\nMoreover, it overcomplicates things, does not maintain same session variables outside of `PostgresOperator` execution and would be problematic to implement when removing `PostgresOperator` which is marked as deprecated class.\r\n\r\nAdditional motivation is that I'd like to use `PostgresOperator`'s hook after it's execution but with the same session params in OpenLineage integration. This PR allows to do this easily.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

is a follow-up on #18616 where we introduced retries on the occassional deadlocks when rendered task fields have been deleted by parallel threads (this is not a real deadlock, it's because MySQL locks too many things when queries are executed and will deadlock when one of those queries wait too much).\r\n\r\nAdding retry - while not perfect - should allow to handle the problem and significantly decrease the likelihood of such deadlocks.\r\n\r\nWe can probably think about different approach for rendered fields, but for now retrying is - I think - acceptable short-term fix.\r\n\r\nFixes:

We would then use this file in the Kubernetes client. The get-credentials command configures kubectl to automatically refresh its credentials using the same identity as gcloud.\r\n\r\nHowever, the #29266 introduced a new pod GKE hook that uses the following client code:\r\n```python\r\nApiClient(\r\n    configuration,\r\n    header_name=\"Authorization\",\r\n    header_value=f\"Bearer {access_token}\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis client uses static oauth2 credentials and cannot refresh them when they expire. Since the default lifetime for GCP credentials is 3600 seconds, the operator fails with an Unauthorized exception after one hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

This PR follows the [discussion started here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/32058#discussioncomment-6263179).\r\n\r\n\r\nA good place to implement the transformation of Row into tuples is after the execution of the handler, in the [`run()`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/common/sql/hooks/sql.py#L355) method. There, the raw data structure is available. Doing it later would imply to deal with potential nested structure (ex: list of results).\r\n\r\nThus, I propose to add method in the DBApiHook to make the result of a query serializable. So that subclasses can override it to implement their own logic.\r\n\r\nI see that many Hooks based on `DbApiHook` have a custom run method. But considering @potiuk comment about \"[the most standard the better](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/32058#discussioncomment-6263179)\", I propose to go for an extra internal method that Hooks can override, rather than copying the full run() method just to implement a small change. Considering also that the pyodbc.Row may not be the only case where a custom object causes issues ([Databricks could be rewrote to handle that issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31780/files) at Hook level). And considering that this pattern already exists with the [`serialize_cell`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/common/sql/hooks/sql.py#L478) method which get overidden by child hooks.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)**
