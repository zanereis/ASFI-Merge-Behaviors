I pushed the nulls to the top because I think it might be more useful for people who are investigating why a DAG is not being triggered by a dataset, so it might be more helpful to have datasets that have never been updated as easily accessible as possible.

we moved the \"compile-www-assets\" to host (and deferred it to pre-commit to prepare and manage appropriate node virtualenv), starting airflow via `start-airflow` command had become slower, adding quite a few seconds always when you run the command. Also it was a bit convoluted to start dev mode - you had to stop and restart webserver and run dev asset recompilation.\r\n\r\nThis change improves the `start-airflow` experience in several ways:\r\n\r\n* the compile-www-assets pre-commit in start airflow runs in a background, daemon thread. This allows start-airflow command to continue even if asset compilation takes quite some time. By the time webserver starts and database initializes and the user launches browser it should be completed anyway.\r\n* the assets are not recompiled if none of the \"www\" files changed which for most people who run airflow without modifying the UI part will make it really fast to re-run start-airflow\r\n* we have a new flag --skip-assets-compilation added that will skip asset compilation even if the www files were modified\r\n* finally we have a new \"--dev-mode\" when starting airflow that will run the \"dev\" mode of assets compilation. And thanks to the background, daemon thread, assets compilation in dev mode will continue running as long as the `start-airflow` command is running\r\n\r\nAll this should naturally plug in the exisitng start-airflow usage and add new capabilities for those who develop UI (you can run dev mode now without manually restarting anything).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

are installing Providers on Airflow 2.2 version and this installation on CI takes 29 minutes. This is super long. It turns out that vast mahjority of that time is PIP resolver trying to do backracking based on the requirements new providers have.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly google dependencies and `pip` downloading and trying many versions of the dependencies. However, we can make use of our 2.2 constraints to lower-bound the dependencies used by the resolver - simply by changing the 2.2 constraints into lower bounds (this is extremely unlikely new airflow will have lower version of any dependency that 2.2 had).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#26273\r\n\r\nThis change allows you to dump `dict` type objects returned from a database to a string.
