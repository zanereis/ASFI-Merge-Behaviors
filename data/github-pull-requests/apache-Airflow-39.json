a possibility to run tests in \"DB isolation\" mode.\r\n\r\nSuch tests will require an internal-api component to be running alongside the tests and some specific configuration that will be shared via environment variables.\r\n\r\nThis one adds support for breeze testing tests command and for the interactive breeze shell command.\r\n\r\nIt already works for most tests in dag_processor - with few caveats to fix.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet wired to the CI but it should be a very easy special test case to add - once we get the tests \"green\".\r\n\r\nThe gist of it is to make sure that when the\r\n`RUN_TESTS_WITH_DATABASE_ISOLATION` environment variable is set to `true`, there is a special TracebackSesssionForTests created that will allow test code to run DB operations (setip/teardown and initialization in tests while it will not allow \"airflow\" code to create a DB session (it will raise exception) and all the airflow code should use internal_api in this case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n

are a few fixes to the internal API error handling that caused errors when handling permission errors. The internal API now handles only application/json content type and only requests that explicitly accept only application/json responses - which is an extra layer of security that makes CSRF protection not necessary (though our token validation should already prevent CSRF issues.\r\n\r\nThe Permission Denied exceptions did not like the exc_info parameter, so it has been removed. Also in case of auth_manager not initialized we should return a very generic error message as this is only in case of standalone internal_api component.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38674, https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39585 and https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39912, we introduce `start_from_trigger` and `start_trigger_args` to allow OP author/ DAG author to run task directly from triggerer without going into worker. However, the limitation is that all the kwargs passed to the trigger_cls need to be serializable.

Those have been refactored and exposed as internal API calls.\r\n\r\nA bug was fixed in scheduler_job_runner that caused using of next_event before it has been declared (which occured when standalone dag processor is used and db isolation mode.\r\n\r\nThe DB retry will now correctly use logger when it is used as decorator on class method.\r\n\r\nThe \"main\" code that removes DB connection from configuration (mostly in case of Breeze) when untrusted components are used has been improved to handle the case where DAGFile Processor forks parsing subprocesses.\r\n\r\nTmux configuration got improved so that both non-isolation and isolation mode distribute panels better.\r\n\r\nSimplified InternalApiConfig - \"main\" directly sets db/internal use in db_isolation mode depending on the component.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR fixes XCOM_sidecar_container not started results in long running DAG \r\nCloses: #38115 \r\n \r\nThe following operators are affected:\r\n- KubernetesPodOperator\r\n\r\nAlthough `startup_timeout_seconds` is the timeout for the pod start, there is no parameter to set the timeout for the sidecar container in `KubernetesPodOperator`. Therefore, I have used `startup_timeout_seconds` for xcom sidecar container too.\r\n\r\nInstead of above approach, I have also considered the following alternatives:\r\n- Adding a new parameter to KubernetesPodOperator to set the timeout for the XCOM container.\r\n- Raising an Exception if `attempt > 1` instead of using a timeout.\r\n\r\nIf you have any better suggestions, please let me know.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

order to leverage the AIP-44 interface for AIP-69 / Remote Executor I need some small adjustments to \"hook into\" the RPC API. This PR extracts from PoC implementation of AIP-69 (#40900) the needed internal API adjustments:\r\n\r\n- The private cached method map `_initialize_map()` needs to be extended, not to replicate the function list I'd like to remove the private tag to extend it with a few methods in remote executor. Would not add it to be a \"public\" interface though.\r\n- Allowing to use a different API path from the standard internal API URL. For the remote case we would expose the URL to another (plugin hosted or separately operated) path, such a URL with path should be configurable as API endpoint\r\n- For the setup of the CLI for Remote worker a way to force usage of internal API as in the remote case we would configure other config.\r\n- Allow the (Remote Provider Package) to hook-in additional classes for serialization to Pydantic

PR is a DRAFT to further get to a MVP release of AIP-69. DO NOT MERGE (yet) - but please feedback on it if you like.\r\n\r\nIt is a continuation of PR #40224 which was a kind of PoC and step-by-step more stuff came onto this on top.\r\n\r\nThis is a kind of \"Mothership\" PR where all contributions are collected. Small parts will be separately opened as PR to get on main and finally I'd split this PR up into smaller pieces for easier review. In this PR all parts and work is collected.\r\n\r\nPlease treat this as experimental as noted in the docs, it is not expected to be rock-solid but a first usable version. It can be used to distribute the first task. Status of implementation is tracked in `docs/apache-airflow-providers-edge/edge_executor.rst` below headline \"Feature Backlog of MVP to Release Readiness\" in this PR.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test it you can:\r\n- Checkout the branch\r\n- Run `breeze start-airflow --load-example-dags --backend postgres --executor EdgeExecutor`\r\n- The Edge Worker will be start in one panel by breeze\r\n- A task can be run, e.g. use example DAG `example_python_operator` or the `Integration Test` with a bit more complexity (this integration test has been moved to `providers/src/airflow/providers/edge/example_dags/integration_test.py`). Wohoo! \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/c0e148d7-8712-43d4-b927-958d1fd578ad)\r\n- If you open the UI you will see an additional plugin loaded in the menu \"Admin\" -> \"Remote Worker Status\": \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/a7a6ae19-f962-44db-a8c7-cf913a7edbeb)\r\n\r\nBased on progress and time I will sometimes re-base and push changes to this branch. But it will not be something that will be review-able.\r\nI will not add any migration logic in case of updates for the additional tables in DB Scheme. If I update the draft PR and DB schema changes, DB might need to be reset. Of course migration support would need to be added before a \"real\" release.","created_at":"2024-07-20T12:19:39Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T07:06:28Z","closed_at":"2024-10-18T07:06:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b934108a5b8ab5e3e438aeb6415a6ca82a8662f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"shahar1","id":60007259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDA3MjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60007259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1","html_url":"https://github.com/shahar1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shahar1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5924660364,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABYSMkjA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Executors-core","name":"area:Executors-core","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"LocalExecutor

this PR, it is possible to get a working \"DB isolation\" working solution with celery executor. From my tests it works comparably fast to the non-DB isolation executor.\r\n\r\nThings changed here:\r\n\r\n* remove \"schedule_downstream_tasks\" endpoint. It is currently not possible to get it as DAG object is removed during serialization and this is where this method calculates which tasks to schedule\r\n\r\n* when we are forcing DB access in DB isolation mode, we print log message that we are switching to using DB for appropriate components. We also make sure to remove DB configuration just in case it is set (this allows to run tests in breeze environment with more certainty)\r\n\r\n* the detection whether to force direct DB access is made in _main - this way regular commands run in breeze (migrate/user etc. can use the DB while intializing the environment and actions can be logged to DB or via RPC calls.\r\n\r\n* improved diagnostics\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

based on a real world issue seen in production where a failing pod does not make the associated task fail\r\n\r\nRunning theory: then a pod fails while in `self.pod_manager.fetch_container_logs`, `running` property of the returned `pod_log_status` object is False, hence we skip the deferrable call and jump directly to `self._clean`\r\nBut the issue is that the `event` object is never refreshed and still carries the `running` status, hence hitting this code path:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4cbfcd72a27086485682a93ed7be8ef75ecfde88/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/operators/pod.py#L793-L794\r\n\r\nand making the task instance returns without error\r\n\r\nProposed fix: call defer whatever the pod status is after fetching logs, so that the fail status is picked up during the next trigger run\r\nIt adds a bit of delay to the pod completion detection but is simple/stupid :) \r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow

default the DB is cleared from all items before running tests. This is needed for many different reasons but in some cases we might want to disable that. One of the example is running multiple tests in parallel against a same DB (e.g. running different system tests in parallel against a same DB). In that case, we need to disable it because each test is conflicting with each other (one test is going to delete the resources the other test is creating and need).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

anticipation of Dataset Aliases, the Datasets page is getting a refresh. What really matters are events, so this update allows us to emphasize Dataset Events and sets us up to show more event details in the future.\r\n\r\nMost notably,\r\n- add a Dataset Events list to show all dataset events across all datasets\r\n- the dataset events was changed from a table to a list of cards with more richly displayed information (source, downstream runs, extra)\r\n- show dataset events, details, datasets list and the graph in separate tabs vs trying to squeeze everything into one view\r\n- new breadcrumb to show if a dataset is selected (later on we will allow users to select dataset events)\r\n- Richer dataset details (extra, consuming dags, producing tasks)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1080\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-23 at 1 59 19 PM\"

is another PR as improvement for internal API in relation to implementation of AIP-69 in PoC PR #40224 - I relaized that BashOperator also has a DB access to update template fields.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds one AIP endpoint to un-bundle the Operator from the DB.\r\n\r\nNote: I am aware that a similar endpoint was added with airflow/models/taskinstance.py:_update_rtif() but thepurpose it slightly different. Hard to consolidate w/o the need to have more calls over the API. Therefore I propose to add a new one here.\r\n\r\nWith this actually the [Integration test](https://github.com/jscheffl/airflow/blob/feature/aip-69-poc/airflow/example_dags/integration_test.py) in my AIP-69 is completely working with all basic features!
