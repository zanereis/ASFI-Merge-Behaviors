What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we can extract `millennium/century/decade/year/quarter/month/week/day/hour/minute/second(with fractions)//millisecond/microseconds` and `epoch` from interval values\r\n\r\nWhile getting the `millennium/century/decade/year`, it means how many the interval `months` part can be converted to that unit-value. The content of `millennium/century/decade` will overlap `year` and each other.\r\n\r\nWhile getting `month/day` and so on, it means the integral remainder of the previous unit. Here all the units including `year` are individual.\r\n\r\nSo while extracting `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, which are ANSI primary datetime units, the semantic is `extracting`, but others might refer to `transforming`.\r\n\r\nWhile getting epoch we have treat month as 30 days which varies the natural Calendar rules we use.\r\n\r\nTo avoid ambiguity, I suggest we should only support those extract field defined ANSI with their abbreviations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExtracting `millennium`, `century` etc does not obey the meaning of extracting, and they are not so useful and worth maintaining.\r\n\r\nThe `extract` is ANSI standard expression and `date_part` is its pg-specific alias function. The current support extract-fields are fully bought from PostgreSQL. \r\n\r\nWith a look at other systems like Presto/Hive, they don't support those ambiguous fields too.\r\n\r\ne.g. Hive 2.2.x also take it from PostgreSQL but without introducing those ambiguous fields https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12828349/HIVE-14579\r\n\r\ne.g. presto\r\n\r\n```sql\r\npresto> select extract(quater from interval '10-0' year to month);\r\nQuery 20200417_094723_00020_m8xq4 failed: line 1:8: Invalid EXTRACT field: quater\r\nselect extract(quater from interval '10-0' year to month)\r\n\r\npresto> select extract(decade from interval '10-0' year to month);\r\nQuery 20200417_094737_00021_m8xq4 failed: line 1:8: Invalid EXTRACT field: decade\r\nselect extract(decade from interval '10-0' year to month)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, as we already have previews versions, this PR will remove support for extracting `millennium/century/decade/quarter/week/millisecond/microseconds` and `epoch` from intervals with `date_part` function\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR (SPARK-31462) fixes the usage of getopts and case statement in `do-release.sh` and `do-release-docker.sh`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current master, do-release.sh contains the following code.\r\n```\r\nwhile getopts \"bn\" opt; do\r\n  case $opt in\r\n    b) GIT_BRANCH=$OPTARG ;;\r\n    n) DRY_RUN=1 ;;\r\n    ?) error \"Invalid option: $OPTARG\" ;;\r\n  esac\r\ndone\r\n```\r\nThere are 3 wrong usage in getopts and case statement.\r\n1. To set  $OPTARG to an argument passed for the option \"b\", the parameter for getopts should be \"b:\".\r\n2. To set $OPTARG to the invalid option name passed, the parameter for getopts starts with \":\".\r\n3. It's minor but to match the character \"?\", it's better to escape like \"\\\\?\".\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI checked that $GIT_BRANCH is set when do-release.sh is launched with -b option.\r\nI also checked that the error message contains invalid option name when do-release.sh is launched with an invalid option.","created_at":"2020-04-16T18:04:16Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T04:09:28Z","closed_at":"2020-04-16T19:54:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"251618fc69d83f593188b6083accc22ffbd19611","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea053bc9810bf23d3a333e1a4a4e68249071f79e","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-do-release","ref":"fix-do-release","sha":"ea053bc9810bf23d3a333e1a4a4e68249071f79e","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen using the insert overwrite directory syntax, if the target path is an existing file, the final operation result is incorrect.\r\nAt present, Spark will not delete the existing files. After the calculation is completed, one of the result files will be renamed to the result path.\r\nThis is different from hive's behavior. Hive will delete the existing target file.\r\nAfter the repair, it will determine whether the target path is an existing file, and if so, delete the file first.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBe consistent with hive's behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdding an optimized K-Means implementation based on DenseMatrix and GEMM to improve performance. JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31454. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe main computations in K-Means are calculating distances between individual points and center points. Currently K-Means implementation is vector-based which can't take advantage of optimized native BLAS libraries.\r\n\r\nWhen the original points are represented as dense vectors, our approach is to modify the original input data structures to a DenseMatrix-based one by grouping several points together. The original distance calculations can be translated into a Matrix multiplication then optimized native GEMM routines (Intel MKL, OpenBLAS etc.) can be used. This approach can also work with sparse vectors despite having larger memory consumption when translating sparse vectors to dense matrix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. Use config parameters to control if turn on this implementation without modifying public interfaces.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUse the same dataset and parameters to run original K-Means and this implementation and compare the results.","created_at":"2020-04-16T03:21:27Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T09:59:57Z","closed_at":"2020-09-10T00:41:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7151decd9860e05e22923f0b9267593a7acaa220","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR excludes `ui` directly and `UI.scala` configuration file in `CORE` label, and exclude `dev/.rat-excludes` in `BUILD` label  in autolabeller. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28218, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28217, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28214 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28213\r\n\r\nThere are some contexts about this https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28114.\r\n\r\nThe syntax is from https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format (see also https://github.com/kaelzhang/node-ignore)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo label UI component properly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt uses the same syntax used for other places. I expect to see the actual results after it gets merged as it's difficult to test it out.","created_at":"2020-04-16T00:47:16Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:51Z","closed_at":"2020-04-16T01:17:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f70e67fd075682face125d0daeee538dc12d3e8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28228/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28228/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28228/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6e033d9c0824678047491d826d1818799b77c67","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-31330-followup","ref":"SPARK-31330-followup","sha":"e6e033d9c0824678047491d826d1818799b77c67","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change rebasing of not-existed timestamps in the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian since 1582-10-15) in the range [1582-10-05, 1582-10-15). Not existed timestamps from the range are shifted to the first valid date in the hybrid calendar - 1582-10-15. The changes affect only `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` because reverse rebasing from the hybrid timestamps to Proleptic Gregorian timestamps does not have such problem.\r\n\r\nThe shifting affects only the date part of timestamps while keeping the time part as is. For example:\r\n```\r\n1582-10-10 00:11:22.334455 -> 1582-10-15 00:11:22.334455\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, not-existed timestamps are shifted by standard difference between Julian and Gregorian calendar on 1582-10-04, for example 1582-10-14 00:00:00 -> 1582-10-24 00:00:00. That contradicts to shifting of not existed dates in other cases, for example:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"select timestamp'1990-9-31 12:12:12'\").show\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n|TIMESTAMP('1990-10-01 12:12:12.0')|\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n|               1990-10-01 12:12:12|\r\n+----------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, this impacts on conversion of Spark SQL `TIMESTAMP` values to external timestamps based on non-Proleptic Gregorian calendar. For example, while saving the 1582-10-14 12:13:14 date to ORC files, it will be shifted to the next valid date 1582-10-15 12:13:14.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` and to `OrcSourceSuite`\r\n- By existing test suites `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite`, `CollectionExpressionsSuite`, `ParquetIOSuite`.","created_at":"2020-04-15T19:22:18Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:47:53Z","closed_at":"2020-04-16T02:54:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1372f8f8050b3f3742851d81bf77a30740ead608","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28227/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28227/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28227/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/736eaa6c3ad4795309d0c3ed07180111a9f9e7a7","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-not-exist-timestamps","ref":"fix-not-exist-timestamps","sha":"736eaa6c3ad4795309d0c3ed07180111a9f9e7a7","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change rebasing of not-existed dates in the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian since 1582-10-15) in the range (1582-10-04, 1582-10-15). Not existed dates from the range are shifted to the first valid date in the hybrid calendar - 1582-10-15. The changes affect only `rebaseGregorianToJulianDays()` because reverse rebasing from the hybrid dates to Proleptic Gregorian dates does not have such problem.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, not-existed dates are shifted by standard difference between Julian and Gregorian calendar on 1582-10-04, for example 1582-10-14 -> 1582-10-24. That contradicts to shifting not existed dates in other cases, for example:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"select date'1990-9-31'\").show\r\n+-----------------+\r\n|DATE '1990-10-01'|\r\n+-----------------+\r\n|       1990-10-01|\r\n+-----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, this impacts on conversion of Spark SQL `DATE` values to external dates based on non-Proleptic Gregorian calendar. For example, while saving the 1582-10-14 date to ORC files, it will be shifted to the next valid date 1582-10-15.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` and to `OrcSourceSuite`\r\n- By existing test suites `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite`, `CollectionExpressionsSuite`,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR moves the `ExpressionEncoder.toRow` and `ExpressionEncoder.fromRow` functions into their own function objects(`ExpressionEncoder.Serializer` & `ExpressionEncoder.Deserializer`). This effectively makes the `ExpressionEncoder` stateless, thread-safe and (more) reusable. The function objects are not thread safe, however they are documented as such and should be used in a more limited scope (making it easier to reason about thread safety).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExpressionEncoders are not thread-safe. We had various (nasty) bugs because of this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2020-04-15T09:04:00Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T03:19:50Z","closed_at":"2020-04-17T01:48:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d6f0b1145cd2a2689c32f643970e68cb487a711","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n#### ExtractIntervalPart change\r\n`ExtractIntervalPart` expression get the interval parts information from `CalendarInterval`, which has three fields months, days and microseconds.\r\n\r\nTo get days interval `ExtractIntervalDays` expression simply returns the days field of provided `CalendarInterval` input. \r\n\r\nIf input is `CalendarInterval(months=2, days=10, microseconds=0)`, it returns output as 10, but instead it should return total days in the interval. In this it has to return as 70 days.\r\n\r\n#### CalendarInterval change\r\nAnother change I am proposing is equality comparision between two CalendarInterval object. \r\nRight now, `CalendarInterval(months=1, days=0, microseconds=0)` and `CalendarInterval(months=0, days=30, microseconds=0)` are not equal. \r\n\r\nI understand a month could have 30 or 31 days, but there should be way to compare two intervals even if they have different values in three fields but if both have same epoch it should be considered as equal\r\n\r\nChange to equals method in `CalendarInterval` is not required to fix the issue in `ExtractIntervalPart`, but I feel we should fix how two CalendarInterval objects are compared in equals method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBelow sql statement return output as 0 instead of 14 days \r\n`SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM (cast('2020-01-15 00:00:00' as timestamp) - cast('2020-01-01 00:00:00' as timestamp)))`\r\n\r\nBelow is why it returns wrong output\r\n\r\n`val start = Instant.parse(\"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z\")`\r\n`val end = Instant.parse(\"2019-01-15T00:00:00.000000Z\")`\r\n\r\n`SubtractTimestamps(Literal(end), Literal(start))` expression returns `CalendarInterval(months=0, days=0, microseconds=1209600000)`\r\n\r\nSo, when evaluating below expression `ExtractIntervalDays` returns the value in days field in interval, which is zero, but correct answer is 14 days\r\n`ExtractIntervalDays(SubtractTimestamps(Literal(end), Literal(start)))`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, previously we will face an error above, but after this PR, we will see the result:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"select 1 v, 1 v\").toPandas()\r\n   v  v\r\n0  1  1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded and modified related

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen `toPandas` API works on duplicate column names produced from operators like join, we see the error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.bool(), a.item(), a.any() or a.all().\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the error in `toPandas` API.  \r\n\r\nThis is the backport of original patch to branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo make `toPandas` work on dataframe with duplicate column names.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Previously calling `toPandas` API on a dataframe with duplicate column names will fail. After this patch, it will produce correct result.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change explicitly set locale of timeline view to 'en' to be the same appearance as before upgrading vis-timeline. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe upgraded vis-timeline in #28192 and the upgraded version is different from before we used in the notation of dates.\r\nThe notation seems to be dependent on locale. The following is appearance in my Japanese environment.\r\n<img width=\"557\" alt=\"locale-changed\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/79265314-de886700-7ed0-11ea-8641-fa76b993c0d9.png\">\r\n\r\nAlthough the notation is in Japanese, the default format is a little bit unnatural (e.g. 4月9日 05:39 is natural rather than 9 四月 05:39).\r\n\r\nI found we can get the same appearance as before by explicitly set locale to 'en'.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI visited JobsPage, JobPage and StagePage and confirm that timeline view shows dates with 'en' locale.\r\n<img width=\"735\"

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR makes each id attribute for page navigations in a page unique.\r\n\r\n`PagedTable#pageNavigation` returns HTML elements representing a page navigation for a paged table.\r\nIn the current implementation, the method generates an id and it's used for id attribute for a set of elements for the page navigation.\r\nBut some pages have two page navigations so there are two set of elements where corresponding elements have the same id.\r\nFor example, there are two `form-completedJob-table-page` id in JobsPage.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nEach id attribute should be unique in a page.\r\nThe following is a screenshot of warning messages shown with Chrome when I visit JobsPage (Firefox doesn't show in my environment).\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"warning-jobspage\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/79261523-f3fa9280-7eca-11ea-861d-d54f04f1b0bc.png\">\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI added a test case for `pageNavigation` extended.\r\nI also manually tested that there were no warning messages for the uniqueness in JobsPage and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen loading DataFrames from JDBC datasource with Kerberos authentication, remote executors (yarn-client/cluster etc. modes) fail to establish a connection due to lack of Kerberos ticket or ability to generate it.\r\n\r\nThis is a real issue when trying to ingest data from kerberized data sources (SQL Server, Oracle) in enterprise environment where exposing simple authentication access is not an option due to IT policy issues.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've added DB2 support (other supported databases will come in later PRs).\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains:\r\n* Added `DB2ConnectionProvider`\r\n* Added `DB2ConnectionProviderSuite`\r\n* Added `DB2KrbIntegrationSuite` docker integration test\r\n* Changed DB2 JDBC driver to use the latest (test scope only)\r\n* Changed test table data type to a type which is supported by all the databases\r\n* Removed double connection creation on test side\r\n* Increased connection timeout in docker tests because DB2 docker takes quite a time to start\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMissing JDBC kerberos support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, now user is able to connect to DB2 using kerberos.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Additional + existing unit tests\r\n* Additional + existing integration tests\r\n* Test on cluster manually\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-14T13:34:08Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:00:23Z","closed_at":"2020-04-23T00:10:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9e21d201a629872fb8efec571a44e1687ccf0cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28215/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28215/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28215/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ecacec136af8a1c3a439ce7b71ff9f6c3abb626","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-31272","ref":"SPARK-31272","sha":"1ecacec136af8a1c3a439ce7b71ff9f6c3abb626","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOptimise the `toJavaDate()` method of `DateTimeUtils` by:\r\n1. Re-using `rebaseGregorianToJulianDays` optimised by #28067\r\n2. Creating `java.sql.Date` instances from milliseconds in UTC since the epoch instead of date-time fields. This allows to avoid \"normalization\" inside of  `java.sql.Date`.\r\n\r\nAlso new benchmark for collecting dates is added to `DateTimeBenchmark`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the performance regression of collecting `DATE` values comparing to Spark 2.4 (see `DateTimeBenchmark` in https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark/pull/27):\r\n\r\nSpark 2.4.6-SNAPSHOT:\r\n```\r\nTo/from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSQL Rest API exposes query execution metrics as Public API. This PR aims to apply following improvements on SQL Rest API by aligning Spark-UI.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Improvements:**\r\n1- Support Physical Operations and group metrics per physical operation by aligning Spark UI.\r\n2- Support `wholeStageCodegenId` for Physical Operations\r\n3- `nodeId` can be useful for grouping metrics and sorting physical operations (according to execution order) to differentiate same operators (if used multiple times during the same query execution) and their metrics.\r\n4- Filter `empty` metrics by aligning with Spark UI - SQL Tab. Currently, Spark UI does not show empty metrics.\r\n5- Remove line breakers(`\\n`) from `metricValue`.\r\n6- `planDescription` can be `optional` Http parameter to avoid network cost where there is specially complex jobs creating big-plans.\r\n7- `metrics` attribute needs to be exposed at the bottom order as `nodes`. Specially, this can be useful for the user where `nodes` array size is high. \r\n8- `edges` attribute is being exposed to show relationship between `nodes`. \r\n9- Reverse order on `metricDetails` aims to match with Spark UI by supporting Physical Operators' execution order.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProposed improvements provides more useful (e.g: physical operations and metrics correlation, grouping) and clear (e.g: filtering blank metrics, removing line breakers) result for the end-user.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Please find both current and improved versions of the results as attached for following SQL Rest Endpoint:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET http://localhost:4040/api/v1/applications/$appId/sql/$executionId?details=true\r\n```\r\n**Current version:**\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12999821/current_version.json\r\n\r\n**Improved version:**\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13000621/improved_version.json\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatibility\r\nSQL Rest API will be started to expose with `Spark 3.0` and `3.0.0-preview2` (released on 12/23/19) does not cover this API so if PR can catch 3.0 release, this will not have any backward compatibility issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. New Unit tests are added.\r\n2. Also, patch has been tested manually through both **Spark Core** and **History Server** Rest APIs.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-13T20:51:00Z","updated_at":"2020-05-20T04:20:52Z","closed_at":"2020-05-19T06:21:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"816b2fdc5ceea7fcd1dc787dedade8e250deb021","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to re-use optimized implementation of days rebase function `rebaseJulianToGregorianDays()` introduced by the PR #28067 in conversion of `java.sql.Date` values to Catalyst's `DATE` values. The function `fromJavaDate` in `DateTimeUtils` was re-written by taking the implementation from Spark 2.4, and by rebasing the final results via `rebaseJulianToGregorianDays()`.\r\n\r\nAlso I updated `DateTimeBenchmark`, and added a benchmark for conversion from `java.sql.Date`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe PR fixes the regression of parallelizing a collection of `java.sql.Date` values, and improves performance of converting external values to Catalyst's `DATE` values:\r\n- x4 on the master branch\r\n- 30% against Spark 2.4.6-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\nSpark

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake `UnsafeKVExternalSorter` / `VariableLengthRowBasedKeyValueBatch ` also respect `UnsafeAlignedOffset` when reading the record and update some out of date comemnts.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince `BytesToBytesMap` respects `UnsafeAlignedOffset` when writing the record, `UnsafeKVExternalSorter` should also respect `UnsafeAlignedOffset` when reading the record from `BytesToBytesMap` otherwise it will causes data correctness issue.\r\n\r\nUnlike `UnsafeKVExternalSorter` may reading records from `BytesToBytesMap`, `VariableLengthRowBasedKeyValueBatch` writes and reads records by itself. Thus, similar to #22053 and [comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22053#issuecomment-411975239) there, fix for `VariableLengthRowBasedKeyValueBatch` more likely an improvement for the support of SPARC platform.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nManually tested `HashAggregationQueryWithControlledFallbackSuite` with `UAO_SIZE=8`  to simulate SPARC platform. And tests only pass with this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAlthough SPARK-30184 Implement a helper method for aliasing functions, developers always forget to using this improvement.\r\nWe need to add more powerful guarantees so that aliases outputed by built-in functions are correct.\r\nThis PR extracts the SQL from the example of expressions, and output the SQL and its schema into one golden file.\r\nBy checking the golden file, we can find the expressions whose aliases are not displayed correctly, and then fix them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnsure that the output alias is correct\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nLike https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28092, this PR is to rename `QueryPlan.collectInPlanAndSubqueries` in AdaptiveSparkPlanHelper to `collectWithSubqueries`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe old name is too verbose. `QueryPlan` is internal but it's the core of catalyst and we'd better make the API name clearer before we release it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A","created_at":"2020-04-12T01:13:23Z","updated_at":"2020-04-12T20:11:58Z","closed_at":"2020-04-12T20:11:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55d0c606c1f6d70f0d4935c726fea8e2a4504d21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d8a7c68cc0b929eba07abce448364032c3c438ef","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:spark-31322","ref":"spark-31322","sha":"d8a7c68cc0b929eba07abce448364032c3c438ef","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed infinite redrawing doesn't happen with a JobPage which I had reproduced the issue.\r\n\r\nWith the original version of vis.js, I reproduced the issue with the following conditions.\r\n\r\n* Use history server and load core/src/test/resources/spark-events.\r\n* Visit the JobPage for job2 in application_1553914137147_0018.\r\n* Zoom out to 80% on Safari / Chrome / Firefox.\r\n\r\nMaybe, it depends on OS and the version of browsers.","created_at":"2020-04-11T21:37:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T14:46:46Z","closed_at":"2020-04-14T06:23:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7f5f67b108d6e644d1016ef05d89d08889f93bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed infinite redrawing doesn't happen with a JobPage which I had reproduced the issue.\r\n\r\nWith the original version of vis.js, I reproduced the issue with the following conditions.\r\n\r\n* Use history server and load `core/src/test/resources/spark-events`.\r\n* Visit the JobPage for job2 in application_1553914137147_0018.\r\n* Zoom out to 80% on Safari / Chrome / Firefox.\r\n\r\nMaybe, it depends on OS and the version of browsers.","created_at":"2020-04-11T21:33:10Z","updated_at":"2020-04-11T21:33:56Z","closed_at":"2020-04-11T21:33:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54a62c56afe5142ef5cdcec87ec05db367d1e860","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28191/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28191/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28191/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/76d0d22ba7c92883c4678c7fdab8884ec2116e48","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-infinite-redrawing","ref":"fix-infinite-redrawing","sha":"76d0d22ba7c92883c4678c7fdab8884ec2116e48","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReuse the `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` and `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` functions introduced by the PR #28119 in `DateTimeUtils`.`toJavaTimestamp()` and `fromJavaTimestamp()`. Actually, new implementation is derived from Spark 2.4 + rebasing via pre-calculated rebasing maps.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes speed up conversions to/from java.sql.Timestamp, and as a consequence the PR improve performance of ORC datasource in loading/saving timestamps:\r\n- Saving ~ **x2.8 faster** in master, and -11% against Spark 2.4.6\r\n- Loading - **x3.2-4.5 faster** in master, -5% against Spark 2.4.6\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nSave timestamps to ORC:                   Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove the requirement to launch a task in order to reset locality wait timer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecently https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27207 was merged, but contained a bug which leads to undesirable behavior.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the issue is that single resource offers couldn't reset the timer, if there had been a previous reject followed by an allResourceOffer with no available resources. \r\nThis lead to a problem where once locality level reached ANY, single resource offers are all accepted, leading allResourceOffers to be left with no resources to utilize (hence no task being launched on an all resource offer -> no timer reset). The task manager would be stuck in ANY locality level.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoting down here the downsides of using below reset conditions, in case we want to follow up.\r\nAs this is quite complex, I could easily be missing something, so please comment/respond if you have more bad behavior scenarios or find something wrong here:\r\nThe format is:\r\n\r\n> **Reset condition**\r\n>  - the unwanted side effect\r\n>      - the cause/use case\r\n\r\nBelow references to locality increase/decrease mean:\r\n```\r\nPROCESS_LOCAL, NODE_LOCAL ... .. ANY\r\n    ------ locality decrease --->\r\n   <----- locality increase -----\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Task launch:**\r\n- locality decrease:\r\n   - Blacklisting, FAIR/FIFO scheduling, or task resource requirements can minimize tasks launched\r\n - locality increase:\r\n   - single task launch decreases locality despite many tasks remaining\r\n\r\n**No delay schedule reject since last allFreeResource offer**\r\n- locality decrease: \r\n   - locality wait less than allFreeResource offer frequency, which occurs at least 1 per second\r\n- locality increase: \r\n   - single resource (or none) not rejected despite many tasks remaining (other lower priority tasks utilizing resources)\r\n\r\n**Current impl - No delay schedule reject since last (allFreeResource offer + task launch)**\r\n- locality decrease:\r\n  - all from above\r\n- locality increase:\r\n   - single resource accepted and task launched despite many tasks remaining\r\n\r\nThe current impl is an improvement on the legacy (task launch) in that unintended locality decrease case is similar and the unintended locality increase case only occurs when the cluster is fully utilized.\r\n\r\nFor the locality increase cases, perhaps a config which specifies a certain % of tasks in a taskset to finish before resetting locality levels would be helpful. \r\n\r\n**If** that was considered a good approach then perhaps removing the task launch as a requirement would eliminate most of downsides listed above.\r\nLemme know if you have more ideas for eliminating locality increase downside of **No delay schedule reject since last allFreeResource offer** \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTaskSchedulerImplSuite\r\n\r\nAlso manually tested similar to how I tested in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27207 using [this simple app](https://github.com/bmarcott/spark-test-apps/blob/master/src/main/scala/TestLocalityWait.scala).\r\n\r\nWith the new changes, given locality wait of 10s the behavior is generally:\r\n10 seconds of locality being respected, followed by a single full utilization of resources using ANY locality level, followed by 10 seconds of locality being respected, and so on\r\n\r\nIf the legacy flag is enabled (spark.locality.wait.legacyResetOnTaskLaunch=true), the behavior is only scheduling PROCESS_LOCAL tasks (only utilizing a single executor)\r\n\r\n@cloud-fan \r\n@tgravescs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR (SPARK-31422) aims to return empty result in order to avoid `NullPointerException` at `getStorageStatus` and `getMemoryStatus` which happens after `BlockManagerMaster` stops. The empty result is consistent with the current status of `SparkContext` because `BlockManager` and `BlockManagerMaster` is already stopped.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn `SparkEnv.stop`, the following stop sequence is used and `metricsSystem.stop` invokes `sink.stop`.\r\n```\r\nblockManager.master.stop()\r\nmetricsSystem.stop() --> sinks.foreach(_.stop)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, some sink can invoke `BlockManagerSource` and ends up with `NullPointerException` because `BlockManagerMaster` is already stopped and `driverEndpoint` became `null`.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\nat org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerMaster.getStorageStatus(BlockManagerMaster.scala:170)\r\nat org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerSource$$anonfun$10.apply(BlockManagerSource.scala:63)\r\nat org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerSource$$anonfun$10.apply(BlockManagerSource.scala:63)\r\nat org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerSource$$anon$1.getValue(BlockManagerSource.scala:31)\r\nat org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerSource$$anon$1.getValue(BlockManagerSource.scala:30)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `SparkContext` registers and forgets `BlockManagerSource` without deregistering, we had better avoid `NullPointerException` inside `BlockManagerMaster` preventively.\r\n```scala\r\n_env.metricsSystem.registerSource(new BlockManagerSource(_env.blockManager))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This will remove NPE for the users who uses `BlockManagerSource`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the newly added test cases.","created_at":"2020-04-11T06:27:03Z","updated_at":"2020-04-11T15:29:00Z","closed_at":"2020-04-11T15:27:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15516e9c7e073ada97d4b5a5cbe17803c4fd8680","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCheck more strictly that a field name can be used as a valid Java identifier in `ScalaReflection.serializerFor`\r\nTo check that, `SourceVersion` is used so that we need not add reserved keywords to be checked manually for the future Java versions (e.g, underscore, var, yield), .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current implementation, `enum` is not checked even though it's a reserved keyword.\r\nAlso, there are lots of characters and sequences of character including numeric literals but they are not checked.\r\nSo we can't get better error message with following code.\r\n```\r\ncase class  Data(`0`: Int)\r\nSeq(Data(1)).toDF.show\r\n\r\n20/04/11 03:24:24 ERROR CodeGenerator: failed to compile: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 43, Column 1: Expression \"value_0 = value_3\" is not a type\r\norg.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 43, Column 1: Expression \"value_0 = value_3\" is not a type\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. With this change and the code example above, we can get following error message.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: `0` is not a valid identifier of Java and cannot be used as field name\r\n- root class: \"Data\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe can config the executor cores by \"spark.executor.cores\". For example, if we config 8 cores for a executor, then the driver can only scheduler 8 tasks to this executor concurrently. In fact, most cases a task does not always occupy a core or more. More time, tasks spent on disk IO or network IO, so we can make driver to scheduler more than 8 tasks(virtual the cores to 16, 32 or more the executor report to driver) to this executor concurrently, it will make the whole job execute more quickly. This pull request add an implemention for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe can use more virtual cores to scheduler more tasks at the same time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we use Spark Streaming to consume records from kafka, the generated KafkaRDD‘s partition number is equal to kafka topic's partition number, so we can not use more cpu cores to execute the streaming task except we change the topic's partition number, but we can not increase the topic's partition number infinitely.\r\n\r\nWe can split a kafka partition into multiple KafkaRDD partitions, and we can config it, then we can use more cpu cores to execute the streaming task. This pull request add an implemention for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe can use more cpu cores to consume kafka topic records faster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest it in a real environment.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-10T15:14:43Z","updated_at":"2020-04-13T03:26:42Z","closed_at":"2020-04-13T03:26:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0fffd1ca9fdf055b415d484d00f8b9a8fdd3dac3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28182/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28182/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28182/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ab87cf9415dced0ebbb92ab2088300c0f60a46fa","head":{"label":"zengruios:SPARK-29799","ref":"SPARK-29799","sha":"ab87cf9415dced0ebbb92ab2088300c0f60a46fa","user":{"login":"zengruios","id":26316365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzE2MzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26316365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios","html_url":"https://github.com/zengruios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":220261992,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjAyNjE5OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"zengruios/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zengruios","id":26316365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzE2MzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26316365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios","html_url":"https://github.com/zengruios","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zengruios/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zengruios/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, remove newly added method: `def testChiSquare(dataset: Dataset[_], featuresCol: String, labelCol: String): Array[SelectionTestResult]`, because: 1) it is only used in `ChiSqSelector`; 2, since the returned dataframe of `def test(dataset: DataFrame, featuresCol: String, labelCol: String): DataFrame` only contains one row, after collect it back to driver, the results are similar;\r\n2, add method `def test(dataset: DataFrame, featuresCol: String, labelCol: String, flatten: Boolean): DataFrame` to return the flatten results;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, when get returned result dataframe, we may want to filter it like `pValue<0.1`, but current returned dataframe is hard to use;\r\n2, current impl need to collect all test results of all columns back to the driver, this is a bottleneck, if we return the flatten datafame, we no longer to collect them to driver;\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes:\r\n1, `def testChiSquare(dataset: Dataset[_], featuresCol: String, labelCol: String): Array[SelectionTestResult]` removed;\r\n2, the returned dataframe need an action to trigger computation;\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding missing unit tests in SQLMetricSuite to cover the code generated path.\r\n**Additional tests were added in the following unit tests.**\r\nFilter metrics, SortMergeJoin metrics, SortMergeJoin(outer) metrics, BroadcastHashJoin metrics,  ShuffledHashJoin metrics, BroadcastHashJoin(outer) metrics, BroadcastNestedLoopJoin metrics, BroadcastLeftSemiJoinHash metrics, CartesianProduct metrics,  SortMergeJoin(left-anti) metrics\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe existing tests in SQLMetricSuite only cover the interpreted path.\r\nIt is necessary for the tests to cover code generated path as well since CodeGenerated path is often used in production.\r\n\r\nThe PR doesn't change test(\"Aggregate metrics\") and test(\"ObjectHashAggregate metrics\"). The test(\"Aggregate metrics\") tests metrics when a HashAggregate is used. Enabling codegen forces the test to use ObjectHashAggregate rather than the regular HashAggregate. ObjectHashAggregate has a test of its own. Therefore, I feel these two tests need not enabling codegen is not necessary.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added debug statements in the code to make sure both Code generated and Interpreted paths are being exercised.\r\nI further used Intellij debugger to ensure that the newly added unit tests are in fact exercising both code generated and interpreted paths.","created_at":"2020-04-09T22:35:58Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T22:09:53Z","closed_at":"2020-04-20T21:41:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2bf28f9fd533712bdf5223fb21d9ed1466c73d66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28173/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28173/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28173/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/933a78134e5f2f152ca2e82f913ebfa5871aee9d","head":{"label":"sririshindra:SPARK-31389","ref":"SPARK-31389","sha":"933a78134e5f2f152ca2e82f913ebfa5871aee9d","user":{"login":"sririshindra","id":9795421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra","html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":245021426,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDUwMjE0MjY=","name":"spark","full_name":"sririshindra/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sririshindra","id":9795421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra","html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn regular ORC reader when `spark.sql.orc.enableVectorizedReader` is set to `false`, I propose to use `DaysWritable` in reading DATE values from ORC files. Currently, days from ORC files are converted to java.sql.Date, and then to days in Proleptic Gregorian calendar. So, the conversion to Java type can be eliminated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The PR fixes regressions in loading dates before the 1582 year from ORC files by when vectorised ORC reader is off.\r\n- The changes improve performance of regular ORC reader for DATE columns.\r\n  - x3.6 faster comparing to the current master\r\n  - x1.9-x4.3 faster against Spark 2.4.6\r\n\r\nBefore

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I am proposing a JSON function `valid_json`.\r\nThis function will check whether a given string is valid JSON string or not. It it is valid it will return `true`, if it is invalid it will return `false`. In case of `NULL` input `NULL` will be returned.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select valid_json('{[]}')\").show\r\n+----------------+\r\n|valid_json({[]})|\r\n+----------------+\r\n|           false|\r\n+----------------+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select valid_json('[1, 2, 3]')\").show\r\n+---------------------+\r\n|valid_json([1, 2, 3])|\r\n+---------------------+\r\n|                 true|\r\n+---------------------+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select valid_json(null)\").show\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n|valid_json(CAST(NULL AS STRING))|\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n|                            null|\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is one the most basic and required functions when we are dealing with JSON data. \r\nSay, user is reading a table then he can segregate the table into rows with valid JSON and rows with invalid JSON. Now user only needs to process on the rows containing valid/invalid JSON.\r\n\r\nThis function is supported by some popular databases as well. Some of them are :\r\n- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/json-attribute-functions.html#function_json-valid): `JSON_VALID`\r\n- [SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/isjson-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15): `ISJSON`\r\n- [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/sqlrf/SQL-JSON-Conditions.html#GUID-99B9493D-2929-4A09-BA39-A56F8E7319DA): `IS JSON`\r\n- [IBM Db2](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/systems/articles/sql-json-publishing-functions/): `IS JSON`\r\n- [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html#jvalid): `json_valid`\r\n- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/json_valid/): `JSON_VALID`\r\n- [Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/IS_VALID_JSON.html): `is_valid_json`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, Now users can use valid_json() function to verify whether the given JSON string is valid or not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with newly added test cases.","created_at":"2020-04-09T10:35:03Z","updated_at":"2020-07-29T00:31:54Z","closed_at":"2020-07-29T00:31:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e574bfdd2923e20a58d066159c5f3d5db3def63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c06abe06086a3a50a2c126cfe68ea94dd1647af2","head":{"label":"iRakson:isJSON","ref":"isJSON","sha":"c06abe06086a3a50a2c126cfe68ea94dd1647af2","user":{"login":"iRakson","id":15366835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY2ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15366835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson","html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205127207,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDUxMjcyMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"iRakson/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iRakson","id":15366835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY2ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15366835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson","html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome alias of expression can not display correctly in schema. This PR will fix them.\r\n- `TimeWindow`\r\n- `MaxBy`\r\n- `MinBy`\r\n- `UnaryMinus`\r\n- `BitwiseCount`\r\n\r\nThis PR also fix a typo issue, please look at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b7cde42b04b21c9bfee6535199cf385855c15853/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/ExpressionsSchemaSuite.scala#L142\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n\r\n1. `MaxBy` and `MinBy` extends `MaxMinBy` and the latter add a method `funcName` not needed.  We can reuse `prettyName` to replace `funcName`.\r\n2. Spark SQL exists some function no elegant implementation.For example: `BitwiseCount` override the sql method show below:\r\n`override def sql: String = s\"bit_count(${child.sql})\"`\r\nI don't think it's elegant enough.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to optimise the `DateTimeUtils`.`rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` and `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` functions, and make them faster by using pre-calculated rebasing tables. This approach allows to avoid expensive conversions via local timestamps. For example, the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone has just a few time points when difference between Proleptic Gregorian calendar and the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian since 1582-10-15) is changed in the time interval 0001-01-01 .. 2100-01-01:\r\n\r\n| i | local  timestamp | Proleptic Greg. seconds | Hybrid (Julian+Greg) seconds | difference in minutes| \r\n| -- | ------- |----|----| ---- |\r\n|0|0001-01-01 00:00|-62135568422|-62135740800|-2872|\r\n|1|0100-03-01 00:00|-59006333222|-59006419200|-1432|\r\n|...|...|...|...|...|\r\n|13|1582-10-15 00:00|-12219264422|-12219264000|7|\r\n|14|1883-11-18 12:00|-2717640000|-2717640000|0|\r\n\r\nThe difference in microseconds between Proleptic and hybrid calendars for any local timestamp in time intervals `[local timestamp(i), local timestamp(i+1))`, and for any microseconds in the time interval `[Gregorian micros(i), Gregorian micros(i+1))` is the same. In this way, we can rebase an input micros by following the steps:\r\n1. Look at the table, and find the time interval where the micros falls to\r\n2. Take the difference between 2 calendars for this time interval\r\n3. Add the difference to the input micros. The result is rebased microseconds that has the same local timestamp representation.\r\n\r\nHere are details of the implementation:\r\n- Pre-calculated tables are stored to JSON files `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` and `julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json` in the resource folder of `sql/catalyst`. The diffs and switch time points are stored as seconds, for example:\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"tz\" : \"America/Los_Angeles\",\r\n    \"switches\" : [ -62135740800, -59006419200, ... , -2717640000 ],\r\n    \"diffs\" : [ 172378, 85978, ..., 0 ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n  The JSON files are generated by 2 tests in `RebaseDateTimeSuite` - `generate 'gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json'` and `generate 'julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json'`. Both tests are disabled by default. \r\n  The `switches` time points are ordered from old to recent timestamps. This condition is checked by the test `validate rebase records in JSON files` in `RebaseDateTimeSuite`. Also sizes of the `switches` and `diffs` arrays are the same (this is checked by the same test).\r\n\r\n- The **_Asia/Tehran, Iran, Africa/Casablanca and Africa/El_Aaiun_** time zones weren't added to the JSON files, see [SPARK-31385](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31385)\r\n- The rebase info from the JSON files is placed to hash tables - `gregJulianRebaseMap` and `julianGregRebaseMap`. I use `AnyRefMap` because it is almost 2 times faster than Scala's immutable Map. Also I tried `java.util.HashMap` but it has worse lookup time than `AnyRefMap` in our case.\r\nThe hash maps store the switch time points and diffs in microseconds precision to avoid conversions from microseconds to seconds in the runtime.\r\n\r\n- I moved the code related to days and microseconds rebasing to the separate object `RebaseDateTime` to do not pollute `DateTimeUtils`. Tests related to date-time rebasing are moved to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` for the same reason.\r\n\r\n- I placed rebasing via local timestamp to separate methods that require zone id as the first parameter assuming that the caller has zone id already. This allows to void unnecessary retrieving the default time zone. The methods are marked as `private[sql]` because they are used in `RebaseDateTimeSuite` as reference implementation.\r\n\r\n- Modified the `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` and `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` methods in `RebaseDateTime` to look up the rebase tables first of all. If hash maps don't contain rebasing info for the given time zone id, the methods falls back to the implementation via local timestamps. This allows to support time zones specified as zone offsets like '-08:00'.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make timestamps rebasing faster:\r\n- Saving timestamps to parquet files is ~ **x3.8 faster**\r\n- Loading timestamps from parquet files is ~**x2.8 faster**.\r\n- Loading timestamps by Vectorized reader ~**x4.6 faster**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added the test `validate rebase records in JSON files` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite`. The test validates 2 json files from the resource folder - `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` and `julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json`, and it checks per each time zone records that\r\n  - the number of switch points is equal to the number of diffs between calendars. If the numbers are different, this will violate the assumption made in `RebaseDateTime.rebaseMicros`.\r\n  - swith points are ordered from old to recent timestamps. This pre-condition is required for linear search in the `rebaseMicros` function.\r\n- Added the test `optimization of micros rebasing - Gregorian to Julian` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` which iterates over timestamps from 0001-01-01 to 2100-01-01 with the steps 1 ± 0.5 months, and checks that optimised function `RebaseDateTime`.`rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` returns the same result as non-optimised one. The check is performed for the UTC, PST, CET, Africa/Dakar, America/Los_Angeles, Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Hong_Kong, Europe/Amsterdam time zones.\r\n- Added the test `optimization of micros rebasing - Julian to Gregorian` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` which does similar checks as the test above but for rebasing from the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian) to Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\r\n- The tests for days rebasing are moved from `DateTimeUtilsSuite` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` because the rebasing related code is moved from `DateTimeUtils` to the separate object `RebaseDateTime`.\r\n- Re-run `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` at the America/Los_Angeles time zone (it is set explicitly in the PR #28127):\r\n\r\n| Item | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----|\r\n| Region | us-west-2 (Oregon) |\r\n| Instance

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitly mention that the requirement of Iterator of Series to Iterator of Series and Iterator of Multiple Series to Iterator of Series (previously Scalar Iterator pandas UDF).\r\n\r\nThe actual limitation of this UDF is the same length of the _entire input and output_, instead of each series's length. Namely you can do something as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Iterator, Tuple\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf       \r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"long\")\r\ndef func(\r\n        iterator: Iterator[pd.Series]) -> Iterator[pd.Series]:\r\n    return iter([pd.concat(iterator)])\r\n\r\nspark.range(100).select(func(\"id\")).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis characteristic allows you to prefetch the data from the iterator to speed up, compared to the regular Scalar to Scalar (previously Scalar pandas UDF).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo document the correct restriction and characteristics of a feature.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes in the documentation but only in unreleased branches.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGithub Actions should test the documentation build

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd DataSourceRegisterV2, an alternative method for DataSourceV2 plugins to register themselves. The motivation is to add a layer of indirection between the data source registration and data source provider, so plugin developers have a chance choose at runtime which implementation Spark should use.  Discussion at:\r\n\r\nhttp://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DSv2-amp-DataSourceRegister-td29187.html\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs the DSv2 API evolves, some breaking changes are occasionally made to the API. It's possible to split a plugin into a \"common\" part and multiple version-specific parts and this works good to have a single artifact for users. The one part that can't be currently worked around is the DataSourceRegister trait. This is an issue because users cargo-cult configuration values, and choosing the wrong plugin version gives a particularly baroque error message that bubbles up through ServiceLoader.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, developer only.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`CliSuite.runCliWithin` was not matching for expected results correctly. It was matching for expected lines anywhere in stdout or stderr.\r\nOn the example of `Single command with --database` test:\r\nIn\r\n```\r\n    runCliWithin(2.minute)(\r\n      \"CREATE DATABASE hive_db_test;\"\r\n        -> \"\",\r\n      \"USE hive_test;\"\r\n        -> \"\",\r\n      \"CREATE TABLE hive_test(key INT, val STRING);\"\r\n        -> \"\",\r\n      \"SHOW TABLES;\"\r\n        -> \"hive_test\"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nIt was looking for lines containing \"\", \"\", \"\" and then \"hive_test\".\r\nHowever, the string \"hive_test\" was contained in \"hive_test_db\", and hence:\r\n```\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:12,752 INFO  CliSuite - 2020-04-08 17:53:12.752 - stderr> Spark master: local, Application Id: local-1586368384172\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:12,765 INFO  CliSuite - stderr> found expected output line 0: \"\"\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:12,765 INFO  CliSuite - 2020-04-08 17:53:12.765 - stdout> spark-sql> CREATE DATABASE hive_db_test;\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:12,765 INFO  CliSuite - stdout> found expected output line 1: \"\"\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:17,688 INFO  CliSuite - 2020-04-08 17:53:17.688 - stderr> chgrp: changing ownership of 'file:///tmp/spark-8811f069-4cba-4c71-a5d6-62dd925fb5ff': chown: changing group of '/tmp/spark-8811f069-4cba-4c71-a5d6-62dd925fb5ff': Operation not permitted\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:12,765 INFO  CliSuite - stderr> found expected output line 2: \"\"\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:18,069 INFO  CliSuite - 2020-04-08 17:53:18.069 - stderr> Time taken: 5.265 seconds\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:18,087 INFO  CliSuite - 2020-04-08 17:53:18.087 - stdout> spark-sql> USE hive_test;\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:12,765 INFO  CliSuite - stdout> found expected output line 3: \"hive_test\"\r\n2020-04-08 17:53:21,742 INFO  CliSuite - Found all expected output.\r\n```\r\nBecause of that, it could kill the CLI process without really even creating the table. This was not expected. The test could be flaky depending on whether process.destroy() in the finally block managed to kill it before it actually creates the table.\r\n\r\nI make the output checking more robust to not match on unexpected output, by making it check the echo of query output on the CLI. Also, wait for the CLI process to finish gracefully (triggered by closing its stdin), instead of killing it forcibly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.CliSuite was flaky, and didn't test outputs as expected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests in CLISuite. Tested several times with no flakiness. Was getting flaky results almost on every run before.\r\n```\r\n[info] CliSuite:\r\n[info] - load warehouse dir from hive-site.xml (12 seconds, 568 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - load warehouse dir from

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe update methods in HiveThriftServer2Listener now check if the parameter operation/session ID actually exist in the `sessionList` and `executionList` respectively. This prevents NullPointerExceptions if the operation or session ID is unknown. Instead, a warning is written to the log.\r\n\r\nAlso, in HiveSessionImpl.close(), we catch any exception thrown by `operationManager.closeOperation`. If for any reason this throws an exception, other operations are not prevented from being closed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe listener's update methods would throw an exception if the operation or session ID is unknown. In Spark 2, where the listener is called directly, this hampers with the caller's control flow. In Spark 3, the exception is caught by the ListenerBus but results in an uninformative NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nIn HiveSessionImpl.close(), if an exception is thrown when closing an operation, all following operations are not closed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to show a better error message when a user mistakenly installs `pyspark` from PIP but the default `python` does not point out the corresponding `pip`. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46286436/running-pyspark-after-pip-install-pyspark/49587560 as an example.\r\n\r\nIt can be reproduced as below:\r\n\r\nI have two Python executables. `python` is Python 3.7, `pip` binds with Python 3.7 and `python2.7` is Python 2.7.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____              __\r\n     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__\r\n    _\\ \\/ _ \\/ _ `/ __/  '_/\r\n   /__ / .__/\\_,_/_/ /_/\\_\\   version 2.4.5\r\n      /_/\r\n\r\nUsing Python version 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019 09:23:15)\r\nSparkSession available as 'spark'.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nPYSPARK_PYTHON=python2.7 pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nCould not find valid SPARK_HOME while searching ['/Users', '/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin']\r\n/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/pyspark: line 24: /bin/load-spark-env.sh: No such file or directory\r\n/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/pyspark: line 77: /bin/spark-submit: No such file or directory\r\n/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/pyspark: line 77: exec: /bin/spark-submit: cannot execute: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are multiple questions outside about this error and they have no idea what's going on. See:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46286436/running-pyspark-after-pip-install-pyspark/49587560\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45991888/path-issue-could-not-find-valid-spark-home-while-searching\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49707239/pyspark-could-not-find-valid-spark-home\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55569985/pyspark-could-not-find-valid-spark-home\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48296474/error-could-not-find-valid-spark-home-while-searching-pycharm-in-windows\r\n- https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/8076\r\n\r\nThe answer is usually setting `SPARK_HOME`; however this isn't completely correct. \r\n\r\nIt works if you set `SPARK_HOME` because `pyspark` executable script directly imports the library by using `SPARK_HOME` (see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/bin/pyspark#L52-L53) instead of the default package location specified via `python` executable. So, this way you use a package installed in a different Python, which isn't ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it fixes the error message better.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nCould not find valid SPARK_HOME while searching ['/Users', '/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin']\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nCould not find valid SPARK_HOME while searching ['/Users', '/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin']\r\n\r\nDid you install PySpark via a package manager such as pip or Conda? If so,\r\nPySpark was not found in your Python environment. It is possible your\r\nPython environment does not properly bind with your package manager.\r\n\r\nPlease check your default 'python' and if you set PYSPARK_PYTHON and/or\r\nPYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON environment variables, and see if you can import\r\nPySpark, for example, 'python -c 'import pyspark'.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot import, you can install by using the Python executable directly,\r\nfor example, 'python -m pip install pyspark [--user]'. Otherwise, you can also\r\nexplicitly set the Python executable, that has PySpark installed, to\r\nPYSPARK_PYTHON or PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON environment variables, for example,\r\n'PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 pyspark'.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as described above.","created_at":"2020-04-08T08:23:01Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:58Z","closed_at":"2020-04-09T02:04:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"808893783c82e01272c2411507e19a8dc4835442","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28152/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28152/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28152/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/099b13708a9801f6f4073163bc1a384778b1a42a","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-31382","ref":"SPARK-31382","sha":"099b13708a9801f6f4073163bc1a384778b1a42a","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- View catalog interface\r\n- View resolution rules\r\n- View SQL DDL implementations\r\n\r\nThese view SQL DDLs will be done in follow-up PRs:\r\n- SHOW TBLPROPERTIES\r\n- SHOW VIEWS\r\n\r\nMost changes are pretty surgical. Please review the view substitution rule.\r\n\r\n#### View substitution\r\n\r\nPropose a new `ViewSubstitution` rule that takes a different approach than the current AnalysisContext. Here are some highlights:\r\n\r\n- The rule is added to the “Substitution” batch, same as “CTESubstitution”.\r\n- Temp views are processed first.\r\n- Identifiers for “SQLOnFile” are excluded.\r\n- In the plan parsed from view sql text, substitute CTEs first, then fully qualify all identifiers with the currentCatalog and currentNamespace stored in the view metadata.\r\n- Validate `currentCatalog` is still registered. Other than that, we have to assume registered catalogs have not undergone any breaking change between view creation and usage.\r\n\r\n#### TODO: viewQueryColumnNames\r\n\r\nPropose viewQueryColumnNames to be stored in view properties just as it is currently in Hive metastore table properties. If not in view properties, we can derive from schema field names.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSupport view catalog in DataSourceV2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI found a bug in the stage level scheduling dynamic allocation code when you have a non default profile and it has an initial number of executors the same as what the number of executors needed for the first job, then we don't properly request the executors.  This causes a hang.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that when a new stage is added and the initial number of executors is set, we set the target to be the initial number.  Unfortunately that makes the code in the update and sync function think it has already requested that number.  So to fix this, when there is an initial number we just go ahead and request executors at that point. This is basically what happens on startup to handle the case with the default profile.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nbug\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nunit test and manually test on yarn cluster. Went though multiple scenarios initial numbers, minimum number and number executor required by the first stage.","created_at":"2020-04-07T18:16:43Z","updated_at":"2020-04-07T21:55:47Z","closed_at":"2020-04-07T21:06:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66c2378f937030d9327192966f118635801c1fe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR (SPARK-31379) adds one line `when(ts.resourceOffers(any[IndexedSeq[WorkerOffer]])).thenReturn(Seq.empty)` to avoid allocating resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe test is flaky and here's part of error stack:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsbt.ForkMain$ForkError: org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedDueToTimeoutException:\r\nThe code passed to eventually never returned normally. Attempted 325 times over 5.01070979 seconds.\r\nLast failure message: ArrayBuffer(\"1\", \"3\") did not equal Array(\"0\", \"1\", \"3\").\r\n...\r\norg.apache.spark.scheduler.CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackendSuite.eventually(CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackendSuite.scala:45)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can check [here](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/120786/testReport/org.apache.spark.scheduler/CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackendSuite/extra_resources_from_executor/) for details.\r\n\r\nAnd it is flaky because:  after sending `StatusUpdate` to `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend`, `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` will call `makeOffer` immediately once releasing the resources. So, it's possible that `availableAddrs` has allocated again before we assert `execResources(GPU).availableAddrs.sorted === Array(\"0\", \"1\", \"3\")`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe issue can be stably reproduced by inserting `Thread.sleep(3000)` after the line of sending `StatusUpdate`. After applying this fix, the issue is gone.","created_at":"2020-04-07T15:09:29Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T09:02:53Z","closed_at":"2020-04-08T08:54:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a5579a20d0fb61bdc2a979ec690cc5d52e9cb73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK
