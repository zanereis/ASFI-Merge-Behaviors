MockHTable uses an ArrayList to store a log of Puts that have been submitted against the MockHTable. The MockHTable, along with the put log, is accessed from multiple threads during the integration tests. Access to the Put log is not thread safe, which is likely at least one cause of [METRON-597](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-597).\r\n\r\nThe Put log is used by multiple tests, but more so by the ProfilerIntegrationTest. This tests polls the list to block the thread until the expected number of Puts have been submitted. This is likely why this test is more impacted by this issue than others.\r\n\r\nThe Put Log needs to made thread safe.  See `org.apache.metron.test.mock.MockHTable.putLog`.  This is the smallest change that I could think of that would address the issue.\r\n\r\nI have triggered this code to run in Travis CI many times without seeing a failure.  Prior to this the Travis CI builds would more likely fail than not.  I have also continually run the impacted tests over many hours without replicating the problem.  In all fairness, on the current master branch without this fix, I was only able to replicate the problem once on my local machine (after running many

have 7 or so integration tests that implement the Processor interface.

[METRON-576](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-576)\r\n\r\nWhen running the Stellar REPL in a cluster on AWS, function resolution takes 50-60 seconds. The user is not able to execute any functions in the REPL until this process completes.  \r\n\r\nThe default function resolver searches the entire classpath for Stellar functions.  This includes all library dependencies.  The delay is because there are just too many classes in the classpath to search on a running cluster. As more libraries are added as dependencies under `/usr/metron/0.3.0/lib` this problem just gets worse.\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n\r\nTested on Quick Dev and showed definite performance improvement.  Before limiting the search path, the search takes roughly 18-20 seconds for me.  After adding a sensible \"include\" like `org.apache.metron.*`, the search takes roughly 2-3 seconds.\r\n\r\nHave not yet deployed on AWS to compare the load time.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\n* A global property allows the user to specify packages that should be searched for Stellar functions.  `stellar.function.resolver.includes = org.apache.metron.*`  This significantly reduces the delay when waiting for the Stellar REPL to be ready to execute a function. \r\n\r\n* Another global property allows the user to exclude specific packages from being searched for Stellar functions.  `stellar.function.resolver.excludes = org.apache.metron.management.*`\r\n\r\n* By default, the entire classpath is searched, which matches the previous behavior.  I'd be open to changing default behavior if there is interest.  \r\n\r\n* All of the logic that was previously contained in SingletonFunctionResolver is now broken out across multiple classes.\r\n\r\n     * The `BaseFunctionResolver` leverages Guava for lazy initialization and thread-safety, instead of the read/write locking scheme as before.  This is much simpler and I believe is effectively the same.  \r\n     * The `ClasspathFunctionResolver` uses the Reflections API to search the classpath for Stellar functions as before.  This functionality was enhanced to explicitly include or exclude specific packages from function resolution.  \r\n    * The `SingletonFunctionResolver` remains, but is really only a singleton that is used as the default function resolver.  Keeping this separate made testing simpler.\r\n     * The `SimpleFunctionResolver` is a function resolver that allows single classes to be searched for Stellar functions.  This is useful when writing unit tests for Stellar functions.\r\n    ```\r\n    FunctionResolver functionResolver = new SimpleFunctionResolver()\r\n            .withClass(KafkaFunctions.KafkaGet.class)\r\n            .withClass(KafkaFunctions.KafkaPut.class)\r\n            .withClass(KafkaFunctions.KafkaProps.class)\r\n            .withClass(KafkaFunctions.KafkaTail.class);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* Added unit tests for the function resolvers.\r\n* Removed the `clear()` function from the `FunctionResolver` API.  This was only needed for testing. This was originally only a work-around since it was not easy to swap in another `FunctionResolver` at the

PR addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-580\r\n\r\nThe purpose here is to keep us from having to grep for version numbers in the MPack code the next time we bump the Metron version number. The change sets up a \"CURRENT\" version directory for the mpack code. The Maven Assembly plugin is then used to perform two operations: token replacement in source files, and movement of source files from CURRENT -> METRON VERSION in the final packaging layout.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nFollow install instructions here - https://www.evernote.com/shard/s530/sh/c5551fbd-0ac1-4861-89ce-9c5e37065c52/b13e05f39eaac1a6\r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\n[\r\nPlease do not do this step -> \"git clone https://github.com/justinleet/metron-rpm localrepo\". Instead, build the project and MPacks from scratch doing the following:\r\n\r\nFrom Metron home: `mvn clean package -DskipTests`\r\nFrom metron-deployment: `mvn clean package -Pbuild-rpms && mvn clean package`\r\n\r\nThen you'll want to mount the generated rpm's you built by setting the DOCKER_OPTS var\r\nexport DOCKER_OPTS=\"-v ${metron-project-home}/metron-deployment/packaging/docker/rpm-docker/RPMS/noarch:/localrepo\"\r\n]\r\n\r\n**Note** - if you are using Z shell, there is some wonkiness with the ambari docker stuff. Run this using Bash and you should be ok.\r\nMake sure you start any sensors *last* to ensure the install goes smoothly in a local dev machine. For this change and test, I only started up the bro sensor.\r\n\r\nI also modified the sensor-test-mode yaf task to include \"ignore_errors: yes\" - there appears to be an issue with Ansible wrt OS'es with systemd -

the flux files, added outputs for the various `GenericEnrichmentBolt` used throughout, to tie their error output streams to Kafka topics.  Specifically, enrichment is tied to enrichments_error and threat intel is tied to threatintel_error.\r\n\r\nQuick-dev and the Ambari mpack are updated to ensure the topics are created, so that no errors occur on usage.  Both were run up to ensure that the topics were created and the flux files don't give errors.\r\n\r\nTo test, an adjustment was made to the `EnrichmentIntegrationTest` to have an enrichment bolt that always throws errors.  This bolt is derived from `GenericEnrichmentBolt` (which has been slightly refactored) to ensure that it uses the same error logic, but ignores the actual logic that leads to errors.  This was done because I couldn't find input that resulted in the error stream code path in actual practice.  Other errors can result, but don't go to the error stream (e.g. JSON decoding errors).\r\n\r\nAs a note, the `ErrorEnrichmentBolt` invariably ends up in the stack traces being printed (which is not handled by `ErrorEnrichmentBolt` or `GenericEnrichmentBolt`).\r\n\r\nGiven that the test explicitly calls `UnitTestHelper.verboseLogging()`, I'm not sure how to suppress that without killing actual errors at the same time is.  Open to suggestions if someone knows a more appropriate way to handle it (if we care).\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-21T12:01:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T17:44:40Z","closed_at":"2016-11-23T17:44:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"76018713ea1f5900bdf7fe0c7ff937f404c0ed91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/363/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/363/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/363/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/19307ef0301ea6654561606db0924eed0f1fbe4a","head":{"label":"justinleet:error_handling","ref":"error_handling","sha":"19307ef0301ea6654561606db0924eed0f1fbe4a","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62403147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQwMzE0Nw==","name":"metron","full_name":"justinleet/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet/metron","description":"Mirror

Problem\r\n\r\n[METRON-517](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-517)\r\n\r\nThe bro uri field in [HTTP::Info](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/protocols/http/main.bro.html#type-HTTP::Info) can grow to a size which fails to insert the message into Elasticsearch.  The related error message is:\r\n`IllegalArgumentException[Document contains at least one immense term in field=\\\"uri\\\" (whose UTF8 encoding is longer than the max length 32766), all of which were skipped...`\r\n\r\n## Short-term Solution\r\n\r\nSet the elasticsearch template to [ignore the URI field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ignore-above.html) if it is greater than 10922 (32776 / 3) bytes, as [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) allows UTF-8 characters to be used in URIs.  32766 is a size limitation built into Lucene

Then fix the configuration and resubmit the message to try again. I also won’t have to go outside of the Stellar REPL to monitor topic activity.\r\n\r\n### `KAFKA_GET`\r\n \r\nRetrieves messages from a Kafka topic.  Subsequent calls will continue retrieving messages sequentially from the original offset.\r\n \r\nExample: Retrieve one message from a topic.\r\n```\r\nKAFKA_GET('topic')\r\n```\r\nExample: Retrieve 10 messages from a topic.\r\n```\r\n KAFKA_GET('topic', 10)\r\n```\r\nExample: Retrieve the first message in a topic.  This must be the first retrieval from the topic, otherwise the messages will be retrieved starting from the previously stored consumer offset.\r\n```\r\nKAFKA_GET('topic', 1, { \"auto.offset.reset\": \"earliest\" })\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `KAFKA_TAIL`\r\n\r\nRetrieves messages from a Kafka topic always starting with the most recent message first.\r\n\r\nExample: Retrieve the latest message from a topic.\r\n ```\r\nKAFKA_TAIL('topic')\r\n```\r\nExample: Retrieve 10 messages from a topic starting with the latest.\r\n ```\r\nKAFKA_TAIL('topic', 10)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `KAFKA_PUT`\r\n\r\nSends messages to a Kafka topic.\r\n\r\nExample: Put two messages on the topic 'topic'.\r\n```\r\n KAFKA_PUT('topic', [\"message1\", \"message2\"])\r\n```\r\nExample: Put a message on a topic and also define an alternative Kafka broker.\r\n```\r\nKAFKA_PUT('topic', [\"message1\"], { \"bootstrap.servers\": \"kafka-broker-1:6667\" })\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `KAFKA_PROPS`\r\n\r\nRetrieves the Kafka properties that are used by other KAFKA_* functions like KAFKA_GET and KAFKA_PUT.  The Kafka properties are compiled from a set of default properties, the global properties, and any overrides.\r\n\r\nExample: Retrieve the current Kafka properties.\r\n```\r\nKAFKA_PROPS()\r\n```\r\nExample: Retrieve the current Kafka properties taking into account a set of overrides.\r\n```\r\nKAFKA_PROPS({ \"max.poll.records\": 1 })\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThese were tested on a local Stellar Shell in addition to running within the \"Quick Dev\" environment.  Note that in the \"Quick Dev\" environment, you must manually copy the jar built within the Management project (`metron-platform/metron-management/target/...`) to `/usr/metron/0.2.1BETA/lib`.","created_at":"2016-11-10T20:59:20Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T19:00:42Z","closed_at":"2016-11-16T22:06:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9ac8a10618b76e2b7467bce80b9bbef30c60d68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/354/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/354/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/354/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/ac97fd562a8e738321c784f0fac346d6d850971a","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-557","ref":"METRON-557","sha":"ac97fd562a8e738321c784f0fac346d6d850971a","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

the version from 0.2.1BETA to 0.3.0 throughout the code.  This includes altering the Ambari mpack to appropriately handle the version, along with Ansible files to ensure dev environments function appropriately.\r\n\r\nTo test this, the mpack, quick dev, full dev were spun up, with some data passed through topologies, and generally ensuring things worked as expected.\r\n\r\nI have not included the write up, but mostly because I'm unsure where the best place to put it is.  The root README doesn't seem like the right place, because that's more a general project overview. Anything below root is too hidden for project wide instructions.  The wiki has potential, but we'd need to figure out exactly where we want to put it. If someone has a location they think is appropriate, please weigh in.\r\n\r\nPreliminary writeup for commentary, feel free to give feedback or have me clear up anything that's a little opaque.\r\n\r\n> Updating the version of Metron\r\nThere are a couple steps in order to properly update the version of Metron throughout the project.\r\n>1) Find and replace the instances of the current version number (e.g. 0.2.1BETA) with the new version number (e.g. 0.3.0).  These instances appear in the various pom.xml files, READMEs, along with some of the files for both Ansible and Ambari management pack deployments.  Note that caution should be used to avoid unnecessary changes, because these strings could appear in tests or configuration (e.g. 10.0.3.0 contains '0.3.0' and should not be replaced).\r\n>2) Rename metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/METRON/<old_version> to metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/METRON/<new_version>\r\n>3) Rename metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/addon-services/METRON/<old_version> to metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/addon-services/METRON/<new_version>\r\n>4) Alter metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/METRON/<version>/service_advisor.py.  This file contains a class, e.g. METRON021BETAServiceAdvisor (for version 0.2.1BETA).  The middle portion should be moved to the new version and make sure to drop separators (e.g. 0.3.0 has METRON030ServiceAdvisor).\r\n>5) Ensure tests, development environments, and management pack continue to function

PR accomplishes primarily 2 things:  sets the log level for all components (and their dependencies) to ERROR and suppresses ERROR log statements in tests for cases where an exception is expected.  Ideally a combination of this PR and #344 will make the output logs in Travis much cleaner.\r\n\r\nThe approach for setting the log level is to exclude all transitive SJF4J bindings and instead declare the log4j binding in the metron-platform and metron-analytics poms (would top level be better?).  There is some code that uses log4j instead SLF4J so this binding seemed appropriate.  Now there are no more SLF4J warnings and the log level for every component can be configured in test/resources/log4j.properties.  It is currently set to ERROR by default but do we want to add different log files for different profiles (dev, travis, prod, etc)?\r\n\r\nThe approach for suppressing expected ERROR log messages is to temporarily change the log level to SEVERE/FATAL during a test that generates an ERROR message and change it back right after the test (or line within the test) has executed.  A couple of methods to programmatically change the log level at runtime was added to the UnitTestHelper class.  \r\n\r\nThere were a few test cases where an exception was incorrectly thrown so I fixed those (BulkMessageWriterBoltTest.java and ParserBoltTest.java).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of different ways to do logging so I'm expecting the community will have opinions on what the right approach is for us.  I have tested this with unit/integration tests and will test with vagrant once we get closer to a consensus.","created_at":"2016-11-07T15:28:56Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T18:41:22Z","closed_at":"2016-11-09T18:41:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe935278163ee4caeab7aca64c3a0461d986d79b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/fe91c5e505b06afa1cf9cae7207bdee3e99a1c0c","head":{"label":"merrimanr:METRON-541","ref":"METRON-541","sha":"fe91c5e505b06afa1cf9cae7207bdee3e99a1c0c","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62420865,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQyMDg2NQ==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"merrimanr/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

is.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nEdit the bro enrichment config in $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/enrichments/bro.json\r\n\r\nAdd a predicate to the riskLevelRules that does not return a boolean value, e.g. `\"TO_UPPER(protocol)\" : 0.92\"` as shown in the example below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n  \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n  \"enrichment\" : {\r\n    \"fieldMap\": {\r\n      \"geo\": [\"ip_dst_addr\", \"ip_src_addr\"],\r\n      \"host\": [\"host\"]\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"threatIntel\": {\r\n    \"fieldMap\": {\r\n      \"hbaseThreatIntel\": [\"ip_src_addr\", \"ip_dst_addr\"]\r\n    },\r\n    \"fieldToTypeMap\": {\r\n      \"ip_src_addr\" : [\"malicious_ip\"],\r\n      \"ip_dst_addr\" : [\"malicious_ip\"]\r\n    },\r\n    \"triageConfig\" : {\r\n\t\"riskLevelRules\" : {\r\n\t    \"exists(ip_dst_addr)\" : 0.10,\r\n\t    \"TO_UPPER(protocol) == 'HTTP'\" : 0.91,\r\n\t    \"TO_UPPER(protocol)\" : 0.92,\r\n\t    \"exists(ip_dst_port)\" : 0.20,\r\n\t    \"exists(ip_src_port)\" :

configuration in zookeeper doing the following:\r\n```\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z node1:2181 -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe configuration should push out to the enrichment topology. You will need to wait a bit for new bro messages to percolate through the system. Verify the new, more specific error message in the storm worker logs, an example of which is shown below.\r\n\r\nexample path for enrichment -

PR builds on top of @nickwallen 's work in METRON-529, which has already been committed to master.  It adds an optional argument to PROFILE_GET, allowing run-time overrides of the profiler client global configuration parameters.  The primary use case is when historical profiles have been created with a different profile configuration than is currently configured, and the analyst needing to access them does not want to change the global client configuration so as not to disrupt the work of other analysts working with current profiles.\r\n\r\nThe proposed placement of the optional Map argument is before the group sequence, so as not to disrupt the current usage of a variable-length sequence of 'group' arguments.  Example:\r\n```\r\n// Retrieve all values for 'entity1' from 'profile1' that occurred on 'weekdays' over the past month,\r\n// overriding the usual global client configuration parameters for window duration.\r\nPROFILE_GET('profile1', 'entity1', 1, 'MONTHS', {'profiler.client.period.duration' : '2', 'profiler.client.period.duration.units' : 'MINUTES'}, 'weekdays')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to change the 'groups' argument into a List, rather than a variable-length sequence of Strings, then put the config_override Map after the groups List.  Let me know if you think this would be a better implementation, as I can change it very quickly.  Of course the original usage would be retained for backward compatibility, but perhaps deprecated.\r\n\r\nTesting:  This change is restricted to the Stellar function implementation, so the expanded junit test is largely sufficient.  Also, a previous version of this code passed Travis in a preview PR against Nick's work

is an effort to eliminate spam errors from our testing and hopefully improve our testing at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis PR will track the commits for this effort, and allow for timely comment and review.\r\n\r\nSo far the things we are looking for or seeing are\r\n\r\n- problems with shutdown dependencies with the testing components like yarn and zk\r\n- problems were we cannot completely mock out components.  Even if the tests pass, we are spammed with errors because of the attempts to connect to components that are part of the test because they are not needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of Apache Storm Issue STORM-1730\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-1730 it is not possible\r\nto shutdown the LocalServer we use for storm without leaking threads.\r\nThese threads will output error messages when they 'wake up' and try to connect\r\nwith curator - to a zk embedded server that has already been shutdown.\r\nThis issue is fixed in Storm 1.0.3, but that is not released yet\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of this unresolved issue  ZOOKEEPER-1237: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1237 we also may see errors like\r\nRunning org.apache.metron.enrichment.integration.EnrichmentIntegrationTest\r\n\r\n2016-11-09 22:25:50,293 ERROR [SyncThread:0] server.NIOServerCnxn (NIOServerCnxn.java:sendBuffer(178)) - Unexpected Exception: \r\n\r\njava.nio.channels.CancelledKeyException\r\n\r\n\tat sun.nio.ch.SelectionKeyImpl.ensureValid(SelectionKeyImpl.java:73)\r\n\r\n\tat sun.nio.ch.SelectionKeyImpl.interestOps(SelectionKeyImpl.java:77)\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn.sendBuffer(NIOServerCnxn.java:151)\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.storm.shade.org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxn.sendResponse(NIOServerCnxn.java:1081)\r\n\r\n\tat \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy goal is to keep this PR mergable with every commit as I go.

addition to the main goal, there's a couple minor changes I made while I was in the neighborhood for simple changes that didn't seem to make sense to bother with separate PRs. If anyone wants them to be split out, I'm happy to break the commit up appropriately.\r\n\r\nThis PR covers 3 things:\r\n\r\n1. The original directory fix.  It did exist before, but was configured to be /tmp/metron/enriched.  This moves it to be consistent with quick-dev and adjusts the folder's permissions appropriately so that it can actually be written to by Storm (owned by the Hadoop group with 755 perms, same as quick dev).  Complimentary to this the /apps/metron/patterns folder is properly created and used.  It was defined in configs before, but /apps/metron was passed instead of the /apps/metron/patterns.\r\n\r\n2. Pcap RPM never got installed.  It's a simple three line change to make sure the scripts get deployed.\r\n\r\n3. Made the is_configured files consistent (enrichment had slightly different file pattern).  One line config change.\r\n\r\nTo test, I used the docker-ambari procedure outline at: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s530/sh/c5551fbd-0ac1-4861-89ce-9c5e37065c52/b13e05f39eaac1a6\r\n\r\nAfter spinning up the instance and installing the service, the directories are appropriately created (/apps/metron/enrichments and /apps/metron/patterns).  The Metron home directory on the nodes contains the pcap scripts and yum reports the pcap rpm as installed.  Finally, the configured files are all just

[METRON-529](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-529)\r\n\r\nBy default, the Profiler creates Profiles with a period duration of 15 minutes. This means that data is accumulated, summarized and flushed every 15 minutes. The Client API must also have knowledge of this duration to correctly retrieve the profile data. If the client API is expecting 15 minute periods, it will not be able to read data generated by a Profiler that has been configured with a 1 hour period.\r\n\r\nThe period duration can be configured in the Profiler by altering the Profiler topology's static properties file. The Stellar Client API currently provides no means to configure the period duration and defaults also to 15 minutes. This means that the Stellar Client API can only read profiles with a period duration of 15 minutes. \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this limitation so that the Profiler Client can be configured to read profile data no matter what configuration settings were used to generate that data.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this change in the \"Quick Dev\" environment.  I used the Profiler to create a Profile using a 1 minute period.  I then confirmed that I was unable to read the data using the Profiler client with the default client configuration.  I then changed the client configuration to a 1 minute duration.  I was then able to read the profile data as expected.\r\n\r\n#### Steps\r\n\r\n1. Ensure the Snort sensor and the Snort parser are running.  Stop all other topologies and sensors.\r\n\r\n2. Edit `/usr/metron/0.2.1BETA/config/profiler.properties` and change the period duration to 1 minute.  Also, point the Profiler at the `enrichments` topic to read data directly from the Snort Parser.\r\n  ```\r\n  profiler.input.topic=enrichments\r\n  profiler.period.duration=1\r\n  profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n  ```\r\n3. Follow the Profiler's [Getting Started](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler#getting-started) instructions to start generating profile data.  \r\n\r\n4. Configure the client to read data with a 1 minute period.  To do so, edit `/usr/metron/0.2.1BETA/config/zookeeper/global.properties`.\r\n  ```\r\n  {\r\n    \"es.clustername\": \"metron\",\r\n    \"es.ip\": \"node1\",\r\n    \"es.port\": \"9300\",\r\n    \"es.date.format\": \"yyyy.MM.dd.HH\",\r\n\r\n    \"profiler.client.period.duration\": \"1\",\r\n    \"profiler.client.period.duration.units\": \"MINUTES\"\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n5.  Push the previous global configuration change to Zookeeper.\r\n    ```\r\n    bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i config/zookeeper/ -z node1:2181\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n6. Open up the Stellar shell and use the Profile client to read the data.\r\n  ```\r\n  [root@node1 0.2.1BETA]# bin/stellar -z node1:2181\r\n  Stellar, Go!\r\n  Please note that functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n  {es.clustername=metron, es.ip=node1, es.port=9300, es.date.format=yyyy.MM.dd.HH, profiler.client.hbase.table=profiler,

PR attempts to solve the issue of snort data not flowing after an extended amount of time by removing Flume as a dependency and simplifying the process.  Flume is replaced by a combination of the \"tail\" command and kafka-console-producer, making it much easier to troubleshoot.\n\nThe implementation was inspired by the yaf sensor.  The one significant change is in the \"metron-deployment/roles/snort/templates/snort-producer\" init script.  The yaf init script stops the child processes by name with \"killall\" which doesn't work in this case because \"snort-producer\" is not in the first \"tail\" command.  Instead the process group id is retrieved in line 64 and passed to the \"kill\" command in line 67.\n\nThis has been tested in quick-dev, including managing the sensor through Monit.  I searched for other Flume dependencies but could not find any, therefore Flume was removed completely.

believe this resolves this ticket, but was unable to prove it directly with the provided information.  However, this does solve a specific, input dependent, bug that would result in the described error.\n\nThe original implementation of the comparator was generating microseconds since epoch as Longs from the provided packets (seconds \\* 1000000 + microseconds). While Long is sufficient for holding these values, a narrowing conversion occurs during the intValue() call on the difference.  The problem is that narrowing conversions do not necessarily maintain sign. This can then result in incorrect comparisons and the error seen.  See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.3\n\n> A narrowing conversion of a signed integer to an integral type T simply discards all but the n lowest order bits, where n is the number of bits used to represent type T. In addition to a possible loss of information about the magnitude of the numeric value, this may cause the sign of the resulting value to differ from the sign of the input value.\n\nThe code has been updated and cleaned up a bit to avoid this narrowing conversion and avoid some unnecessary boxing while I was already in the code. Given that it has plain longs, rather than calculate a difference, it just calls `Long.compare()` on the generated microseconds since epoch.  Debug message is modified accordingly to not use the difference anymore, because it's no longer calculated or used.\n\nUnit tests are added, and the original function fails `testLargeDifference()`, while the new one succeeds. This function adds twenty years to the original date, and does a comparison.  `compare(earlier, later)` should return negative, but due to the narrowing conversion actually return positive as demonstrated here:\n\n> p1time:1469521273000000 p2time: 2100673273999999 delta: -631152000999999\n> -631152000999999 - After longValue()\n> 2033081793 - After intValue()\n\nI haven't run this up in a dev environment, given the relatively small size of the change and the ability to directly unit test and prove the error. If anyone wants me to run it up and do more involved testing, I'm happy to do that

to manually test in full-dev, but wanted to get this up for review asap.\r\n\r\nResolves https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-402\r\n\r\nUPDATE 10/25/16 - Tested in full-dev. Tested with incorrect/unparsable timezone and format. Verified configuration logging statements also.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.snort.BasicSnortParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\":\"snort\",\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n      \"dateFormat\" : \"MM/dd/yy-HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS\",\r\n      \"timeZone\" : \"America/New_York\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- Change Snort configuration to include date in the timestamp output\r\n- Fix BasicSnortParser to handle microseconds properly - switched to Java 8's java.time API.\r\n- Added the ability to specify timezone and dateformat configuration to the snort parser. Defaults to system default zone for the ZoneId, MM/dd/yy-HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS for the dateformat. Note the addition of \"yy\" to the dateformat.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\nCan pass in different dateformat and timezone configuration and note the different behavior.\r\nOptions are \"timeZone\" and \"dateFormat\". Valid timezones are per ZoneId.getAvailableZoneIds(). DateFormats should be valid per options here -

pull request is the first version of the REST API.  I intentionally kept it simple by including only one well understood service:  CRUD interface for SensorParserConfigs.  While I feel it's solid (100% test coverage, integration tests that leverages in-memory component testing infrastructure, no PMD warnings, etc), there are several areas that should be reviewed:\n- Maven POM files\n  - Is it consistent with other Metron components?\n  - Are any plugins missing?\n- API structure\n  - what should the paths look like?\n- Project structure\n  - Is the code in the right place?\n- Response behavior\n  - What should clients see on failures?  Should 500 codes be returned?\n\nI'm sure there are other issues I'm not thinking of.  Once we can come to a consensus on this initial PR, other services can be added that follow the same patterns we establish here.\n\nThis can be tested by either running the unit/integration tests or running the service against a vagrant environment.  To do the latter:\n- Build the quick-dev environment\n- Run \"mvn clean package\" from within metron-rest\n- Start the service by running \"java -jar target/metron-rest-0.2.1BETA.jar\"\n- Test the REST service (running \"curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sensorParserConfigs\" should return all the parser configs loaded during the quick-dev build)\n\nThere is much more to do (deployment, packaging, etc) but this should get us started.\n","created_at":"2016-10-19T15:56:14Z","updated_at":"2017-03-02T20:52:01Z","closed_at":"2017-03-02T20:52:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"980564bb2bd751e955f977ac86f63dd8f3feeb74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/316/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/316/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/316/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/52f87fdb80248d5a5eda3d7296956dfd74725ee7","head":{"label":"merrimanr:METRON-503","ref":"METRON-503","sha":"52f87fdb80248d5a5eda3d7296956dfd74725ee7","user":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62420865,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQyMDg2NQ==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"merrimanr/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"merrimanr","id":311928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTkyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/311928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr","html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrimanr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/merrimanr/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

is an attempt to enhance the Integration Test framework to support exposing processor errors and invalid messages.\n\nThere are two goals here:\n1. Expose errors that are in present but not exposed because the kafka queues or other error sources are not check or exposed through the Processor run\n2. Allow the integration tests to fail quicker as opposed to timing out ( if for example there are invalid messages or errors in the kafka queue such that the message in never == message out the test will keep re-trying until timeout ).\n\nA new type ProcessorResult<T> has been added to the system as the return from running a Processor.  This type encapsulates the results, errors and invalids from any given run.\n\nAll integration tests with master run.\n\nAs always any feedback is appreciated.  Specifically in two areas:\n- Is there a better way, or a way more consistent with the system than introducing the ProcessorResult type?\n- The integration project does not have any tests, should it ( unit tests?)\n- What is the best way to test this?  Should each individual test have a 'failure mode' test as well?\n","created_at":"2016-10-16T17:09:18Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T18:59:20Z","closed_at":"2016-10-21T18:33:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8adc4abef609718e0f01f15d8ec2a0c8d346274c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/311/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/311/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/311/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/6512c2e52510a84ed572af677dbcec38403a6af2","head":{"label":"ottobackwards:METRON-502","ref":"METRON-502","sha":"6512c2e52510a84ed572af677dbcec38403a6af2","user":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68852003,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODg1MjAwMw==","name":"metron","full_name":"ottobackwards/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ottobackwards","id":1111551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTE1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobackwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ottobackwards/metron","description":"Mirror

INCOMPLETE DO NOT MERGE ****\\* \n\nPutting the PR out, so people can take a look and potentially fix/improve things.\n\nInitial start at upgrading the Storm version to 1.0.1, and I'm going to hop off of this for right now.  Provided in case anyone wants to take a stab at fixing / cleaning up the various issues with it, and so feedback can be provided. If you do make improvements, feel free to grab the branch and submit a new PR.\n\nWhat changes occurred\n- The move over to org.apache.storm from backtype.storm\n- API changes from byte[] to ByteArray are handled\n- Kafka also updated to 0.10 out of necessity, storm-kafka is still used (storm-kafka-client seemed like significantly more work given the amount of changes to the underpinnings).  I would not expect this to cause issues, given backwards compatibility, but since tests still fail this hasn't been validated.\n- Some of the various classpath issues have been taken care of (things move between jars, and a couple test items now need a test jar which has been pulled in and scoped appropriately on various modules)\n- A couple simple Scala wrappers about some of the Storm Kafka handling in regards to Zookeeper has been added (including to the pom) to avoid having to call direct Scala only testing tools that use pretty Scala specific stuff.  The wrappers just take in the args we were using and use defaults for the rest.\n- Changes to the full dev platform to account for using HDP 2.5 to match the new version.  This is entirely untested given test failures.\n\nWhat works\n- Most unit tests.  Interestingly, metron-platform/metron-management fails on CLI, but succeeds in IntelliJ.  I'm guessing classpath issue as a result of attempting to fix integration tests broke this on the CLI as it used to work, but unsure.\n- Most integration tests. This involved moving.\n\nWhat doesn't work\n- Both some unit and some integration tests\n- Dev platforms are untested.\n\nWhat's left\n- Fixing tests\n- Testing full dev\n- Building quick dev image and testing it\n- End to End testing.  Given the scope of the changes, this needs to be pretty thorough.\n- Ambari MPack testing.\n","created_at":"2016-10-14T21:40:01Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T14:49:44Z","closed_at":"2016-10-24T13:53:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7a27a19186441f2aba0fcecf9c76e89e77f8081","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/f445bfb9fef0583bbce444406227f96a4c506706","head":{"label":"justinleet:storm_1.0","ref":"storm_1.0","sha":"f445bfb9fef0583bbce444406227f96a4c506706","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62403147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQwMzE0Nw==","name":"metron","full_name":"justinleet/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet/metron","description":"Mirror

PR moves Grok patterns from HDFS to a property in Zookeeper (\"SensorParserConfig.parserConfig.grokPattern\").  Most of the important changes were made to the GrokParser class and related tests.  There were 2 primary challenges with implementing this:\n- A change to a Grok pattern in Zookeeper should take effect immediately without a topology restart.  Currently the MessageParser does not have access to the Zookeeper config.\n- Grok patterns must now comply with JSON formatting standards (files had less restrictions)\n\nThe first challenge was solved by changing the MessageParser.parse method to include an additional \"SensorParserConfig\" parameter that the GrokParser can use to determine if the grok pattern has changed and reinit if necessary.  The ParserBolt now passes in the most recent SensorParserConfig to the MessageParser for every message processed.  This is similar to how the writer interfaces work.  I believe this approach is simpler than having the ParserBolt listen for changes and reconfigure/reinit the GrokParser.  Changing this interface makes this PR look much bigger than it actually is because all the parsers and parser tests had to be adjusted.  Most of files included are 1 line changes.\n\nThe second challenge was overcome by using '\\n' to separate lines inside the grok pattern JSON property.  An extra '\\' also had to be added to '\\' escape characters in the grok pattern files.  The advantage of this is that no special serialization/deserialization is needed inside of the GrokParser code.  The disadvantage is that the patterns are not as human-readable.\n\nAll unit tests and integration tests are passing.  I added an extra unit test in SampleGrokParserTest to simulate and test a config being updated.  I also tested yaf and squid sensors in quick-dev by updating the grokPattern properties and verifying the new patterns were applied.

Problem\n\n[METRON-403](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-403)\n\nWhen the Bro DNS logs contain FQDNs in the 'answers' field, writing to the Elasticsearch index fails with the following exception.\n\n```\n2016-09-21 09:13:28.360 o.a.m.w.BulkWriterComponent [ERROR] Failing 5 tuples\njava.lang.Exception: failure in bulk execution:\n[1]: index [bro_index_2016.09.21.09], type [bro_doc], id [AVdMBXQSDU1LLSTQd0pk], message [MapperParsingException[failed to parse [answers]]; nested: IllegalArgumentException[failed to parse ip [clients.l.google.com], not a valid ip address];]\n        at org.apache.metron.elasticsearch.writer.ElasticsearchWriter.write(ElasticsearchWriter.java:173) ~[stormjar.jar:?]\n        at org.apache.metron.writer.BulkWriterComponent.write(BulkWriterComponent.java:108) [stormjar.jar:?]\n        at org.apache.metron.writer.bolt.BulkMessageWriterBolt.execute(BulkMessageWriterBolt.java:98) [stormjar.jar:?]\n        at \n```\n### Solution\n\nThe template for the Bro index is constructed expecting that the 'answers' field is one or more IPv4 addresses. This is not always the case.  The field is [described as a vector of strings](https://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/protocols/dns/main.bro.html#type-DNS::Info) and can include an IPv4, IPv6 or a hostname depending on the type of DNS response message.  \n\n```\n{\"dns\": {\"uid\": \"C05DzHkyLOXv22Cgl\", ..., \"answers\": [\"daysofyorr.com\", \"50.28.53.156\"], ...}\n```\n\nI altered the default Elasticsearch Bro index template to expect a string, rather than simply IPv4. This has no impact to Metron's default dashboard.\n### Testing\n\nThis change was tested by running an end-to-end test on the \"Quick Dev\"

[METRON-490](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-490)\n\nCurrently, each Stellar function handles validation of required function parameters in its own way.  In some cases, we have functions that throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException, in other cases the function will produce its own error message and exception.\n\nThere needs to be a standard mechanism to validate required function parameters.  This mechanism should handle missing parameters gracefully and provide an error message that makes sense to a user.  The handling should be accessible across all functions.\n### Changes\n- Added an additional Stellar annotation called `requiredParams`.  \n- Added a method to `BaseStellarFunction.validate` to validate the `requiredParams`.\n- Use of the annotation field and validation mechanism is optional.\n- Modified the Stellar STATS_\\* functions to use this functionality.\n- If an incorrect type is specified, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a message like \n  `\n  SOME_FUNCTION: unexpected parameter [2]: expected class java.lang.Integer, actual class java.lang.String`\n  `\n- If a required parameter is missing, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a message like:\n  `\n  SOME_FUNCTION: parameter missing [2]: expected class java.lang.Integer\n

Stellar IS_EMPTY validation to handle empty and null\n\nAddresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-439\n\nThings have changed a bit since the original Jira was filed. Most notably, this error appears while dumping config from Zookeeper after it has already been loaded. The current functionality/validation would not have allowed the load to succeed in the first place. Even so, empty and null checks could be handled more gracefully. This PR changes IS_EMPTY to return true on null or empty string rather than throw an exception.\n\nAdded new unit tests and validated on quick-dev with multiple bro messages - normal host, empty host string, and null/non-existent host string.\n","created_at":"2016-10-06T17:13:10Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T14:57:18Z","closed_at":"2016-10-11T14:57:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"24427b88326e105b9a996d1db7c5d826f5e42ef5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/296/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/296/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/296/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/bd6e1a5cc48962af36b131e189ffb461e836cd20","head":{"label":"mmiklavc:METRON-439","ref":"METRON-439","sha":"bd6e1a5cc48962af36b131e189ffb461e836cd20","user":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58224042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODIyNDA0Mg==","name":"metron","full_name":"mmiklavc/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mmiklavc","id":658443,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODQ0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/658443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc","html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmiklavc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mmiklavc/metron","description":"Mirror

Changes\n\nThese changes were required to make the Stellar Profiler Client API accessible from the Parser and Enrichment topologies.\n- Refactored the Profiler into three projects.  \n  - This dramatically helps with the clashing dependencies between Storm and HBase when the Profiler Client API is added to Enrichment.\n  - `metron-profiler-common` - Contains all code shared between the Profiler topology and client\n  - `metron-profiler` - Contains the topology used to build Profiles.\n  - `metron-profiler-client` - The client API used to access Profile data.\n- Added the `metron-profiler-client` as a dependency to `metron-parser` and `metron-enrichment`.  This allows Profile data to be accessed from both the Parser and Enrichment topologies.\n- Added a README for the `metron-profiler-client` to describe its usage.\n- Pushing the `metron-profiler-client` archive to the Metron host to make the library accessible to the Stellar Shell.\n- Fixed an issue with potentially unsafe String to Byte conversion that may cause issues on different platforms.\n- All \"uber JARs\" now use the naming convention \"[project]-[version]-uber.jar\".  This included updates to Parsers, Elasticsearch, and Solr JARs.\n  - These projects did not have <shadedClassifierName>uber</shadedClassifierName> set. The dependencies coming from those projects would not show-up when running `mvn dependency:tree`. Once I turned that on so that I could actually see the dependencies being pulled in, the non-uber jars would be deployed and so nothing would actually work. These changes ensure that when troubleshooting you can actually see the dependencies and the right jar actually gets deployed.\n### Testing\n\nBeyond the unit and integration tests, these changes were tested in the 'Quick Dev' environment.\n- [x] Deployed, stopped, started, and validated the Parser topology using Snort and Bro\n- [x] Deployed, stopped, started, and validated the Enrichment topology\n- [x] Deployed, stopped, started, and validated the Indexing topology\n- [x] Deployed, stopped, started, and validated the Profiler topology\n- [x] Used the Profiler Client API to retrieve Profile data\n- [x] Validated full end-to-end automated deployment with 'Quick Dev'\n- [x] Build and Install Metron with RPMs \n- [x] Build Metron Ambari MPack\n\nThese changes can be manually tested by following the 'Getting Started' instructions included in both the `metron-profiler/README.md` and

facilitate partial successes writing in Elasticsearch (i.e. subset of Tuples succeeds and another subset fails), the BulkMessageWriter.write() now returns a BulkWriterResponse object which contains both the successful and failed Tuples (So that we know which ones to ack successfully and which to send to the error stream).\n\nElasticsearchWriter has been modified to be able to take advantage of partial writes.  The other implementations of the BulkWriter have only been affected to produce total success at the end of their methods (which is the same functionality previously implied by not hitting an Exception.\n\nUnit tests have been added for the ElasticsearchWriter writers implementation of the partial successes and failures, along with modifying existing tests elsewhere to account for the BulkWriterResponse.\n\nOne question I'd like resolved in review, is where to actually place the BulkWriterResponse in the code hierarchy.  It's obviously closely tied to the BulkMessageWriter (really only existing to add functionality to it), but that lives in an interface package and BWR is a concrete class. If there are opinions on where that should live, I'm happy to move it and update the PR.\n","created_at":"2016-09-30T12:13:42Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T14:50:00Z","closed_at":"2016-10-11T15:13:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f77920810e9404ea1646952eaab9e400d4bbd56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/8ab4131fa3bfd80f87e0edc851ce7e0f23e2148c","head":{"label":"justinleet:es_error_handling","ref":"es_error_handling","sha":"8ab4131fa3bfd80f87e0edc851ce7e0f23e2148c","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62403147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQwMzE0Nw==","name":"metron","full_name":"justinleet/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet/metron","description":"Mirror
