patch starts by adding \"batchTimeout\" essentially every place \"batchSize\" is used.  Since the configuration-related classes are many-layered, this addition is trivial in many cases.\r\n\r\nThe flush-on-timeout logic is fairly straightforward. It was implemented by a refactoring of `BulkWriterComponent` to extract an explicit \"flush\" from the \"write\" logic, and then call flush from Tick Tuple processing in `BulkMessageWriterBolt`.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part was figuring out the appropriate setting for `topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs` if the administrator configures non-default batchTimeouts. It is necessary to enumerate the batchTimeout settings for all configured sensorNames, which is implemented in `IndexingConfigurations::getAllConfiguredTimeouts()`. Then multiple other factors must be taken into account to determine the allowed and recommended settings, which is implemented in `BatchTimeoutHelper`. If there are better ways to accomplish these things, please share your ideas.\r\n\r\nFor test and review, it may be useful to know that the default value of `batchTimeout`, and hence for `topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs`, is 14 seconds (which is the default value of `topology.message.timeout.secs` (30 sec) / 2 - 1).\r\n\r\nTo unit test this feature, we added `Clock` logic and implemented a writable `FakeClock`.  This may be generally useful for testing other time-based behavior as we add such functionality.\r\n\r\nAll configuration issues were done in such a way as to default to \"good\" behavior, with no changes needed in current configs of previously installed systems.  In fact, recommended configuration is to leave batchTimeout unconfigured, or set it to zero, thereby accepting the system calculated default.\r\n\r\nAfter this patch is reviewed and accepted, similar work needs to be done for the `ParserWriter`, and possibly other sub-components.  That will be in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to split this patch into sections related to each of sub-tasks METRON-516, METRON-577, METRON-329 and METRON-330.  Let me know if you would like me to do so.  In the past, people seem to prefer to see a whole feature development in one PR, even though it gets a little long, so that's the way I'm submitting this one, for now.\r\n\r\nTest Plan is appended below.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

As part of code review, please provide your opinion on whether the provided unit tests are adequate, or what additional test cases should be added.\r\n\r\nI enlarged the elasticsearch values for batchSize and batchTimeout in metron-integration-test/src/main/config/indexing/test.json, and mocked procedures in the unit tests that test the following cases:\r\n\r\n1. Test that flush on batchSize continues to work correctly, without time-based triggers going off.\r\n1. Test that flush occurs on less-than-full queue, when a message comes in and the queue is older than batchTimeout.  (Age of the queue is determined as currentTime() - timeOfEnqueingFirstMsg().)\r\n1. Test that flush occurs on less-than-full queue, when a TickTuple comes in and the queue is older than batchTimeout.\r\n1. Test that default batchTimeout is correctly calculated as (TOPOLOGY_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_SECS / 2 / batchTimeoutDivisor - 1).\r\n1. Test that when default batchTimeout is smaller than configured batchTimeout, that the default is used.\r\n1. Test that when default batchTimeout is greater than configured batchTimeout, that the configured batchTimeout is used.\r\n\r\nAll of the above test cases are tested, with mocked writers and a FakeClock, in the BulkMessageWriterBoltTest unit test file, with the latest commits.\r\n\r\n### Manual End-to-End Testing\r\nManual end-to-end testing, if you are so moved, consists of six scenarios for a given sensor queue:\r\n1. Under **heavy continuous load** the batchSize still controls flushing behavior, because the queue size always exceeds batchSize before queue age exceeds batchTimeout.\r\n2. Under **light continuous load**, where each queue continues to receive at least one message per second, and batchSize is large enough it is never exceeded, then the batchTimeout for each queue should control flushing behavior within +/- 1 sec, because each new message triggers a check of the queue age and potential timeout flush.\r\n  - NOTE: If the configured batchTimeout is set to a large number, bigger than `1/2 topology.message.timeout.secs - 1` (which equals **14 sec** by default), then it will be replaced by an effective value equal to `1/2 topology.message.timeout.secs - 1`.  Flushing will occur within +/- 1 sec of each _effective_ batchTimeout interval, rather than the _configured_ batchTimeout interval.\r\n3. Under **light intermittent load**, where less than batchSize messages queue up, and gaps between messages may exceed the timeout interval, then age checks and potential flush events may be triggered by _either_ incoming messages or TickTuple events, depending on the phase relationship between intermittent bursts of messages, and the TickTuple system tick.  The TickTuple interval is guaranteed to be < `1/2 topology.message.timeout.secs`, hence the default TickTuple interval is 14 seconds.  But if the smallest batchTimeout configured for any sensor queue on the Bolt is < the default TickTuple interval, then that smallest value becomes the actual TickTuple interval.  This produces three sub-cases, all of which guarantee a flush event before any message gets recycled due to aging past `topology.message.timeout.secs`:\r\n  - If the queue's configured batchTimeout is the smallest (or only) such on this Bolt, and that number is smaller than the default TickTuple interval, then it _becomes_ the actual TickTuple interval.  The queue is guaranteed to flush between 1x and 2x this interval.\r\n  - If the queue's configured batchTimeout is not the smallest such, but still is < the default TickTuple interval, then the queue is guaranteed to flush between its own `configured batchTimeout` and its `configured batchTimeout + actual TickTuple interval` (which is less than 2x its own `configured batchTimeout`).\r\n  - If the queue's configured batchTimeout is > the default TickTuple interval (14 sec default), then its effective batchTimeout is set to the default TickTuple interval.  The queue is guaranteed to flush between this `effective batchTimeout` and its `effective batchTimeout + actual TickTuple interval`.\r\n\r\nThe upshot is that:\r\n* \"Configured batchTimeout\" should be thought of as \"minimum age before you'll allow a time-based flush\" (capped by default TickTuple interval, aka 1/2 `topology.message.timeout.secs`)\r\n* \"Actual TickTuple interval\" is the \"maximum time between age checks\".  It will be <= all the configured batchTimeouts for the various sensors on the Bolt.\r\n* When a flush actually happens may be up to \"effective batchTimeout\" + \"actual TickTuple interval\", depending on exactly when intermittent message events and periodic Tick events happen.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-16T20:27:24Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T01:38:38Z","closed_at":"2017-08-11T01:38:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e3d1499afc4f37e4f6459a0a83687a6c0a84946","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/433eb2e75c628944ff3ba0f85bed43cb3e50ada3","head":{"label":"mattf-apache:METRON-322","ref":"METRON-322","sha":"433eb2e75c628944ff3ba0f85bed43cb3e50ada3","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69620284,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTYyMDI4NA==","name":"metron","full_name":"mattf-apache/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache/metron","description":"Mirror

Summary\r\nFollowing Ryan's work in https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/453, we have the opportunity to present errors from our topologies.\r\n\r\nIt's nothing too complicated, essentially just some high level overviews of the various error fields, along with a pane for viewing the actual errors along with all their fields.  Note that they include both raw and unique message counts (via the hash fields) in most things.\r\n\r\nThis also corrects the error_index.template files.  These are supposed to match ErrorFields in Constants.java, but didn't.\r\n\r\nI've attached some screenshots, and this can be spun up on quick dev and Ambari (both dashboard.p and the various kibana-index.json are updated).  Quick dev automatically passes some data through, so it's a good way to get this spun up with something interesting showing.\r\n\r\nFeedback on what else would be useful and if we want to adjust anything would be great.  Keep in mind, we don't actually have a lot of fields to work with (because if everything was good, we wouldn't be here in the first place!). See error_index.template for the fields we have.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nSpun up in quick-dev and Ambari.  Quick-dev will automatically put data through\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n* I'm really not convinced the 'hostname' visualizations are needed.  The field is there and useful, but given that it's populated with the Storm host that failed, it seems like it's probably useless most of the time.\r\n* Kibana occasionally rearranges the order of the visualizations (usually swapping a couple of the charts). \r\n If I recall correctly, that's a known Kibana bug that we're stuck with.\r\n* Keep in mind the graph shifts by the viewing window.  So last 15 minutes vs last 7 days all updates accordingly.\r\n* This includes a fix to maps mentioned in https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/436.  If that PR goes in before this one, this PR should be take it's own copy of the dashboards.  If this PR goes in first, that PR should accept this one's dashboards.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-06 at 11 22 20 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5077341/23672488/e5ae6c9a-033c-11e7-834d-caab26497f0e.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-06 at 11 22 28 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5077341/23672512/f3ceec5a-033c-11e7-946f-f7d279a4f3b0.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1439\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-06 at 11 22 37 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5077341/23672513/f58b317a-033c-11e7-8a21-b1a927971bba.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1439\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-03-06 at 11 22 45 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5077341/23672514/f6b6ee90-033c-11e7-9630-0143f2f31fcd.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bottom pane extends further down, but we've all seen a table of data before.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).\r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.\r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification guildlines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description\r\nWith the current implementation of Stellar, we cannot cache the parse tree and then apply it after the fact. It's just an artifact of how we do the parsing: we actually execute the statement as we parse rather than constructing an AST that can then be evaluated later given a message. Essentially what I'm proposing is that we build the equivalent of Pattern.compile() in Java except for Stellar.\r\nWe should for multiple reasons:\r\n* code clarity - decoupling the stellar language from the generated parser code\r\n* performance - saving lexing and parsing for every message.  Also, the resulting parse-stack may be much smaller than the somewhat complex.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I have added a google cache that will cache the resulting compiled expression in `BaseStellarProcessor` for 10 minutes (by default).  I have also created a microbenchmarking suite and have evaluated this on a few representative expressions.\r\nResults:\r\n* `TO_UPPER('casey')`\r\n  * Median ms before: `880.5`\r\n  * Median ms after: `15`\r\n  * Speedup: 58.6x faster\r\n* `TO_LOWER(name)`\r\n  * Median ms before: `497`\r\n  * Median ms after: `3`\r\n  * Speedup: 165.6x faster\r\n* `1 + 2*(3 + int_num) / 10.0`\r\n  * Median ms before: `676`\r\n  * Median ms after: `4`\r\n  * Speedup: 169x faster\r\n* `1.5 + 2*(3 + double_num) / 10.0`\r\n  * Median ms before: `634`\r\n  * Median ms after: `1`\r\n  * Speedup: 634x faster\r\n* `if ('foo' in ['foo']) OR one == very_nearly_one then 'one' else 'two'`\r\n  * Median ms before: `616`\r\n  * Median ms after: `23`\r\n  * Speedup: 26x faster\r\n* `1 + 2*(3 + int_num) / 10.0`\r\n  * Median ms before: `601`\r\n  * Median ms after: `2`\r\n  * Speedup: 300.5x faster\r\n* `DOMAIN_TO_TLD(domain)`\r\n  * Median ms before: `505`\r\n  * Median ms after: `16`\r\n  * Speedup: 32.5x\r\n* `DOMAIN_REMOVE_SUBDOMAINS(domain)`\r\n  * Median ms before: `496`\r\n  * Median ms after: `11`\r\n  * Speedup: 45x faster\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing Plan\r\nPlease refer to the METRON-744 [PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/468#issue-210707129) testing plan.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).\r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.\r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification guildlines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book? If not then run the following commands and the verify changes via site-book/target/site/index.html.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd site-book\r\nbin/generate-md.sh\r\nmvn site:site\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\nIt is also recommended that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) is set up for your personal repository such that your branches are built there before submitting a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributor Comments\r\nDuring my review I identified two separate issues which I documented in [METRON-753](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-753) and [METRON-754](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-754).  The primary fix here are that the links under the Metron API documentation that contain {name} now work in GitHub md but are still broken in our generated

DO NOT MERGE\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nBased on Ryan's work in https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/453, I went ahead and created some a Kibana dashboard for tracking errors.  **That PR is not finalized in master so this should not be merged!** However, the data flowing to the index is pretty final, so unless the actual fields or field names change, it doesn't really affect this.\r\n\r\nAll we care about here is the dashboard itself, but unfortunately the 453 changes get pulled along for the ride until that's in.\r\n\r\nIt's nothing too complicated, essentially just some high level overviews of the various fields output by Ryan (some counts, etc.), along with a pane for viewing the actual errors along with all their fields.  Note that they include both raw and unique message counts (via the hash fields) in most things.\r\n\r\nI've attached some screenshots, but this can be also be spun up on an Ambari cluster (and will eventually have to be to be validated, given that the file isn't in a readable format).\r\n\r\nI'm basically looking for feedback on what else would be useful and if we want to adjust anything.  Keep in mind, we don't actually have a lot of fields to work with (because if everything was good, we wouldn't be here in the first place!). See error_index.template for the fields we have.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n* I'm really not convinced the 'hostname' visualizations are needed.  The field is there and useful, but given that it's populated with the Storm host that failed, it seems like it's probably useless most of the time.\r\n* Kibana occasionally rearranges the order of the visualizations (usually swapping a couple of the charts).  If I recall correctly, that's a known Kibana bug that we're stuck with.\r\n* The graph teaches a lesson of \"Don't load all your data at once if you want a pretty graph\". Still, it's just a basic graph of the error counts over time.\r\n* Keep in mind the graph shifts by the viewing window.  So last 15 minutes vs last 7 days all updates accordingly.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"errordashboard_top\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5077341/23518699/52eb58bc-ff42-11e6-912c-cc596fe46a3d.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1436\" alt=\"errordashboard_middle\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5077341/23518700/549c3f0a-ff42-11e6-8e26-18553ce804bc.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"errordashboard_bottom\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5077341/23518702/5605c69a-ff42-11e6-8c76-15f485253e8f.png\">\r\n\r\nThe bottom pane extends further down, but we've all seen a table of data before.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description\r\nThe benefit of Stellar is that adding new functionality is as simple as providing a Jar. This enables people who want to integrate with Metron to easy add enrichments or other functionality. The snag currently with this is that we provide a single jar, so all stellar functions that we have available must be dependencies of the main jar that drives the topology plus what local directories we can configure via the storm configs. This makes the process of adding 3rd party jars not as easy as it could be.\r\nAdjust the the following to additionally load classes from a location in HDFS /apps/metron/stellar using something like accumulo ( https://accumulo.apache.org/blog/2014/05/03/accumulo-classloader.html)\r\n* Profiler topology\r\n* Parser topology\r\n* Enrichment topology\r\n* Enrichment Flat file loader\r\n* Enrichment MR loader\r\n* The REPL\r\n\r\nOne thing to note about this PR is that we shift the way that we load classes from the classpath.  We now use [ClassIndex](https://github.com/atteo/classindex) instead of Reflections.  This means that stellar classes are found by analyzing a file dropped in META-INF.  This has a couple of advantages:\r\n* Blazing fast function loading because we're iterating over every jar, not every class.  So fast, there is no noticeable delay for me in starting the REPL.\r\n* Reflections had some serious issues with non-default classloaders that we ran into\r\n\r\nFor the Stellar function author, this has no impact to you.  You just use the annotation and make sure to depend on metron-common (provided dependency) and the file in META-INF is automatically added.\r\n\r\n# Testing Plan\r\n## Preliminaries\r\n\r\nAlso, set an environment variable to indicate `METRON_HOME`:\r\n* `export METRON_HOME=/usr/metron/0.3.1` \r\n\r\n### Setup Classpath \r\n* As the hdfs user, create a directory in HDFS for the stellar function\r\n  jars:\r\n`hadoop fs -mkdir /apps/metron/stellar`\r\n* Place [custom-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar](https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron/blob/5c50cf5e4b1d53383c1d5d724dd0d20983f16cb8/metron-platform/metron-common/src/test/classpath-resources/custom-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar?raw=true) in /apps/metron/stellar\r\n* Edit `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json` and add the following properties:\r\n```\r\n\"stellar.function.paths\" : \"hdfs://node1:8020/apps/metron/stellar/.*.jar\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Set-up the Profiler\r\n\r\n* Create the profiler hbase table\r\n`echo \"create 'profiler', 'P'\" | hbase shell`\r\n\r\n* Open `~/rand_gen.py` and paste the following:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/python\r\nimport random\r\nimport sys\r\nimport time\r\ndef main():\r\n  mu = float(sys.argv[1])\r\n  sigma = float(sys.argv[2])\r\n  freq_s = int(sys.argv[3])\r\n  while True:\r\n    out = '{ \"value\" : ' + str(random.gauss(mu, sigma)) + ' }'\r\n    print out\r\n    sys.stdout.flush()\r\n    time.sleep(freq_s)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n  main()\r\n```\r\nThis will generate random JSON maps with a numeric field called `value`\r\n\r\n* Set the profiler to use 1 minute tick durations:\r\n  * Edit `$METRON_HOME/config/profiler.properties` to adjust the capture duration by changing `profiler.period.duration=15` to `profiler.period.duration=1`\r\n  * Edit `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json` and add the following properties:\r\n```\r\n\"profiler.client.period.duration\" : \"1\",\r\n\"profiler.client.period.duration.units\" : \"MINUTES\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Free Up Space on the virtual machine\r\n\r\nFirst, let's free up some headroom on the virtual machine.  If you are running this on a\r\nmultinode cluster, you would not have to do this.\r\n* Kill monit via `service monit stop`\r\n* Kill tcpreplay via `for i in $(ps -ef | grep tcpreplay | awk '{print $2}');do kill -9 $i;done`\r\n* Kill existing parser topologies via \r\n   * `storm kill snort`\r\n   * `storm kill bro`\r\n* Kill yaf via `for i in $(ps -ef | grep yaf | awk '{print $2}');do kill -9 $i;done`\r\n* Kill bro via `for i in $(ps -ef | grep bro | awk '{print $2}');do kill -9 $i;done`\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\nLet's design a multi-component test with a parser, stellar enrichment,\r\nprofiler, and REPL component.\r\n\r\n### Parser\r\n* Create a new parser called `dummy` by editing `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/parsers/dummy.json`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.json.JSONMapParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\":\"dummy\",\r\n  \"fieldTransformations\" : [\r\n    {\r\n    \"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\r\n   ,\"output\" : [ \"parser_right_now\", \"parser_my_name\", \"parser_value_abs\", \"parser_mean\" ]\r\n   ,\"config\" : {\r\n\"parser_right_now\" : \"NOW()\",\r\n\"parser_my_name\" : \"TO_UPPER('casey')\",\r\n\"parser_value_abs\" : \"ABS(value)\",\r\n\"parser_mean\" : \"STATS_MEAN(STATS_MERGE(PROFILE_GET('stat', 'global', PROFILE_WINDOW('from 5 minutes ago'))))\"\r\n               }\r\n    }\r\n                           ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Enrichment\r\n* Edit the value enrichment config at `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/enrichments/dummy.json`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"enrichment\" : {\r\n   \"fieldMap\": {\r\n      \"stellar\" : {\r\n        \"config\" : {\r\n\"enr_right_now\" : \"NOW()\",\r\n\"enr_my_name\" : \"TO_UPPER('casey')\",\r\n\"enr_value_abs\" : \"ABS(value)\",\r\n\"enr_mean\" : \"STATS_MEAN(STATS_MERGE(PROFILE_GET('stat', 'global', PROFILE_WINDOW('from 5 minutes ago'))))\",\r\n\"is_alert\" : \"true\"\r\n                  }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"threatIntel\" : {\r\n    \"triageConfig\" : {\r\n      \"riskLevelRules\" : [\r\n        {\r\n          \"rule\" : \"NOW() > 0\",\r\n          \"score\" : 10\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Profiler\r\n* Edit the value enrichment config at `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"now\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n      \"onlyif\": \"true\",\r\n      \"init\" : {\r\n               },\r\n      \"update\": {\r\n        \"right_now\" : \"NOW()\"\r\n                },\r\n      \"result\": \"right_now\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"stat\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n      \"onlyif\": \"true\",\r\n      \"init\" : {\r\n               },\r\n      \"update\": {\r\n        \"s\": \"STATS_ADD(s, value)\"\r\n                },\r\n      \"result\": \"s\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Start Test\r\n* Push the configs via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper -z node1:2181`\r\n* Create the dummy kafka topic:\r\n  `/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --create --topic dummy --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1`\r\n* `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_profiler_topology.sh`\r\n* Bounce the enrichment topology:\r\n`storm kill enrichment && sleep 20 && $METRON_HOME/bin/start_enrichment_topology.sh`\r\n* Start via `$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k node1:6667 -z node1:2181 -s dummy`\r\n* Send some synthetic data directly to the profiler:\r\n`python ~/rand_gen.py 0 1 1 | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic dummy`\r\n* Wait for at least 10 minutes and execute the following via the Stellar REPL started as `$METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z node1`:\r\n```\r\n# Grab the profiles from 3 minutes ago til now\r\nSTATS_MEAN(STATS_MERGE(PROFILE_GET('stat', 'global', PROFILE_WINDOW('from 3 minutes ago'))))\r\n# Now let us try to run the NOW function, which we added:\r\nNOW()\r\n# Looks like I got a timestamp\r\n# Now pull some profiles where we store them\r\nPROFILE_GET('now', 'global', PROFILE_WINDOW('from 3 minutes ago'))\r\n```\r\nFor me, the following was the result:\r\n```\r\nStellar, Go!\r\nPlease note that functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n{es.clustername=metron, es.ip=node1, es.port=9300, es.date.format=yyyy.MM.dd.HH, stellar.function.paths=hdfs://node1:8020/apps/metron/stellar/.*.jar, profiler.client.period.duration=1, profiler.client.period.duration.units=MINUTES}\r\n[Stellar]>>> #

Upon completion, you should see multiple files named with relatively current datestamps in your current directory, e.g. pcap-data-20160617160549737+0000.pcap\r\n* Copy the files to your local machine and verify you can them it in Wireshark. I chose a middle file and the last file. The middle file should have 500 records (per the records_per_file option), and the last one will likely have a number of records <= 500.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

we be concerned this implies that the testing done on 690 is voided, this was due to the removal of the `NOW` lexical token, which was unused in the grammar, along with a really dumb refactoring mistake changing \"parse\" to \"processing\" that only hit generated code.  The unit tests, etc. ran the code in this PR since it was generated as part of the build.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to an interesting question that we might want to discuss.  Early on, we decided to submit generated code to ease potential issues around pulling code into IDEs (generated code means we don't have to either remind people to rerun `mvn generate-sources` or to instruct their IDEs to regenerate sources automatically).  Maybe we should revisit that point, but I don't know, it's just a thought.","created_at":"2017-02-26T04:38:21Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T14:13:35Z","closed_at":"2017-02-27T14:13:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"266c8b12b41e3645dac99dea61ecaac508e66d20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/57928349c9a5e0af9653c694672decc590b4e590","head":{"label":"cestella:METRON-742","ref":"METRON-742","sha":"57928349c9a5e0af9653c694672decc590b4e590","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47701789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzcwMTc4OQ==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"cestella/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

The contract is that the REST service exposes an endpoint `/apply` and returns back JSON maps with a single key `is_malicious` which can be `malicious` or `legit`.\r\n\r\n## Deploy Mock DGA Service via MaaS\r\n\r\nNow let's start MaaS and deploy the Mock DGA Service:\r\n- Create a `log4j.properties` in `/root` that looks like\r\n```\r\nlog4j.rootLogger=ERROR,stdout\r\nlog4j.threshhold=ALL\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %-5p [%t] %c{2} (%F:%M(%L)) - %m%n\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.filter.1=org.apache.log4j.varia.StringMatchFilter\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.filter.1.StringToMatch=ExpiredTokenRemover\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.filter.1.AcceptOnMatch=false\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.filter.2=org.apache.log4j.varia.StringMatchFilter\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.filter.2.StringToMatch=interrupted\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.filter.2.AcceptOnMatch=false\r\n```\r\n- Start MaaS via `$METRON_HOME/bin/maas_service.sh -zq node1:2181 -l /root/log4j.properties` and verify you do not see something like:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/maas_service.sh -zq node1:2181 -l ~/log4j.properties\r\n17/02/24 20:17:55 INFO impl.TimelineClientImpl: Timeline service address: http://node1:8188/ws/v1/timeline/\r\n17/02/24 20:17:55 INFO service.Client: Initializing Client\r\n```\r\n- Start one instance of the mock DGA model with 512M of memory via `$METRON_HOME/bin/maas_deploy.sh -zq node1:2181 -lmp /root/mock_dga -hmp /user/root/models -mo ADD -m 512 -n dga -v 1.0 -ni 1 -l /root/log4j.properties` and verify that you see no output to stdout or stderr.\r\n- Ensure that the model is running via `$METRON_HOME/bin/maas_deploy.sh -zq node1:2181 -mo LIST -l /root/log4j.properties`.  You should see something like:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/maas_deploy.sh -zq node1:2181 -mo LIST -l ./log4j.properties                                   \r\nModel dga @ 1.0\r\ndga:1.0 @ http://node1:39406 serving:\r\n        apply=apply\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

create the original problem, just run up a parser and make sure there's no geo data on hdfs (by default in /apps/metron/geo).\r\n\r\nThis PR removes geo from metron-parsers entirely (since it shouldn't be necessary at all, only pulled in when Stellar cares about it).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTo validate this, I basically ran through the squid demo with the geo file missing, which works as expected (no exception thrown).  In addition, the ParserBoltTest is updated to not have a reference to the test Geo DB data (and runs fine without it).\r\n\r\nTo ensure that Stellar GEO_GET works as expected in a parser, quick-dev was spun up.  The steps for squid were followed, but with a custom parser config\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.GrokParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"squid\",\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n    \"grokPath\": \"/patterns/squid\",\r\n    \"patternLabel\": \"SQUID_DELIMITED\",\r\n    \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"fieldTransformations\" : [\r\n    {\r\n      \"transformation\" : \"STELLAR\"\r\n    ,\"output\" : [ \"geo_test\" ]\r\n    ,\"config\" : {\r\n      \"geo_test\" : \"GEO_GET(ip_dst_addr)\"\r\n                }\r\n    }\r\n                           ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither update global.json with a valid geo.hdfs.file or run `/usr/metron/0.3.1/bin/geo_enrichment_load.sh -z node1:2181 -r /apps/metron/geo/default/` to place the file in the default spot (instead of a timestamped stop). This is necessary to ensure that the push doesn't clobber geo configs.\r\n\r\nThe resulting data in the index includes\r\n```\r\n{\r\n...\r\n               \"geo_test\": {\r\n

Summary\r\nAn initial attempt to add checkstyle expanded a bit once it turned out that `mvn site` appears to not work right now (and probably hasn't for a long while). More background on some of the issues encountered (and error traces) is in the ticket itself.\r\n\r\nA small set of cleanups is included here, and is pretty easy to split out if we want it to be separate PRs (it mostly just got cleaned up while I was trying to fix things one by one, but for example, checkstyle could be included in a separate PR). It's small enough though, that I just left it together since it makes the generated site fairly nice and complete.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The major change is to drop EMMA for JaCoCo. As noted in the ticket, it's unlikely to be worth the erffort to get EMMA working, given that it's not actively developed and it seems likely that EMMA just isn't compatible with Java 8 code (not terribly surprising given how old it is). I put in JaCoCo mostly to keep (make?) code coverage available, but I can easily remove it if we'd rather have a discussion on a different tool, or just a separate PR.\r\n- Added maven-site-plugin to top level pom\r\n- Refactored most reporting (maven-project-info-reports-plugin, maven-pmd-plugin, and code coverage) to go through top level pom, given that most of our reporting is exactly the same throughout the child poms.\r\n- Explicitly setup up maven-project-info-report-plugin reports (neither CLI param nor POM param skipped dependency reports correctly. Unsure why that is. If someone knows, I'd love to just change that)\r\n- Added maven-jxr-plugin to fix warnings in the site build\r\n- Added names to poms to make sure they show up nicely in site\r\n- Deploy set to /tmp/metron/site for now. Should eventually be adjusted to be somewhere useful (I believe other components like Hadoop do something nicer with it within Apache, but I'd need to look into it). I'll create a ticket for it, assuming we're good with this PR (mostly) as-is. Otherwise, I'll wait and see what spins out of discussion here.\r\n- Updated PMD to 3.7\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\nTo run everything, including code coverage up:\r\n~`mvn clean install site:site site:deploy site:stage-deploy`~\r\n`mvn clean install && mvn site site:stage-deploy site:deploy`\r\n\r\nOpen up /tmp/metron/site/index.html in a browser. Everything (other than Javadoc) should be available, and clicking through modules should work because of the `site:stage-deploy`\r\n\r\nSkipping tests allows code coverage to be skipped.\r\n\r\nI also ran up quick-dev and made sure data passed through topologies. I didn't run up other components, because mostly the reporting section of the poms is touched, so if they built and the reporting built it seemed like enough. I can definitely spin up other components if anybody wants to be more thorough, though.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n- Javadocs are currently broken outside of this ticket. Separate Jira/PR is open for that issue.\r\n- Reason for `site:stage-deploy` to is get the parent-child pom links working while testing. Otherwise, you can't navigate through the module structure.\r\n- Currently almost 25k(!) checkstyle issues.\r\n- It's possible to import a check style file in IntelliJ. I could export this for general use (modified it to use two spaces + possibly things like line length). I tested reformatting all Java files like this, and it clears out several thousand checkstyle issues. And makes the code more consistent. Obviously, that's a bit aggressive and touched things like autogenerated files, but it makes it clear we have more issues than trivially solved by code formatting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-20T06:23:32Z","updated_at":"2017-10-17T13:55:37Z","closed_at":"2017-05-02T22:18:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7adfb0db95a9380261fd8044d320825b53da2de3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/c2af1932f00d33347195b4fd22a987a7671145e4","head":{"label":"justinleet:site_fix","ref":"site_fix","sha":"c2af1932f00d33347195b4fd22a987a7671145e4","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62403147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQwMzE0Nw==","name":"metron","full_name":"justinleet/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet/metron","description":"Mirror

PR addresses METRON-695, including updates to the Ambari MPack.  A summary of the changes:\r\n\r\n- Defaulted FieldValidator.input to empty list\r\n- Added MetronError abstraction, updated ErrorUtils\r\n- Added MetronGetStrategy abstraction\r\n- Updated Constants to only have 1 error topic and added error field and error type enums\r\n- Updated flux property files for enrichment and indexing topologies to send errors to single error topic\r\n- Added new error topology including start script, index zookeeper config, flux file and flux property file\r\n- Updated integration tests with single error topic and error handling test cases where applicable\r\n- Updated unit tests to cover new error handling code\r\n- Removed invalid data fields, invalid is considered error now\r\n- Exposed Kafka offset as a parameter in ParserTopologyComponent\r\n- Added error indexing topology to Ambari MPack\r\n\r\nThere are 2 areas of review that I would like to highlight.  The first is the abstraction for handling errors in the various Metron topologies.  Error handling logic is not consistent across topologies, ranging from calling the ErrorUtils.handleError method to simply logging the exception.  The ErrorUtils.handleError was the most common method used so I decided to extend that to accommodate other bolts and topologies.  As I worked through the details I found myself either having to add several additional ErrorUtils.handleError methods to cover all the different combinations of error message properties or creating several empty Optional objects, making the code more verbose and confusing than it should be.  So I moved the error message generating logic previously in ErrorUtils.generateErrorMessage to a separate MetronError class that follows a builder/fluent design pattern.  With this change, capturing an error now follows this pattern:\r\n\r\nMetronError error = new MetronError()\r\n              .withErrorProperty(errorProperty) // error properties could include caught exception, raw message(s), error type, etc\r\n              ... // add as many properties as needed\r\nErrorUtils.handleError(collector, error);\r\n\r\nI expect there will be many opinions about the correct approach here.\r\n\r\nThe other abstraction involves retrieving a message from a tuple.  The primary driver for this is logging the original message that caused a failure.  The BulkWriterComponent class is passed both a tuple and a message which is then passed to the BulkMessageWriter.write method.  There are 2 challenges with this.  The first is that the returned BulkWriterResponse object only contains the tuples that failed and not the messages.  The other is that a message could have been transformed before being passed to the BulkWriterComponent so we need a way to get the original message again in case of a failure so that it may be replayed.  To solve this, I created a MessageGetStrategy interface that can be passed around between components to retrieve the original message if needed.  This could become a useful abstraction for other uses cases as well, for example making the BulkMessageWriterBolt configurable through flux.\r\n\r\nAll applicable unit and integration tests were updated (or created if they didn't already exist).  This can be tested in Quick Dev by editing the elasticsearch_error.properties to match the environment and starting the topology with the start_elasticsearch_error_topology.sh script.  The Bro sensor in that environment includes messages that fail to parse so error messages should be generated by default as long as that sensor is running.  These steps are manual because I'm assuming Ansible is being deprecated.  For a more automated approach, this can (and should) be tested with the Ambari MPack.  I am still trying to think of ways to simulate errors in other parts of the topology so if anyone has ideas let me know.\r\n\r\nI apologize for the size of this PR but error handling cuts across many different modules and classes and required a lot of updates so it was unavoidable.  I decided to not update the profiler topology yet because it does not include a bolt for handling errors like the other topologies.  This would require changes to the profiler topology architecture, adding to an already very large PR.  I am happy to take that on in a separate pull request or this one if everyone feels it should be included now.\r\n\r\nA special thanks to @justinleet for helping me with the Ambari MPack and @cestella for helping with the MessageGetStrategy abstraction (that he had already started with MessageGetters).  Looking forward to some feedback!

[METRON-701](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-701)\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nThe motivating example is that I would like to create an alert if the number of inbound flows to any host over a 15 minute interval is abnormal.\r\n\r\nIn its most basic form, to perform Threat Triage I need to know two things.\r\n1. What is the current value? \r\n2. What is an abnormal value?\r\n\r\nThe current problem with this is example is that the Threat Triage process is unable to answer the first question (What is the current value?). \r\n\r\nThe value being interrogated here, the number of inbound flows, is not a static value contained within any single telemetry message. This value is calculated across multiple messages by the Profiler. The current Threat Triage process cannot be used to interrogate values that do not exist in a single telemetry message.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nI am proposing that we treat the Profiler as a source of telemetry. The measurements captured by the Profiler would be enqueued into a Kafka topic. We would then treat those Profiler messages like any other telemetry. This would allow us to enrich, triage, and index those messages.\r\n\r\n* The Profiler topology was enhanced so that Profile measurements can be sent to HBase, Kafka, or both destinations.\r\n\r\n    * Sending the Profile data to Kafka helps answer the first question; What is the current value? Prior to this PR, there is no way for the Triage process to 'see' a summarized value.  \r\n\r\n    * The Profile data in HBase helps answer the second question; What is an abnormal value?  The triage rules would still use the Profiler Client and retrieve profile data from HBase to help define what an abnormal value is.  \r\n\r\n* Enhanced the Profile's `result` field to allow for a `profile` expression that defines a value that is written to the profile store for later retrieval.\r\n\r\n* Enhanced the Profile's `result` field to add one or more `triage` expressions that define values that are made available to the Threat Triage process.\r\n\r\n* This change is backwards compatible with the current profile definition syntax.  \r\nThe current profile result syntax, for example, `\"result\": \"2 + 2\"` is equivalent to `\"result\": { \"profile\": \"2 + 2\" }`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n* Alter the Profiler topology settings at `config/profiler.properties` to use a 1 minute period duration.  This is not necessary, but is  useful for the impatient.\r\n```\r\nprofiler.period.duration=1\r\nprofiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Start only the Bro, Enrichment, and Profiler topologies.  Stop other unnecessary services like Elasticsearch, Kibana, Monit, etc.\r\n```\r\nservice sensor-stubs start bro\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/start_parser_topology.sh -k node1:6667 -z node1:2181 -s bro\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/start_enrichment_topology.sh\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/start_profiler_topology.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Create a Profile that simply counts messages.  The value of the counter will be stored in the profile and will also be made available to Threat Triage.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"test\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n      \"onlyif\": \"source.type == 'bro'\",\r\n      \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n      \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n      \"result\": {\r\n          \"profile\": \"count\",\r\n          \"triage\": { \"count\": \"count\" }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Look for messages to hit the 'enrichments' topic in Kafka.\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 0.3.1]#  /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --topic enrichments | grep period\r\n{\"period.start\":1488233760000,\"period\":24803896,\"profile\":\"test\",\"count\":591,\"period.end\":1488233820000,\"is_alert\":\"true\",\"entity\":\"global\",\"timestamp\":1488233781638,\"source.type\":\"profiler\"}\r\n{\"period.start\":1488233820000,\"period\":24803897,\"profile\":\"test\",\"count\":161,\"period.end\":1488233880000,\"is_alert\":\"true\",\"entity\":\"global\",\"timestamp\":1488233841600,\"source.type\":\"profiler\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Ensure that the Profiler continues to write to HBase. (Be sure to set your Profiler Client period duration to match the Profiler itself).\r\n```\r\n$ bin/stellar -z node1:2181\r\nStellar, Go!\r\nPlease note that functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n{es.clustername=metron, es.ip=node1, es.port=9300, es.date.format=yyyy.MM.dd.HH, bootstrap.servers=node1:6667, profiler.client.period.duration=1, profiler.client.period.duration.units=MINUTES}\r\n[Stellar]>>>\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"test\", \"global\", 5, \"MINUTES\")\r\n[146, 147, 142, 120, 151]\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Add a threat triage rule that applies to the measurements coming out of the Profiler.  Run the following in a Stellar REPL.\r\n```\r\n# fetch the current config\r\nconf := CONFIG_GET(\"ENRICHMENT\", \"profiler\")\r\n\r\n# create a rule \r\nrule := profile == \"test\" and count > 100\r\ntriage := { \"name\":\"Test Rule\", \"rule\": SHELL_GET_EXPRESSION('rule'), \"score\":\"10\" }\r\nconf := THREAT_TRIAGE_ADD(conf, [triage])\r\n\r\n# save the configuration\r\nCONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", conf, \"profiler\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Ensure that the threat triage rule is being applied correctly.  Look for a key named `threat.triage.level` when `count > 100`.\r\n```\r\n$ /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --topic indexing | grep

these was an update of table formatting and fixing or improving links in documentation.  However some important content was changed, as outlined below.\r\n\r\n**Noteworthy changes**\r\n- Added a `brew cask install java` to fulfill a prerequisite of `brew install maven` for macOS install instructions.\r\n- Updated the “must be single quoted” table in `metron-platform/metron-common/README.md`.  Previously, `>` was in a nonexistent fourth column, so it was not being properly displayed via the README.md, and the last row seemed to be a repeat.\r\n  - Question:  Should we add the `in` operator to the “must be single quoted” table?\r\n\r\nPlease **do not merge** this until the dev list conversation titled “Ansible 2.0.0.2 build issues” comes to a resolution (being sent out soon).","created_at":"2017-02-09T16:59:06Z","updated_at":"2017-02-12T17:05:14Z","closed_at":"2017-02-10T19:45:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"582228fa7a4472ad442ddf93b546bca89cd7faa6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/447/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/447/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/447/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/6fec75c1477c131ef700da24e05ef468a6b9c1c8","head":{"label":"JonZeolla:METRON-708","ref":"METRON-708","sha":"6fec75c1477c131ef700da24e05ef468a6b9c1c8","user":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73077147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzA3NzE0Nw==","name":"metron","full_name":"JonZeolla/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JonZeolla","id":1385510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1385510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla","html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonZeolla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JonZeolla/metron","description":"Mirror

PR completes work in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-706\r\n\r\n(Note: there are commits from @cestella that I had merged in the process of working on this. They are squashed in master but show up here. They only show in the commit history, not the diff)\r\n\r\nMotivation for this PR is to expand where we expose Stellar capabilities. This work enables transformations and filtering on enrichment and threatintel extractors. The user is now able to specify transformation expressions on the column values and separately filter records based on a provided predicate. The same can also be done independently for the key indicator value used as part of the HBase key. In addition, a new property has been added to the configuration that allows a user to specify a Zookeeper quorum and reference global properties specified in the global config.\r\n\r\nSee the updated README for documentation details on the new properties.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nTesting follows closely with the methods defined in [#432](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/432#issuecomment-276733075)\r\n\r\n* Download the Alexa top 1m data set\r\n```\r\nwget http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip\r\nunzip top-1m.csv.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Stage import file\r\n```\r\nhead -n 10000 top-1m.csv > top-10k.csv\r\nhead -n 10 top-1m.csv > top-10.csv\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Create an extractor.json for the CSV data by editing extractor.json and pasting in these contents. (Set your zk_quorum to your own value if different from the default Vagrant quick-dev environment):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"config\" : {\r\n    \"zk_quorum\" : \"node1:2181\",\r\n    \"columns\" : {\r\n       \"rank\" : 0,\r\n       \"domain\" : 1\r\n    },\r\n    \"value_transform\" : {\r\n       \"domain\" : \"DOMAIN_REMOVE_TLD(domain)\",\r\n       \"port\" : \"es.port\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"value_filter\" : \"LENGTH(domain) > 0\",\r\n    \"indicator_column\" : \"domain\",\r\n    \"indicator_transform\" : {\r\n       \"indicator\" : \"DOMAIN_REMOVE_TLD(indicator)\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"indicator_filter\" : \"LENGTH(indicator) > 0\",\r\n    \"type\" : \"top_domains\",\r\n    \"separator\" : \",\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"extractor\" : \"CSV\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"port\" property/variable here is referencing \"es.port\" from the global config.\r\n\r\n* Run the import (parallelism of 5, batch size of 128)\r\n```\r\necho \"truncate 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell && /usr/metron/0.3.0/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i ./top-10k.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./extractor.json -p 5 -b 128 && echo \"count 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see 9275 records in HBase.

NOT INTEGRATE YET.  This is a preliminary review request.\r\nThis Jira Ticket is to add timeout flushing to all Writers that do batch writes.  Currently most of them will wait indefinitely for a batch to fill, resulting in message recycling due to `topology.message.timeout.secs`.  This changeset so far implements timeout flushing for the BulkMessageWriterBolt.\r\n\r\nI am now starting to work on unit tests, so while this code compiles and passes existing unit tests, the new functionality has not yet been tested.  However, I would be grateful for a quick review of the basic approach, focusing on changes in:\r\n* BulkMessageWriterBolt\r\n* BulkWriterComponent\r\n* BatchTimeoutHelper (new), and \r\n* IndexingConfigurations.  \r\n\r\nAll of the other changes are basically boilerplate, just laying \"getBatchTimeout()\" facade methods alongside existing \"getBatchSize()\" facade methods.  (There's a lot of layers!)\r\n\r\nThe flush-on-timeout logic is fairly straightforward.  It was implemented by a refactoring of BulkWriterComponent and basic Tick Tuple reception in BulkMessageWriterBolt.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part was figuring out the appropriate setting for 'topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs' if the administrator configures non-default batchTimeouts.  It is necessary to enumerate the batchTimeout settings for all configured sensorNames, which is implemented in IndexingConfigurations$getAllConfiguredTimeouts().  Then multiple other factors must be taken into account to determine the allowed and recommended settings, which is implemented in BatchTimeoutHelper.  If there are better ways to accomplish these things, please share your ideas.\r\n\r\nAfter feedback is incorporated, I need to make similar changes to the ParserWriter, and possibly other places in the code where batching is used and timeouts are not yet implemented.  That is separable work, which I'm aware also needs to be done.  Thanks for taking time to look at

[METRON-686](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-686)\r\n\r\nThe goal of threat triage is to prioritize the alerts that pose the greatest threat and thus need urgent attention.  To perform threat triage, a set of rules are applied to each message.  Each rule has a predicate to determine if the rule applies or not.  The threat score from each applied rule is aggregated into a single threat triage score that can be used to prioritize high risk threats.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n* All of the threat triage rules that were applied to a message during threat triage are captured and recorded.\r\n* A new 'reason' field was added to the threat triage rules to allow a rule author to provide contextual information to assist in actioning a threat. \r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nConsider the following triage rule set.\r\n```\r\n    \"triageConfig\" : {\r\n      \"riskLevelRules\" : [ {\r\n        \"name\" : \"Abnormal DNS Port\",\r\n        \"rule\" : \"source.type == 'bro' and protocol == 'dns' and ip_dst_port != 53\",\r\n        \"score\" : 10.0,\r\n        \"reason\" : \"FORMAT('Abnormal DNS Port: expected: 53, found: %s:%d', ip_dst_addr, ip_dst_port)\"\r\n      } ],\r\n      \"aggregator\" : \"MAX\",\r\n      \"aggregationConfig\" : { }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously the result of threat triage was a single threat score represented as a double.  \r\n```\r\n\"threat.triage.level\": 10.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of threat triage now provides greater information about the triage process.  This includes not only the overall score, but all of the rules that fired when triaging the message.\r\n```\r\n\"threat.triage.score\": 10.0,\r\n\"threat.triage.rules.0.score\": 10.0,\r\n\"threat.triage.rules.0.reason\": Abnormal DNS Port: expected: 53, found: 224.0.0.251:5353\",\r\n\"threat.triage.rules.0.name\": \"Abnormal DNS Port\",\r\n\"threat.triage.rules.0.comment\": null,\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nThe `ThreatTriageProcessor` attempts to apply each `RiskLevelRule` to a message being triaged.  If the rule's predicate returns true, the rule is applied to the message resulting in a `RuleScore`.  The `RuleScore` represents the portion of the threat score contributed by a single rule.  Each of the `RuleScore`s are aggregated into an overall `ThreatScore`, which captures the outcome of the threat triage process.  This `ThreatScore` is then attached to the message.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n(1) Setup a Metron environment with the default Bro sensor running.  The following commands can be executed in the Stellar REPL.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# fetch the current config\r\nconf := CONFIG_GET(\"ENRICHMENT\", \"bro\")\r\n\r\n# triage all bro telemetry\r\nis_alert := source.type == 'bro'\r\nconf := ENRICHMENT_STELLAR_TRANSFORM_ADD(conf, 'ENRICHMENT', SHELL_VARS2MAP('is_alert'))\r\n\r\n# create a rule that looks for DNS running on non-standard ports\r\nrule := source.type == \"bro\" and protocol == \"dns\" and ip_dst_port != 53\r\ntriage := { \"name\":\"Abnormal DNS Port\", \"rule\": SHELL_GET_EXPRESSION('rule'), \"reason\": SHELL_GET_EXPRESSION('reason'), \"score\":\"10\" }\r\nconf := THREAT_TRIAGE_ADD(conf, [triage])\r\n\r\n# save the configuration\r\nCONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", conf, \"bro\")\r\n\r\n# print the triage rules\r\nTHREAT_TRIAGE_PRINT(conf)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(2) Printing the threat triage rule in the REPL is going to look something like this.\r\n```\r\n╔═══════════════════╤═════════╤══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╤═══════╤═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗\r\n║ Name              │ Comment │ Triage Rule                                                      │ Score │ Reason                                                                            ║\r\n╠═══════════════════╪═════════╪══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╪═══════╪═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣\r\n║ Abnormal DNS Port │         │ source.type == \"bro\" and protocol == \"dns\" and ip_dst_port != 53 │ 10    │ FORMAT(\"Abnormal DNS Port: expected: 53, found: %s:%d\", ip_dst_addr, ip_dst_port) ║\r\n╚═══════════════════╧═════════╧══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╧═══════╧═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n(3) Monitor the messages being pushed to the 'indexing' topic in Kafka.  You should expect to see a message(s) where the additional `threat.triage.*` records have been appended.\r\n\r\n(4) Also, crack open Kibana, go to the \"Discover\" tab and search on the Bro indices.  You should also see all of the `threat.triage.*` fields in the Elasticsearch indices.","created_at":"2017-02-03T19:39:18Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T19:04:12Z","closed_at":"2017-02-27T23:03:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"538d772c513c5f8c2a9e457b4dc2dbb85b68dbef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/262ea51d3b59d6d5870fc01e1ce2b4a877a641f6","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-686","ref":"METRON-686","sha":"262ea51d3b59d6d5870fc01e1ce2b4a877a641f6","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

Update - I think this is ready for review.\r\n\r\nUpdate - Documentation pending, this is pretty much ready to go and could use some eyes on. The major change is that you'll need Docker (Docker for Mac on Macs) running for the build to complete. This is because the MPack requires the RPMs be built. \r\n\r\nTo test, run Quick Dev or Full Dev or both.\r\n\r\nI'll be working on the documentation in the next day or so.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first set of changes to enable Ansible installation to use the Ambari MPack. It currently works (in my environment) with full-dev using sensor-stubs. ~~It will not work with Quick-Dev or EC2 at this time~~. Update: All environments worked in my testing. \r\n\r\nIt's (well past - sorry) starting to get large, so I wanted to push it out for feedback while I'm working issues with the distributed install.\r\n\r\nSome points of interest:\r\n- As discussed, components (ES, Kibana, Metron Topologies) that are managed by Ambari are removed from Monit\r\n- I had added a notion of 'required configurations' to the blueprint and ambari_cluster_state script so blueprint verification would pass.\r\n- I've refactored our Ansible host groupings (see inventory/full-dev-platform/hosts). The Metron group is now the host that we use as the Metron services master.\r\n- I cleaned up the very minimum number of issues that @mattf-horton found in [METRON-609](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-609) required to make single-node deployment work with the MPack. It's my intention to work to get his changes incorporated on top of the final version of this changeset.\r\n- I removed the Solr role from Ansible. My current intention is to open a Jira to add a Solr Indexing component to the MPack.\r\n\r\nImmediate next steps:\r\n\r\n- [X] Get Full-Dev working.\r\n- [X] Get the EC2 distributed install working.\r\n- [X] Get Quick-Dev with enrichment replacement working.\r\n- [X] Adjust readmes and docs where required.\r\n- [X] Document test plan\r\n\r\nI also hope to receive and respond to

out country's geoname_id for city's geoname_id.  Both ids are the same in format (they're the ids for the geonames.org dataset).\r\n\r\nThe only direct effect I know of from this is the Kibana dashboard uses this field for unique locations (so changing what feeds this changes the dashboard output).  The main wrinkle is that city can be unpopulated, even though a country exists (e.g. if an IP is just assigned to the U.S., it may not have a city).  This isn't always true that (at least one IP range for Japan appears to fill in Japan as the city's geoname id).\r\n\r\nI'm opening the PR with just the direct change, but it's definitely open to discussion if we want to adjust.","created_at":"2017-02-02T12:49:42Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T12:16:26Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T16:09:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"213ee94d55c91dc62ae109e23703767fe75515ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/4d26af8a46a8f0dbd2c3b67319aaf96beda9d83c","head":{"label":"justinleet:METRON-680","ref":"METRON-680","sha":"4d26af8a46a8f0dbd2c3b67319aaf96beda9d83c","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62403147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQwMzE0Nw==","name":"metron","full_name":"justinleet/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet/metron","description":"Mirror

has come out rather well, I think.  The integration is still open to discussion.  Currently it is in a stand-alone, versioned-with-the-code sub-directory and sub-project.  The idea is that a release manager would build the site-book (following the instructions below), then copy it into a versioned subdirectory of the (unversioned) public site, to publish it along with each code release.\r\n\r\nTo build the book, do the following:\r\nIn any git clone of incubator-metron containing the site-book subdirectory,\r\n```\r\ncd site-book\r\nbin/generate-md.sh\r\nmvn site:site\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt only takes a few seconds.  You may now view your copy of the book in a browser by opening `file:///your/path/to/incubator-metron/site-book/target/site/index.html`.  On a Mac, you can just say `open target/site/index.html`\r\n\r\nEnjoy!  For code review purposes, the key files under site-book/ are:\r\n* **bin/generate-md.sh** copies all .md files from the code directory tree into the site tree, performs some transformations on them, and generates the nav tree structure and labels.\r\n* **bin/fix-md-dialect.awk** is called by 'generate-md.sh'.  It does transforms within the text of each file, related to converting the Github-MD dialect of markdown into the doxia-markdown dialect.\r\n* **pom.xml** and **src/site/site.xml** are doxia boilerplate, tweaked for our specific needs.  Thanks to @mmiklavc for his help getting these right.  Please don't squash the entire PR, as the second commit is to his credit.\r\n* The rest is either routine fixes to .md file syntax, or should be self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nNo .md files were harmed in the making of this PR!  The goal was \"If it works in Github-MD, don't edit the source .md file -- fix it in the re-writer.\"\r\n\r\nThe only thing hardwired is the handling of the few image files used; that can be removed when it becomes important.  Some may object to the awk script; if you wish to translate it into python, I'll be more than happy to accept the PR :-)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n--Matt","created_at":"2017-01-30T00:03:20Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T20:16:03Z","closed_at":"2017-02-06T20:16:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb101ed884a5e732b9b8ce421d51ef87ce6c06ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/429/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/429/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/429/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/7ac36e20f35969847bd77f16d5221ead78b9b1d6","head":{"label":"mattf-apache:METRON-660","ref":"METRON-660","sha":"7ac36e20f35969847bd77f16d5221ead78b9b1d6","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69620284,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTYyMDI4NA==","name":"metron","full_name":"mattf-apache/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache/metron","description":"Mirror

a Zeppelin Notebook that serves as a basic template for a situational awareness dashboard for the YAF flow telemetry produced by Metron. \r\n\r\nIn practice, this notebook should be enhanced and customized to leverage enrichments specific to your production environment.  The notebook provides a fair introduction into the mechanics of using Zeppelin/Spark to work with the telemetry that is archived by Metron in HDFS.  \r\n\r\nThe Zeppelin Notebook is deployed with Metron through the MPack and can be installed by using the \"Metron\" > \"Service Actions\" > \"Zeppelin Notebook Import\" action in Ambari.\r\n\r\n[METRON-676](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-676) contains a screen capture of the dashboard when it is run with roughly 7 days of archived telemetry data.\r\n\r\n### Dependency\r\n\r\nThis change is dependent on #423 , which is why you will see those commits included here.  Once #423 hits master, I will rebase on master.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this change by following these steps.\r\n\r\n#### Build It\r\n\r\n* Build Metron\r\n```\r\ncd incubator-metron\r\nmvn clean package -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n* Start Docker on your build machine\r\n* Build Metron RPMs\r\n```\r\ncd metron-deployment\r\nmvn clean package -Pbuild-rpms -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n* Build Ambari MPack\r\n```\r\ncd metron-deployment\r\nmvn clean package\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Setup Test VM\r\n* Launch Vagrant and install Ambari only\r\n```\r\ncd metron-deployment/vagrant/quick-dev-platform\r\nvagrant --ansible-tags=ambari up\r\n```\r\n* Copy artifacts to VM\r\n```\r\nscp metron-deployment/packaging/docker/rpm-docker/target/RPMS/noarch/*.rpm vagrant@node1:/tmp\r\nscp metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/target/metron_mpack-1.0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz vagrant@node1:/tmp\r\n```\r\n* Stage RPMS\r\n```\r\nvagrant ssh\r\nsudo su -\r\nmkdir /localrepo\r\ncp /tmp/metron*.rpm /localrepo\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Install Ambari MPack\r\n* Install MPack\r\n```\r\nambari-server install-mpack --mpack=/tmp/metron_mpack-1.0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz --verbose\r\n```\r\n* Restart Ambari\r\n```\r\nservice ambari-server restart\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Deploy Metron with MPack\r\n* You may need to clear the browser cache to see the additional options installed by the MPack.\r\n* Login to Ambari at http://node1:8080\r\n* Click \"Actions\" -> \"Add Services\", then choose \"Metron\"\r\n\r\n#### Install Zeppelin Notebooks\r\n* Login to Ambari at http://node1:8080.\r\n* In Ambari, click \"Metron\" > \"Service Actions\" > \"Zeppelin Notebook Import\"\r\n* Wait for the action to complete in Ambari.\r\n* Login to Zeppelin at http://node1:9995\r\n* Search for the notebook named \"Metron - YAF Telemetry\"  \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-26T21:29:38Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T19:04:11Z","closed_at":"2017-01-31T19:53:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91e4d1eed89be918f2205f315f73f122260b641c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/119d73161d99ed60f5301c25cd75900b4a59d4ac","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-676","ref":"METRON-676","sha":"119d73161d99ed60f5301c25cd75900b4a59d4ac","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

PR is not ready for prime time, but is provided for ease of access to work-in-progress for:\r\n- METRON-609 Enhance Mpack to handle single-node and small-cluster installs of Elasticsearch, and \r\n- METRON-634 Mpack bug fixes and improvements (not related to singlenode install).  \r\n\r\nThese are presented as two separate commits, so you can look at them separately if you wish.\r\n\r\nThese are the included enhancements from METRON-609:\r\n- Enable 1-, 2-, and 3-node clusters to have a working Elasticsearch install via the Mpack.\r\n\t- Change constraints from 1+ Masters and 3+ Slaves, to 1+ and 0+.\r\n\t- Allow non-dedicated master/datanodes via boolean \"masters_also_are_datanodes\".\r\n\t- Allow use of alternative single-node template via \"single_node_elasticsearch\" boolean.\r\n\t- Only the 1- and 4-node clusters have been tested, last month.\r\n- Improve various mouse-over Description fields in the GUI.\r\n- I included the attempted validation check on (storm) num_slots = slots_per_supervisor * num_supervisors.  This doesn't currently work due to pre-existing bug in other parts of validation check, so haven't been able to test.\r\n\r\nThese are the included enhancements and bug fixes from METRON-634:    \r\nNOT AFFECTING THE AMBARI DATABASE:\r\n- ES pid_dir specification and usage:\r\n\t- Currently pid_dir is multiply specified in elastic-env.xml and params.py. The config parameter should not be over-ridden in params.py.\r\n\t- PID_DIR failed to be included in /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch. It needs to be added to the template in elastic-sysconfig, as it must be provided to ES at launch-time (else the default directory will be used).\r\n\t- pid_file is specified in params.py, but is not used anywhere. (The ES internal launcher synthesizes it from PID_DIR, and this is appropriate.)\r\n- JAVA_HOME needs to be provided in /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch (templated in elastic-sysconfig.xml). Its absence causes Centos7 systemctl to fail the ES launch, unless /bin/java is defined (which it isn't necessarily).\r\n- Also in the /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch template in elastic-sysconfig.xml, the value of ES_JAVA_OPTS incorrectly spans 3 lines. The lines must be terminated with backslashes to effectively become a single line. The current inclusion of newlines in the long string value is acceptable (although unusual) in shellscript, but not in a systemd EnvironmentFile. /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch must function as both.\r\n- Also in ES_JAVA_OPTS, the two instances of log_dir needs to be followed by a slash '/'\r\n- In elastic.py, when directories are being pre-created and permissions set, the file $CONF_DIR/scripts should also be pre-created. I intermittently hit permissions issues with this directory being created later by root, and not properly assigned to elastic_user.\r\n- In several places in elastic.py, \"params.elastic_user\" is incorrectly used when \"params.user_group\" should be used.\r\n- Undefined \"format()\" method is used in elastic.py, unnecessarily in File(format(\"/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch\")...\r\n- Undefined \"format()\" method is similarly used several times unnecessarily in elastic_master.py\r\n- The comments and descriptions in elastic-site.xml have multiple suggested improvements.\r\n- Provide Quick Links in Ambari service page for Elasticsearch to the self-report pages for ES health and ES node list. (very useful for debugging)\r\n\r\nCHANGES THAT DO AFFECT THE AMBARI DATABASE:\r\n- pid_dir SHOULD be specified in elastic-sysconfig.xml, rather than elastic-env.xml, as it is a parameter that must be provided to ES at launch-time, but is not something there's any reason for the admin to change in usual circumstances.\r\n- conf_dir SHOULD be specified in elastic-env.xml or elastic-site.xml, not in elastic-sysconfig.xml. While it too is a parameter that must be provided to ES at launch-time, it is typically left to the installing admin where to put the config files.\r\n- The Ambari configuration parameter names in elastic-site.xml should be improved in several instances to make the semantics more obvious to the human reader (who may not be real familiar with Elasticsearch configuration). Mouse-over documentation will continue to provide the ES config parameter equivalents. In particular, suggest:\r\n\t- cluster_name -> es_cluster_name  (to distinguish ES cluster from Stack cluster)\r\n\t- zen_discovery_ping_unicast_hosts -> es_cluster_hosts\r\n\t- network_host -> network_bindings  (these are in fact interface names, not host names)\r\n- There are at least two places in elasticsearch.master.yaml.j2 (zen_discovery_ping_unicast_hosts and network_host) where needed square brackets are either missing or included in the configuration string. To be consistent with other usages, and less prone to human error, the square brackets should not be in the configuration string but rather should be provided in the template text.\r\n- In METRON/0.3.0/configuration/metron-env.xml and METRON/0.3.0/package/scripts/params/params_linux.py, the value \"metron_apps_indexed_hdfs_dir\" does not need to be settable by admin; it is appropriate to require it to be subordinate to \"metron_apps_hdfs_dir\". Thus it can be removed from metron-env.xml and set to \"{metron_apps_hdfs_dir}/indexing/indexed\" in params_linux.py.

failure is due to a change in default behavior when indexing was split off into a separate configuration file.  The default batch size was changed from `5` to `1` in particular.  This, by itself, is not a problem, but the `IndexingIntegrationTest` (base class for Solr and Elastic search integration tests):\r\n* submits the configs\r\n* starts the indexing topology\r\n* writes the input data\r\n\r\nThe writing of the input data may happen before the topology fully loads or the configuration fully loads, especially if the machine running the unit tests is under load (like with travis).  As a result, the first record may end up with the default batch size (of 1) and write out immediately because the indexing configs haven't loaded into zookeeper just yet.  In that circumstance, eventually the configs load and the batch size is set to `5`.  Meanwhile we've written 10 records and are expecting 10 in return, but because you wrote the first out already and then the next 5, we have another 4 pending to be written by the `BulkMessageWriterBolt`.\r\n\r\nSo, the failure scenario is as follows:\r\n* Message 1 is received and the indexing config hasn't loaded yet, so the batch size is 1 and it immediately gets written out\r\n* Message 2 - 5 are each received and the indexing config has loaded, so the batch size is 5 and it queues up\r\n* Message 6 is received and the batch writes out\r\n* Messages 7 - 10 are received, but never make a full batch, so we time out waiting for them to write out\r\n\r\nThe fix is to ensure that we don't write out messages to kafka until the configs are loaded, which is what this PR

Zeppelin to the Ambari Management Pack portion.  Adding to the Ansible / quick dev portion is happening a bit in parallel with Nick's work on METRON-346.\r\n\r\nThis ticket existed before the mpack, so if we're not comfortable having this just cover the mpack I'd prefer to split this ticket rather than force them together.  This isn't packaging up any notebooks, so there's not deviation in functionality until notebooks are added.\r\n\r\nEssentially, this ties into metron-indexing (because we rely on data generated there).  I'm open to adjusting this if anybody feels strongly about it, but I think it's currently the best place.  Zeppelin notebook JSON files are loaded from metron-platform/metron-indexing/src/main/config/zeppelin/.  These files can be placed into subdirs for organization if desired. (e.g. zeppelin/bro/bro.json) and must end with .json.\r\n\r\nA custom action is added to the mpack to import these notebooks.  This action is available regardless of whether or not Metron itself is running. Zeppelin configuration is autopopulated by the management pack.\r\n\r\nZeppelin allows for duplicate notebook names (they'll be given differing IDs). I didn't implement a way to track installed notebooks, but this is potentially a good future feature (to allow us to delete all installed notebooks, etc.).  Once the management pack installs the notebooks, they're treated as belonging to Zeppelin entirely and can be managed there.\r\n\r\nFor testing, I created a few notebooks (valid, invalid, misnamed and in subdirs), updated the spec files, recreated the RPMs, and ran this up on a pretty constrained local cluster. I was able to see them and run sections of them as appropriate.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-25T15:20:10Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T12:13:12Z","closed_at":"2017-01-27T14:03:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"793eceb6e40ddd0be4b6caff7ec7433de0d64164","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/423/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/423/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/423/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/f7fc8000453e48d6413139646ff8aab5417e23ad","head":{"label":"justinleet:zeppelin_dashboard","ref":"zeppelin_dashboard","sha":"f7fc8000453e48d6413139646ff8aab5417e23ad","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62403147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQwMzE0Nw==","name":"metron","full_name":"justinleet/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet/metron","description":"Mirror

a constrained environment, like 'Quick Dev', Monit will often incorrectly report the status of a Metron topology. This occurs when the environment is under load and a query of topology status exceeds the default timeout of 30 seconds. \r\n\r\nAdded a parameter so that the timeout for a status check can be extended under these conditions. This was previously done for starting and stopping a topology, but not for a status checks.\r\n\r\nThis was tested in 'Quick Dev' and made starting, stopping and reporting status of the topologies using Monit work much better.  Previously Monit would erroneously report some of the topologies as not running when they were.  This would also interfere with your ability to start/stop the same topologies.  \r\n\r\nFor example, starting all of the services required to consume Bro telemetry works much better with this change.\r\n```\r\nmonit -g bro start\r\n```","created_at":"2017-01-23T15:06:42Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T19:04:09Z","closed_at":"2017-03-17T14:43:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b7c810474ca0649cc93390fc773a4bbbefead02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/f3c4ef3a7bd2dec2c1a947e10a99d3cdd26d533c","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-670","ref":"METRON-670","sha":"f3c4ef3a7bd2dec2c1a947e10a99d3cdd26d533c","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

MySQL Removed\r\nDrops MySQL entirely from the project.  This is done for a couple reasons outlined in a discussion thread on the dev lists.  They boil down to a combination of licensing, eliminating a single point of failure, and using MaxMind's libraries for handling GeoLite2 data, and a couple other concerns.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes dependencies, installation paths, READMEs, etc.  The only places left are MySQLConfig and MySQLConfigTest for if anyone wants to use them.  The vast majority of removed files / code are simply from stripping this out.  If any traces of MySQL outside of this are found in review, they should almost certainly be removed.\r\n\r\nThis moves to a system based on using [MaxMind's binary DB](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) directly. Per their page:\r\n\r\n> The GeoLite2 databases are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. \r\n\r\nOur LICENSE file has been updated with the notification that we include use their database (and some of their [test data](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB), which is CCA ShareAlike 3.0).  Both of these licenses are acceptable for us as stated on [Apache Legal](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved#cc-sa).\r\n\r\nLet me know if that notification should be in a different spot or spots, and I can adjust it appropriately.\r\n\r\n## GeoLite2 Database\r\nThe main portion of the PR is in `GeoLiteDatabaseTest.java`, which manages access to the GeoLite2 database.\r\n\r\n### Raw Database\r\nThe raw database is stored on HDFS.  By default, it will be in `/apps/metron/geo`.  If no explicit location is given, `/apps/metron/geo/default/<db_filename>` will be used.  Otherwise, updates will use `/apps/metron/geo/<millis>/<db_filename>`.  Given the low rate of churn on the DB (updated once per week) and the potential for replay use cases , I haven't implemented any pruning or anything fancy on top of this.\r\n\r\n#### Updating DB\r\nA script is provided for updates `geo_enrichment_load.sh` in `metron-data-management`.  Usage details are provided in `metron-data-management/README.md`.  Note that the original didn't appear to have update capabilities, \r\n\r\nThe script will pull down a new instance of GeoLite2 database.  This location can be either their standard web address (or somewhere else hosted), or even a file:// URL.  Once the db file is pulled down, it will push to the appropriate HDFS location.  Finally, it will pull down and update the global config with the new location.  This will not require a topology restart.\r\n\r\nNote that there have been conversations about how we manage config updates (specifically leaning towards Ambari).  This has not been finalized, and we have two non Ambari testing environments (quickdev and docker-metron) so this just hits ZK.  Ambari is not updated based on this script, and it is the user's responsibility to update global.json.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a questions people may have preferences on\r\n\r\n- Do we want the script to always update? Should there be a flag to stage the file, but not update configs?\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nIt is a singleton that allows for the database to be updated when a global config is updated.  It is (hopefully!) correctly locked to avoid threading issues when updating or reading from the DB (and I've been able to update without issues.\r\n\r\nThe various Bolts have been updated to make sure they initialize the adapter to have it grab the current data appropriately.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a Stellar function has been provided GEO_GET(), which takes an IPV4 address.  It probably works with an IPV6 address, but I didn't really dig into it, given that the goal was to initially match parity.\r\n\r\nGiven the somewhat core nature of this, and my relative unfamiliarity going in with how all these pieces tie together, I'm definitely looking for feedback on how things are implemented, or if I missed conventions we've used in the code.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nUnit testing is added for the database and Stellar portions of the code as needed.  The DB testing uses one of MaxMind's test DB's that they've published, because we can't create the binary format correctly.  It does not use the full (20+ MB) version of the data, but rather a stripped down version (on the order of several KB).\r\n\r\nThree environments were tested during this.  Having these three disparate environments make features that cut across like this more complicated to test, so additional scrutiny would be merited (I would definitely like at least one person to run through one of these themselves and make sure it's transparent).  Notably, quickdev requires Ansible setup scripts to align; the mpack requires layout, internal configuration, and handling of additional files and ownership of scripts to work properly; and docker-metron requires essentially cheating the scripts and just running a wget on the file because things aren't actually setup.\r\n\r\n- quickdev\r\n- Ambari Management Pack\r\n- docker-metron\r\n\r\n### QuickDev\r\nAnsible scripts are updated.  Running data through topologies kicked out the data.\r\n\r\n### Ambari Management Pack\r\nRPMs updated where needed. Config Screen layout changed, updates made to properly handle configs and ownership.  Ran Stellar on this install.  Again, ran data through the topology.\r\n\r\n### Docker\r\nEssentially this just involved cheating the scripts and running a wget on the GeoLite2 dbfile, because there's no Hadoop.  Ran through the instructions to run the topologies (which are a little different than the others because Docker) and again was able to get data back out.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n- As noted above, do we want the DB script to always update? Should there be a flag to stage the file, but not update configs?  I primarily see this affecting the mpack because of the Ambari management behind it.\r\n- ~~Increased `withMaxTimeMS` in the indexing integration test.  This seems unrelated to my changes ( and I believe had been seen elsewhere), so if anybody has found the root cause, I can adjust my code appropriately.~~ Outside issue (and code is reverted in this PR), see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-672.  \r\n- LocID doesn't technically exist in the new data, and I suspect it was never meant to be relied upon anyway outside of being a join key.  The same applies to the new field that is replacing it in this context.  It seems like we were mostly just passing that field along because it was available, and it seems like it should be refactored to be more useful.  I didn't take on that analysis here, it's the slightly more validated version of a gut feeling.\r\n- The newer form of the MaxMind info has more data available than the old source we were using.  We should also consider passing (at least some) of this data along. See MaxMind's [What's New in GeoIp2](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/whats-new-in-geoip2/).  One of the ones that leapt out at me as potentially interesting was a field containing where an IP was registered, rather than just where the IP actually is.  Another is fields for `is_anonymous_proxy` key, etc.  I didn't validate if everything new is in the free version of the dataset.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-20T13:29:45Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T12:14:00Z","closed_at":"2017-01-26T16:22:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f1ac3f7a631dfbb033529fbf0e7996a67e92605","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/421/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/421/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/421/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/cda133d8dc6dc8062516a424b99760d89e835621","head":{"label":"justinleet:geo_mmdb","ref":"geo_mmdb","sha":"cda133d8dc6dc8062516a424b99760d89e835621","user":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62403147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjQwMzE0Nw==","name":"metron","full_name":"justinleet/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justinleet","id":5077341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5077341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet","html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinleet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justinleet/metron","description":"Mirror

service has been created to simulate the behavior of a sensor by sending canned telemetry data to a Kafka topic.  These \"Sensor Stubs\" consume fewer resources than the actual sensor that they replace.  \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI have tested this change by deploying and validating the following environments.  For each environment I manually validated it and ensured that data flowed end-to-end and was visible within the Metron dashboard.\r\n  * Quick Dev - Default with Sensor Stubs\r\n  * Quick Dev - Modified to install Sensors\r\n  * Full Dev - Default with Sensor Stubs\r\n  * Full Dev - Modified to install Sensors\r\n  * Amazon EC2 - Default with Sensors (behavior not changed)\r\n\r\n## Q&A\r\n \r\n### (Q) How do the sensor stubs work?\r\n\r\nThe stubs are installed with a set of canned data for each sensor type.  A subset of this canned data is randomly selected and sent to the Kafka topic in batches.  The timestamp of each message is updated to match current system time.  \r\n\r\n### (Q) How do I configure the message rate?\r\n\r\nThe number of telemetry messages sent in each batch, along with the time delay between batches is configurable.  Before installation, these values can be configured by redefining `sensor_stubs_delay` and `sensor_stubs_count`.  The values can also be configured by altering the deployed system service script at `/etc/init.d/sensor-stubs`.\r\n\r\n### (Q) How do I install the sensor stubs?\r\n\r\nUsing the default playbooks, this role can be installed by using the Ansible tag `sensor-stubs`.  This service is installed on the same hosts where the sensors would be; defined by the `sensors` host group.\r\n\r\nThe defaults for the \"Quick Dev\" and \"Full Dev\" environments have been changed so that  the Sensor Stubs are installed by default, rather than the sensors themselves.  The Amazon EC2 environment continues to install the original sensors by default.\r\n\r\n### (Q) How do I use the sensor stubs?\r\n\r\nStart all sensor stubs.  The output includes the PID for each running sensor stub.\r\n```\r\n$ service sensor-stubs start\r\nStarting sensor-stubs...\r\n       bro: Ok [26505]\r\n       yaf: Ok [26507]\r\n     snort: Ok [26509]\r\n```\r\n\r\nStop all sensor stubs.\r\n```\r\n$ service sensor-stubs stop\r\nStopping sensor-stubs...\r\n..       bro: Ok [26505]\r\n..       yaf: Ok [26507]\r\n..     snort: Ok [26509]\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart only the Bro sensor stub.\r\n```\r\n$ service sensor-stubs start bro\r\nStarting sensor-stubs...\r\n       bro: OK [11616]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### (Q) How do I install the original sensors?\r\n\r\nThe default behavior can be changed by skipping the `sensor-stubs` flag and including the `sensors` flag. For example, to deploy \"Quick Dev\" with the original sensors run the following command.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd metron-deployment/vagrant/quick-dev-platform\r\nvagrant --ansible-skip-tags=\"sensor-stubs,solr\"

the indexing configuration is bound and coupled with the sensor enrichment configuration.  This was done historically because indexing and enrichment were part of the same topology.  When the topologies were separated, the configurations were never separated, leaving a confusing section about indexes in the middle of the enrichment configuration.  This effort will separate out the configuration.  \r\n\r\nBecause of the configuration's simplicity, we are treating the config as just a `Map<String, Object>` and supporting the two existing configurations:\r\n* `batchSize`\r\n* `index`\r\n\r\nBecause this change is fairly deep, a few non-obvious things were also updated for consistency and necessity:\r\n* The Stellar Management functions `ENRICHMENT_SET_BATCH` and `ENRICHMENT_SET_INDEX` functions have been renamed to `INDEXING_SET_BATCH` and `INDEXING_SET_INDEX`\r\n* Support in `CONFIG_GET` and `CONFIG_PUT` for retrieving/storing indexing configurations was added.  \r\n* Support for indexing configurations were added to the zookeeper utility function\r\n* The indexing RPM was updated to include the new configs for the shipped sensors.\r\n\r\nI have *not* updated the management pack to create a new panel for managing indexing configs.  That will be part of a follow-on JIRA (METRON-653).\r\n\r\nI have done smoke testing on quickdev, but will include more comprehensive testing explanation in the comments.  I feel that this has the possibility of causing regressions, so I want to be explicit in testing methodology.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I plan on creating a wiki section about about migrations, because this will necessitate migrating configs when upgrading from 0.3.0 to the next version.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Please review, but do NOT commit this PR until METRON-653 is complete and reviewed.\r\nEDIT2: It does not seem to create a regression (by inspection) and METRON-653 is unnecessary","created_at":"2017-01-12T14:32:14Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T21:51:08Z","closed_at":"2017-01-16T21:51:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e461d3d383ff30fb89a4ef56a0da4a5dd8a1d70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/415/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/415/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/415/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/85321592c697258f9c0ca8da87aceaa0c4b274cb","head":{"label":"cestella:METRON-652","ref":"METRON-652","sha":"85321592c697258f9c0ca8da87aceaa0c4b274cb","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47701789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzcwMTc4OQ==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"cestella/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

PR builds on top of @nickwallen 's work in METRON-529, which has already been committed to master. It adds an optional argument to PROFILE_GET, allowing run-time overrides of the profiler client global configuration parameters. The primary use case is when historical profiles have been created with a different profile configuration than is currently configured, and the analyst needing to access them does not want to change the global client configuration so as not to disrupt the work of other analysts working with current profiles.\r\n\r\nThis PR is essentially similar to the former proposed PR-345, except that the signature of the PROFILE_GET function has been changed to make `groups` be a List instead of a \"varargs\"-style sequence, so the new `config_overrides` Map argument can come after it.  This avoids a really hacky over-indulgence in polymorphism, and is consistent with discussion in PR-395.  I'm opening a new PR, rather than reopening the old one, because I also had to rebase to changes in master, and the forced push destroyed the history that PR-345 pointed at.\r\n\r\nAt suggestion of @cestella , scope of this work item was expanded to include checking for config changes at run time, in the PROFILE_GET Stellar function.  This is a much needed enhancement.\r\n\r\nI also considerably improved the documentation of PROFILE_GET as regards the `groups` argument, with input from @nickwallen .  Thanks, Nick!\r\n\r\nTesting: This build has passed Travis in my fork, and should shortly be reported passed here.  Since the only code changes were to the Stellar function, the corresponding junit tests are actually sufficient testing.  However, I will go ahead and test them on a live single-host test platform, taking the opportunity to test the new Profiler RPMs from PR-413!  I'll report the results here tomorrow.","created_at":"2017-01-09T22:57:08Z","updated_at":"2017-01-16T14:18:55Z","closed_at":"2017-01-16T14:18:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd36bb5bcfed200737fb85a556ac7feaaf9bbf91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/414/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/414/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/414/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/ba8ac15f04ded4ce89e1952ecc93c0a54b6a6130","head":{"label":"mattf-apache:METRON-532","ref":"METRON-532","sha":"ba8ac15f04ded4ce89e1952ecc93c0a54b6a6130","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69620284,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTYyMDI4NA==","name":"metron","full_name":"mattf-apache/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache/metron","description":"Mirror

term fix for the build, along with some cleanup noted in METRON-648 (which was closed as a dupe of 647).\r\n\r\nTwo classes are adjusted:\r\n\r\n`BasicAsaParserTest:testIp6Addr`: The rawMessage string has been adjusted to include 2016 explicitly.  In addition `assertTrue` has been replaced with `assertEquals` and params put in correct order.\r\n\r\n`GrokWebSphereParserTest`: Tests no longer use explicit timestamps, but instead generate a timestamp based on the current year (UTC timezone is used, because GrokParser defaults to UTC if no timezone is explicitly provided). Using current year is not desirable long term behavior, but the tests now match existing behavior and the build can succeed. In addition the order of params to `assertEquals` is corrected and values are no longer unnecessarily coerced.\r\n\r\nA follow-on ticket will be created for handling dates in a more robust

Fastcapa Test Environment could not be started.  There were three problems that needed addressed.\r\n\r\n1. The version of DPDK being used (2.2.0) does not work with newer versions of the Linux kernel.  See [this thread](http://dpdk.org/ml/archives/dev/2016-June/040968.html) for more information. Updating to the latest DPDK release, 16.11 which is N+3 from 2.2.0, resolved this problem.\r\n\r\n2. The `install_pcap_replay` variable was not defined.  This variable is required and was added sometime after the creation of the Fastcapa test environment.\r\n\r\n3. In the Fastcapa Ansible deployment scripts, I moved all tasks into a separate `tasks` block.  Previously, Ansible was more forgiving and allowed tasks to be embedded in the `roles` block.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nThe Ansible deployment includes a complete validation process at the tail end of deployment.  If the process completes successfully, then you know that it is working.  Look for the message \"Successfully received a Kafka message from fastcapa!\"  The message, or absence thereof, is hard to miss.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd

using the rpm-docker image to build the project RPMs will only succeed using Docker for Mac due to the way it handles permissions. When using docker-machine/boot2docker, \"Bad owner/group\" build errors occur due to the SPEC and SOURCE files having an owner uid which does not map to an existing user within the container.\r\n\r\nSome background. When using Docker for Mac any volume mounted from the host into the container is munged into being owned by the running user within the container. Hence there are no permissions issues like we see with docker-machine/boot2docker.\r\n\r\nModified the build.sh script to ensure the owner uid of the metron.spec file maps to an existing user in the container and that the rpms post-build are owned by the same user.\r\n\r\nTested on Docker for Mac, docker-machine/boot2docker, and a local docker-engine on Linux. RPMs build as expected in each case.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-03T18:30:46Z","updated_at":"2017-01-13T01:43:42Z","closed_at":"2017-01-13T01:43:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a64251a0ad58b9c47c2a5208344f040fb5f68b9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/707ca1ce3dbfd4b495e8a0ccda514dbedde9be91","head":{"label":"kylerichardson:METRON-644","ref":"METRON-644","sha":"707ca1ce3dbfd4b495e8a0ccda514dbedde9be91","user":{"login":"kylerichardson","id":10392029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkyMDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10392029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson","html_url":"https://github.com/kylerichardson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63361378,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzM2MTM3OA==","name":"metron","full_name":"kylerichardson/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylerichardson","id":10392029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkyMDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10392029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson","html_url":"https://github.com/kylerichardson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylerichardson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylerichardson/metron","description":"Mirror

\"metron-mpack-singlenode\" is very similar to \"metron-mpack\", and can be usefully compared with it for code review, altho it also includes many bug fixes proposed in METRON-634.  As it says in the Jira, this is a short-term fix by providing a completely separate Mpack just for the single-node scenario, until we can work the bugs out of an mpack that works on all sizes of cluster.\r\n\r\nThis was tested on a Centos7 VM with 16GB of RAM, and all prerequisites installed, including Python 2.7.11.  The usual install process was followed, with Ambari 2.4.2 and HDP stack 2.5.3.  After successful startup, a few thousand 'bro' packets were injected, and were seen to correctly propagate through parser, enricher, and indexer topologies, and finally into elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nAn outstanding issue is that the configuration validator in the mpack doesn't work.  It fails with \"unknown error\" and must be ignored.  The multi-node mpack already had this problem, and I have run out of time to try to fix it here.  Consequently, my enhancement of trying to automatically flag the user if less than five Storm Supervisor Slots are allocated (commit 9ad8706), is untested.  I would like to open a new Jira for this issue, since it was pre-existing before these additions.\r\nThanks,\r\n--Matt","created_at":"2017-01-03T07:54:17Z","updated_at":"2017-05-15T16:19:30Z","closed_at":"2017-05-15T16:19:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8f31d77a624c89302cbd471df3a07a479210907","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/408/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/408/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/408/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/7710c775c00d985cd2dadee8b78eed3aefdefa50","head":{"label":"mattf-apache:METRON-608","ref":"METRON-608","sha":"7710c775c00d985cd2dadee8b78eed3aefdefa50","user":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69620284,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTYyMDI4NA==","name":"metron","full_name":"mattf-apache/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattf-apache","id":908957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattf-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattf-apache/metron","description":"Mirror

alternative would be to simply remove the `STATS_*` entries from the table in metron-common, and to add a pointer to the other locations where Stellar functions are documented.

General cleanup in Stellar.g4\r\n- Refactored the grammar to consistently use fragments instead of inlining things.\r\n\r\n2. Updated the way Stellar transformations were validated\r\n- Previously Stellar parsed/evaluated the transformation to validate it. In certain circumstances this would cause failures. For instances, all variables would be resolved to null which would cause an error to be thrown when evaluating transformations such as: '1 < foo', '1 < null'. Both of these statements are syntactically valid.\r\n- Now the validation just checks whether the Stellar transformation is syntactically valid. It will not send the transformation through the listener as it once did. It will not validate that variables are defined. It will not validate functions are defined.\r\n\r\n3. Updated comparison/equality expression evaluation\r\n- Number 2 was required in order to update the comparison/equality evaluation.\r\n- Now statements such as 1 == '1' will return false.\r\n- When comparing numerical values, the standard promotion rules apply (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.6.2).\r\n- When comparing non-numeric types, compareTo method is used.\r\n- When either side is null then '==' and '!=' are used. For all other comparison operators null value would throw

have very little unit test coverage around the Networking functions in Stellar at the edge level. When diving a bit deeper on real data, I found a number of bugs around:\r\n* Domains with TLDs that are not part of the proper set of TLDs\r\n* URIs with schemes that Java doesn't know about.\r\n* IN_SUBNET takes multiple CIDRs, but only evaluates the first one.\r\n* Generally calling validate on these methods can be unsafe because they do not handle null arguments correctly.\r\n\r\nThis just shores up the functions and provides more explicit and detailed unit testing.

passing parameters to models, it's often useful to pass the binned representation of a variable based on an empirical statistical distribution, rather than the actual variable.

PR addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-627\r\n\r\nLeverages the HLLP implementation from https://github.com/addthis/stream-lib/blob/master/src/main/java/com/clearspring/analytics/stream/cardinality/HyperLogLogPlus.java\r\n\r\n4 new Stellar functions have been added that allow a user to initialize a cardinality estimator, add items, merge estimators, and calculate cardinality estimates.\r\n\r\n### `HLLP_ADD`\r\n  * Description: Add value to the HyperLogLogPlus estimator set.\r\n  * Input:\r\n    * hyperLogLogPlus - the hllp estimator to add a value to\r\n    * value+ - value to add to the set. Takes a single item or a list.\r\n  * Returns: The HyperLogLogPlus set with a new value added\r\n\r\n### `HLLP_CARDINALITY`\r\n  * Description: Returns HyperLogLogPlus-estimated cardinality for this set.\r\n  * Input:\r\n    * hyperLogLogPlus - the hllp set\r\n  * Returns: Long value representing the cardinality for this set\r\n\r\n### `HLLP_INIT`\r\n  * Description: Initializes the HyperLogLogPlus estimator set. p must be a value between 4 and sp and sp must be less than 32 and greater than 4.\r\n  * Input:\r\n    * p - the precision value for the normal set\r\n    * sp - the precision value for the sparse set. If p is set, but sp is 0 or not specified, the sparse set will be disabled.\r\n  * Returns: A new HyperLogLogPlus set\r\n\r\n### `HLLP_MERGE`\r\n  * Description: Merge hllp sets together. The resulting estimator is initialized with p and sp precision values from the first provided hllp estimator set.\r\n  * Input:\r\n    * hllp - List of hllp estimators to merge. Takes a single hllp set or a list.\r\n  * Returns: A new merged HyperLogLogPlus estimator set\r\n\r\n**Note:** Added new library to metron-common pom and added 3 new items to dependencies_with_url.csv.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Stellar REPL\r\nSpun up the Stellar REPL in quick-dev. And verified that the function composition is working as expected and returning correct cardinality estimates for simple sparse set cases. For example:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> HLLP_CARDINALITY(HLLP_MERGE( HLLP_ADD(HLLP_ADD(HLLP_INIT(), \"runnings\"), \"cool\"), HLLP_ADD(HLLP_ADD(HLLP_INIT(), \"bobsled\"), \"team\")))\r\n4\r\n[Stellar]>>> HLLP_CARDINALITY(HLLP_ADD(null, [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]))\r\n5\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Profiler\r\n**Note:** In order to fully test this PR with the profiler, the fixes in 420 are required - https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/pull/420\r\n\r\nTesting in a single node cluster with Bro will not give you a reasonable distribution of data, so I've ginned up a script to create some. This script will replace the timestamp and destination ip address for a dns and http record template. The split of distinct IP's is set to 60%, 20%, 20%.\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/python\r\nimport random\r\nimport sys\r\nimport time\r\nimport datetime\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n  freq_s = float(sys.argv[1])\r\n  r1 = '{\"dns\": {\"ts\":%TIMESTAMP%,\"uid\":\"CXtY9x4GUiVhHwLLAa\",\"id.orig_h\":\"192.168.66.1\",\"id.orig_p\":5353,\"id.resp_h\":\"%DEST_ADDR%\",\"id.resp_p\":5353,\"proto\":\"udp\",\"trans_id\":0,\"query\":\"_googlecast._tcp.local\",\"qclass\":1,\"qclass_name\":\"C_INTERNET\",\"qtype\":12,\"qtype_name\":\"PTR\",\"AA\":false,\"TC\":false,\"RD\":false,\"RA\":false,\"Z\":0,\"rejected\":false}}'\r\n  r2 = '{\"http\": {\"ts\":%TIMESTAMP%,\"uid\":\"C9RfeyXjNU00nvE8i\",\"id.orig_h\":\"192.168.138.158\",\"id.orig_p\":49184,\"id.resp_h\":\"%DEST_ADDR%\",\"id.resp_p\":80,\"trans_depth\":1,\"method\":\"GET\",\"host\":\"va872g.g90e1h.b8.642b63u.j985a2.v33e.37.pa269cc.e8mfzdgrf7g0.groupprograms.in\",\"uri\":\"/?285a4d4e4e5a4d4d4649584c5d43064b4745\",\"user_agent\":\"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0)\",\"request_body_len\":0,\"response_body_len\":560,\"status_code\":200,\"status_msg\":\"OK\",\"tags\":[],\"resp_fuids\":[\"FvZ5o85OV1E3xiZH\"],\"resp_mime_types\":[\"text/html\"]}}'\r\n\r\n  while True:\r\n    # print str(random.gauss(mu, sigma))\r\n    num = random.randint(1,10)\r\n    dest = \"224.0.0.25\"\r\n    if (num <= 6):\r\n        dest = dest + str(1)\r\n    elif (num <= 8):\r\n        dest = dest + str(2)\r\n    else:\r\n        dest = dest + str(3)\r\n\r\n    ts = datetime.datetime.now()\r\n    if (random.randint(1,2) == 1):\r\n        record = r1\r\n    else:\r\n        record = r2\r\n    print record.replace(\"%DEST_ADDR%\", dest).replace(\"%TIMESTAMP%\", ts.strftime(\"%s.%f\"))\r\n    sys.stdout.flush()\r\n    time.sleep(freq_s)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n  main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun as follows to create a random record every 3 seconds:\r\n`python bro-data.py 3 | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic bro`\r\n\r\nSetup $METRON_HOME/config/profiler.properties\r\n```\r\nprofiler.period.duration=1\r\nprofiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso setup Adjust $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json to adjust the capture duration:\r\n```\r\n\"profiler.client.period.duration\" : \"1\",\r\n\"profiler.client.period.duration.units\" : \"MINUTES\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetup profiler.json with 3 profiles.

[METRON-590](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-590)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n#### Creating Profiles with Live Data\r\n\r\nThe most common Profiler use case is creating profiles on live, streaming data. In this case the processing time and event time will normally remain close, but could differ under abnormal conditions.  Event time processing has some significant advantages in this scenario. \r\n\r\n* Profiles are not skewed by high demand that might delay the Profiler's processing.\r\n* Allows the Profiler to take planned/unplanned outages and pick up where it left off\r\n* Produces more accurate behavioral profiles when there is a time difference between when a behavior occurs and when the telemetry produced to tell us about that behavior is received. For example, think of a sensor that collects data in batches or mini-batches where we get data on regular intervals; every 10 minutes, hourly, etc.\r\n\r\n#### Creating Profiles with Replayed Data\r\n\r\nThe other use case that this positions us for is creating profiles from replayed or reprocessed archival data. \r\n\r\n * For example, I am creating a model based on a new feature that the Profiler is generating for me. When I move that model into Production, I need a historical view of that feature, to train my model. I can replay archived telemetry through the Profiler generating that history of my new feature. This allows the model to be effective in Production on day 1.  \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this PR doesn't actually deliver all we need to handle replaying data. This just provides one critical component. I don't want to give anyone the impression that this PR allows us to replay data at this point in time.  [METRON-594](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-594) is tracking the greater effort of replaying telemetry data through the Profiler.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Added event time processing support to the Profiler.  Previously the Profiler only supported processing time aka wall clock time processing.  Event time processing is advantageous as it is not susceptible to skew caused by heavy processing load, allows the reprocessing/replay of archived telemetry data, and under certain circumstances can produce a more accurate profile of entity behavior.\r\n\r\n* By default, the Profiler will use event time processing.  The Flux topology definition file must be edited to switch the Profiler to wall clock or processing time.\r\n\r\n* The Profiler is now leveraging Storm's windowing functionality introduced in Storm 1.x.  This provides the core engine for event time processing.  This also provides a means for the use of different window types, like sliding windows, in the Profiler.  This is currently not exposed to users of the Profiler as the Flux topology definition file must be edited to use different window types.\r\n\r\n* Enhanced the Profiler integration tests which was enabled by the use of event time processing.  The integration tests now generate 24 hours of telemetry data at roughly 3 messages per minute, and then flush profile values every 15 minutes.  The entire stream of values generated by the Profiler is then validated for correctness.\r\n\r\n*  Created a `ConfigurationManager` that can be used to read the latest configuration changes in a remote data store like Zookeeper.  The default implementation, `ZkConfigurationManager` replicates the functionality that is embedded in the `ConfiguredBolt` base class.  The Profiler bolts can no longer subclass `ConfiguredBolt` as it subclasses Storm's `BaseRichBolt` which will not work for the Profiler bolts.\r\n\r\n* The usability of the Profiler was enhanced to better support active profiles that are subsequently edited by the user. Changes should be handled seamlessly by the Profiler.  This is especially helpful when a mistake is made when creating a profile, which then needs to be fixed and updated.  The Profiler was also made more resilient to failures specific to a single Profile or Tuple.  Individual failures should not impact other Profiles or Tuples.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTested on a multi-node AWS cluster and the Quick Dev environment. Created, edited, and deleted multiple profile definitions as the Profiler was running and responding to the changes.  \r\n\r\nHere are manual steps that can be followed to test this PR.  At a high-level, we setup a Metron environment and run it for a period of time to create an 'enrichments' topic containing test data.  We then wait a period of time so that the data becomes stale and the timestamps attached to that data have passed.  We then start the Profiler, but tell it to consume from the `START` of the topic so that it reads all of the stale data.  We then query the Profiler to ensure that it is using the 'old' event timestamp.\r\n\r\n* Setup the Environment\r\n    * Start with a clean Metron environment.  \r\n    * Stop all sensors and topologies.\r\n    * Start consuming data from one sensor, like Snort, by starting Pcap Replay, Snort, and the Snort parser topology.  \r\n    * Ensure that data is landing in the 'enrichments' topic.\r\n    * Allow the environment to accumulate data in the 'enrichments' topic for 15 minutes.\r\n    * Stop all topologies and wait for an additional 15 - 60 minutes.\r\n* Setup the Profiler\r\n    * Create the Profiler table in HBase.\r\n        * `create 'profiler', 'P'`\r\n    * Configure the Profiler topology by editing `config/profiler.properties`.\r\n        * `profiler.period.duration=1`  \r\n        * `profiler.input.topic=enrichments`\r\n        * `kafka.start=START`\r\n    * Configure the Profiler Client by adding the following to the global properties.\r\n       * `\"profiler.client.period.duration\": \"1\",`\r\n       * `\"profiler.client.period.duration.units\": \"MINUTES\"`\r\n    * Define a profile that simply counts messages.\r\n    ```\r\n       {\r\n         \"profiles\" : [\r\n            {\r\n              \"profile\": \"counter\",\r\n              \"foreach\": \"'counter'\",\r\n              \"update\": { \"s\" : \"STATS_ADD(s, 1)\" },\r\n              \"result\": \"s\"\r\n            }\r\n         ]\r\n       }\r\n    ```\r\n    * Start the Profiler topology.\r\n* Validate\r\n    * Query the Profiler for data with a current timestamp.  There should be none.\r\n    ```\r\n    PROFILE_GET_FROM('counter', 'counter', MILLIS(5, 'MINUTES'))\r\n    ```\r\n    * Query the Profiler for data from 15 - 60 minutes ago, depending on how long you waited.  Data should be returned.\r\n    ```\r\n    PROFILE_GET_FROM('counter', 'counter', MILLIS(5, 'MINUTES'), NOW() - MILLIS(60, 'MINUTES')\r\n

rely on the t-digest library version 3.1 and elasticsearch brings along 3.0. There is a small API incompatibility between the two versions (namely the static method `TDigest.createAvlTreeDigest()` is available in 3.1 but not 3.0).\r\n\r\nIf the classpath for the Stellar REPL chooses the 3.0 version of the library, then deserialization is broken.  Strictly speaking this is not a problem of the serialized form being incorrect (we use t-digest's custom serialization), but a problem in the custom kryo serialization code in the class. It relies on the default constructor being called and then the digest being deserialized using the code within the t-digest library. Because the default constructor initializes the digest via a call that does not exist in 3.0, it breaks. The serialization logic is safe to use in both versions, but the object can't be constructed in 3.0.  This fix directly instantiates the AvlTreeDigest, which exists in both versions.","created_at":"2016-12-05T14:57:37Z","updated_at":"2016-12-06T16:30:46Z","closed_at":"2016-12-06T16:30:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99c10eb3f57bfba3904c76b46a300c3238909cc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/d8dd2a0ba28a6c737ed976a247cf97af7108626c","head":{"label":"cestella:stats_serialization_bug","ref":"stats_serialization_bug","sha":"d8dd2a0ba28a6c737ed976a247cf97af7108626c","user":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47701789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzcwMTc4OQ==","name":"incubator-metron","full_name":"cestella/incubator-metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cestella","id":540359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella","html_url":"https://github.com/cestella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cestella/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron","description":"Mirror

Profiler is repetitively overwriting previously written values. Where I would expect to see a series of multiple values in Hbase, one written per flush, there is only a single value. This same value is being repetitively overwritten with new data.\r\n\r\nThe following changes are included in the PR.\r\n\r\n* Refactored the ProfileBuilderBolt so that the logic for building a profile no longer lives in the bolt itself, but in a separate ProfileBuilder.  The bolt simply maintains a cache of ProfileBuilder instances.  This has helped simplify testing of this scenario. \r\n\r\n* Ensured that ProfileMeasurement objects are not reused, which reduces the likelihood of another defect like this in the future.\r\n\r\n* Added a Clock interface that allows me to advance time in the unit tests.  This was necessary for testing this specific defect.  This will also help with METRON-590 in dealing with processing versus event time.\r\n\r\n* Added a specific unit test for this defect.\r\n\r\n* Added a unit test for the recent 'tickUpdate' addition to the Profiler.\r\n\r\nThe change was tested on a live AWS cluster along with the 'Quick Dev' environment.","created_at":"2016-12-03T01:21:15Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T19:03:59Z","closed_at":"2016-12-05T19:26:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a033c7e8da15118eafde94daee0fb64515643515","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/77d69e2c74ed4a59debba099cdd41a513bc8bf40","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-606","ref":"METRON-606","sha":"77d69e2c74ed4a59debba099cdd41a513bc8bf40","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror

[METRON-597](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-597)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n#### MockHTable Put Log\r\n\r\nThe MockHTable uses an ArrayList to store a log of Puts that have been submitted against the MockHTable. The MockHTable, along with the put log, is accessed from multiple threads during the integration tests, but it is not thread safe.  The Put log is used by multiple tests, but more so by the ProfilerIntegrationTest. This tests polls the list to block the thread until the expected number of Puts have been submitted. This is likely why this test is more impacted by this issue than others.\r\n\r\n#### MockHTable Scanner\r\n\r\nPreviously the test was using `MockHTable.getScanner` to validate the results.  This was changed to grep the same information from the Put log itself, instead of relying on the scanner implementation in MockHTable.\r\n\r\n#### Test Validation\r\n\r\nSome of the test validation was very opinionated about the number of times the Profiler itself had flushed.  As the integration test is being validated, the Profiler is running in the background and will continue to flush measurements.  \r\n\r\nThe validation was changed to not care how many times the Profiler has flushed measurements to HBase.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nPrior to these changes, the Travis CI build was reliably failing.  After making these changes, the Travis CI build has passed at least 6 times in a row.\r\n\r\nI have also run this repeatedly on my local machine and have not experienced any failures.\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-01T22:17:53Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T19:03:50Z","closed_at":"2016-12-05T16:38:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2569e82c33dbea9421c2fa9a11aef2b8a7ca686","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/7344c05a2fe4add2809bbb3ea94b6c4d3bd937f6","head":{"label":"nickwallen:METRON-597-2","ref":"METRON-597-2","sha":"7344c05a2fe4add2809bbb3ea94b6c4d3bd937f6","user":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51026795,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTAyNjc5NQ==","name":"metron","full_name":"nickwallen/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nickwallen","id":2475409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2475409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickwallen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nickwallen/metron","description":"Mirror
