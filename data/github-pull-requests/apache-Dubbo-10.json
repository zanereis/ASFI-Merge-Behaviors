[io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-bom](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java) from 2.16.4 to 2.17.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-bom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Zipkin Reporter 2.17.0</h2>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter v2.17.0 updates default versions of dependencies so that CVE scanners like <a href=\"https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/\">trivy</a> pass by default. Details below for the interested.</p>\n<p>For example, trivy is now clean.</p>\n<pre><code>$ trivy -q --skip-files &quot;**/src/it/*/pom.xml&quot; repo https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to do this, and based on user demand, we had to change some default practice in our senders (the transport plug-in for sending spans to a zipkin compatible endpoint). Here is a summary of each and how versions are handled.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/activemq-client\">activemq-client</a> - Note that the recently released 6.x version is not compatible with 5.x due to package import change from javax.jms to jakarta.jms. Raise an issue if you need a later client as it will require a copy of the entire module to resolve.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/amqp-client\">amqp-client</a>  (rabbitmq) - The 4.x version is no longer maintained, so we set a 5.x version and test the old one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/kafka\">kafka</a> - the kafka-clients driver has not had any known compatibility problems, so we've left it as-is.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/libthrift\">libthrift</a> (scribe) - libthrift (used for the deprecated scribe transport) has never released a 1.0 version, so occasionally causes revlocks. <a href=\"https://github.com/zhfeng\"><code>@​zhfeng</code></a> noticed this in apache camel, as updating past the 4 year old 0.13 was impossible to work around. Luckily versions after that seem compatible with each other.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/okhttp3\">okhttp3</a> - The 3.x version is no longer maintained, so we set a 4.x version and test the old one. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/evantorrie\"><code>@​evantorrie</code></a> for explaining why this is important and <a href=\"https://github.com/shakuzen\"><code>@​shakuzen</code></a> for helping in the discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While not end-user affecting, we have also <a href=\"https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-docs/blob/master/running-recipes/popular-recipe-guides/migrate-from-junit-4-to-junit-5.md\">migrated from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5</a>, thanks to OpenRewrite recipes from <a href=\"https://github.com/TeamModerne\"><code>@​TeamModerne</code></a>. Also, we use docker images to test all messaging transports. This ensures compatibility with upstream in transparent ways, and also removes classpath conflicts from java-based messaging transports such as ActiveMQ and Kafka.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> for copious support work on this release, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.5...2.17.0\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.5...2.17.0</a></p>\n<p>Note: To pass Trivy at the moment, we have to skip old versions used only for compatibility testing. There is a <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/228\">discussion</a> about making this default.</p>\n<h2>Zipkin Reporter 2.16.5</h2>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter v2.16.5 updates dependencies and moves the build to work on current LTS JDKs (11, 17 and 21). Runtime Java versions remain the same. For example, the minimum Java version of the core jar remains 1.6.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.4...2.16.5\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.4...2.16.5</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/RELEASE.md\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-bom's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>OpenZipkin Release Process</h1>\n<p>This repo uses semantic versions. Please keep this in mind when choosing version numbers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alert others you are releasing</strong></p>\n<p>There should be no commits made to master while the release is in progress (about 10 minutes). Before you start\na release, alert others on <a href=\"https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\">gitter</a> so that they don't accidentally merge\nanything. If they do, and the build fails because of that, you'll have to recreate the release tag described below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Push a git tag</strong></p>\n<p>The trigger format is <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, ex <code>git tag release-1.18.1 &amp;&amp; git push origin release-1.18.1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wait for CI</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release</code></a>,\nwhich creates commits, <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag, and increments the version (maven-release-plugin).</p>\n<p>The <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy</code></a>, which does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishes jars to <a href=\"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases\">https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy</code></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Later, the same jars synchronize to Maven Central</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://search.maven.org/\">https://search.maven.org/</a> index will take longer than direct links like <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin\">https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Credentials</h2>\n<p>The release process uses various credentials. If you notice something failing due to unauthorized,\nlook at the notes in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml] and check the <a href=\"https://github.com/organizations/openzipkin/settings/secrets/actions\">org secrets</a>.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting invalid credentials</h3>\n<p>If you receive a '401 unauthorized' failure from OSSRH, it is likely\n<code>SONATYPE_USER</code> or <code>SONATYPE_PASSWORD</code> entries are invalid, or possibly the\nuser associated with them does not have rights to upload.</p>\n<p>The least destructive test is to try to publish a snapshot manually. By passing\nthe values CI would use, you can kick off a snapshot from your laptop. This\nis a good way to validate that your unencrypted credentials are authorized.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a snapshot deploy with specified credentials.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ export GPG_TTY=$(tty) &amp;&amp; GPG_PASSPHRASE=whackamole SONATYPE_USER=adrianmole SONATYPE_PASSWORD=ed6f20bde9123bbb2312b221 build-bin/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\n</code></pre>\n<h2>First release of the year</h2>\n<p>The license plugin verifies license headers of files include a copyright notice indicating the years a file was affected.\nThis information is taken from git history. There's a once-a-year problem with files that include version numbers (pom.xml).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-14T12:05:31Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T12:57:57Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T12:57:57Z","merged_at":"2023-12-14T12:57:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf410d346208d1af22ce8a73b2d16a85725fc9fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/79040caaa681e6b3a49b3bc94462084f27b5c67b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1214-test","ref":"1214-test","sha":"79040caaa681e6b3a49b3bc94462084f27b5c67b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-14T11:32:15Z","updated_at":"2023-12-15T01:35:41Z","closed_at":"2023-12-15T01:35:41Z","merged_at":"2023-12-15T01:35:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d1bb26e79efc55ed78cf8bba1f486e5691fcd32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2c0e27580fccb38aa5bb41f1937a8c17feb9fbdd","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1214-npe","ref":"1214-npe","sha":"2c0e27580fccb38aa5bb41f1937a8c17feb9fbdd","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nCloses #13413 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Added GitHub Actions to check for code style violations.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

`grpc.version` from 1.59.1 to 1.60.0.\nUpdates `io.grpc:grpc-core` from 1.59.1 to 1.60.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.60.0</h2>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Stabilize <code>ForwardingServerBuilder</code>, <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code>, and <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code>. Note that <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code> is stabilized (no changes will be made to it), but immediately deprecated in favor of <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10586\">#10586</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Deprecate <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder.delegate()</code>. De facto this deprecates the class itself, since all classes extending <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code> implement the <code>delegate()</code> method. See javadoc for details (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10587\">#10587</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Changed recently-introduced <code>LoadBalancer.acceptResolvedAddresses()</code> to return <code>Status</code> instead of <code>boolean</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10636\">#10636</a>). This is part of continued work to align the LB API cross-language and API stabilization</li>\n<li>stub: Deprecate StreamObservers (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10654\">#10654</a>)</li>\n<li>alts: AltsChannelBuilder now extends <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10587\">#10587</a>)</li>\n<li>protobuf: Stabilize <code>ProtoUtils.metadataMarshaller()</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10628\">#10628</a>)</li>\n<li>protobuf-lite: ProtoLiteUtils experimental comment (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10627\">#10627</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: <code>ManagedChannel</code>s now check the address types provided by the nameResolver (for the given target) with the address types supported by the channel transport and generate an error in case of mismatch. That dramatically improves the error message when an issue occurs</li>\n<li>core: When a server stream is closed due to user's code (an uncaught exception in halfClosed, messagesAvailable, onReady callback of a ServerStream's listener), the <code>Status.UNKNOWN</code> returned to the client will have <code>Application error processing RPC</code> description. Previously the description was empty. This is helpful to differentiate between server errors originated in user application, gRPC library, or even those injected by a proxy. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10643\">#10643</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: Log ORCA UNIMPLEMENTED error to subchannel logger. This removes them from the normal application logs, reducing log spam</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Change the underlying implementations of RingHash, RoundRobin, WeightedRoundRobin and LeastRequest load balancers to utilize the pick first load balancer rather than directly manage subchannels. This should only be noticeable if it introduced a bug</li>\n<li>core: Avoid flushing headers when the server returns a single response (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9314\">#9314</a>). This is a performance optimization to reduce the number of packets for non-streaming responses</li>\n<li>util: Make grpc-core an implementation dependency. This will prevent the io.grpc.internal classes in grpc-core from being visible during compilation when depending on just grpc-util</li>\n<li>netty: Implement <code>Http2Headers.isEmpty()</code>. This fixes compatibility with Netty 4.1.101.Final.</li>\n<li>netty: Add <code>NettyServerBuilder.maxRstFramesPerWindow()</code>. This can be used to limit impact of Rapid Reset</li>\n<li>netty: Disable huffman coding in headers (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10563\">#10563</a>). Huffman coding provides modest compression for relatively high CPU usage, especially within a data center. Rely just on the HPACK static and dynamic tables for compression, for higher performance.

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-10T01:56:55Z","updated_at":"2023-12-10T04:03:39Z","closed_at":"2023-12-10T03:28:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f497ea166d7f653ac51ca14961366670380f5e0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0a188c3e5e6b30136974519b12e3c7d33345f66f","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:mzz-dubbo-3.3.0-beta.1","ref":"mzz-dubbo-3.3.0-beta.1","sha":"0a188c3e5e6b30136974519b12e3c7d33345f66f","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168960913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5NjA5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"manzhizhen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe propose of this change is to make tests run faster. `DubboBootstrap` is only used once in the test `org.apache.dubbo.generic.GenericServiceTest`. There are five tests in the test class `org.apache.dubbo.generic.GenericServiceTest`. However, only `testGenericCompatible` tries to modify with `DubboBootstrap` and other four tests are not dealing with `DubboBootstrap`. Repeatly calling `DubboBootstrap.reset();` may cause a big cost in time. On our local machine, the time can jump from 4.281 s to 1.429 s after applying the change.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nChange the `@BeforeEach` annotation to `@AfterEach` annotation to only call `DubboBootstrap.reset();` once.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nWe confirm that if make this change, the test run time can jump from `4.281 s` to `1.429 s`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-09T07:33:41Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T11:12:28Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T11:12:28Z","merged_at":"2023-12-14T11:12:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"570cd47d9a47f93efcee835a47e40bdffe7046a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f4ff788e265271d2527e9586d8b920f7eb33c4a3","head":{"label":"TestBoost:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"f4ff788e265271d2527e9586d8b920f7eb33c4a3","user":{"login":"TestBoost","id":153348110,"node_id":"U_kgDOCSPoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153348110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost","html_url":"https://github.com/TestBoost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":729424624,"node_id":"R_kgDOK3oi8A","name":"dubbo","full_name":"TestBoost/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TestBoost","id":153348110,"node_id":"U_kgDOCSPoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153348110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost","html_url":"https://github.com/TestBoost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TestBoost/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-07T15:05:51Z","updated_at":"2023-12-14T07:46:04Z","closed_at":"2023-12-13T08:18:47Z","merged_at":"2023-12-13T08:18:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f7446c81def3ca38970a3c92c4842ba870072da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13464/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13464/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13464/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8fc65ab33fa3085c9dc6082a4241e97321863d6f","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/fix_attribute","ref":"fix/fix_attribute","sha":"8fc65ab33fa3085c9dc6082a4241e97321863d6f","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-04T02:10:19Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T04:48:28Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T04:48:27Z","merged_at":"2023-12-04T04:48:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e1310bea880add83510855a4506595ca488245e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1f99f271db76b2f08e46f36cb02c5927677ff3a7","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1204-serializable","ref":"1204-serializable","sha":"1f99f271db76b2f08e46f36cb02c5927677ff3a7","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-01T06:03:05Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T01:34:47Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T01:34:47Z","merged_at":"2023-12-04T01:34:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"58fa12079578b7def49fe6c386c1bcce97f2123a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13449/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13449/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13449/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/719bb4cf5b86ba1777a3b18527144c29ed4cfbde","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:fix_service_metrics_in_rt_stat","ref":"fix_service_metrics_in_rt_stat","sha":"719bb4cf5b86ba1777a3b18527144c29ed4cfbde","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-30T07:11:21Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T02:25:04Z","closed_at":"2023-12-01T02:25:04Z","merged_at":"2023-12-01T02:25:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"d552cfca51a07765b080a84b8bddd044a694bc98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7aa1e4f8030f9c9ad4555d9aa2d2738df57e851f","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1130-tri","ref":"1130-tri","sha":"7aa1e4f8030f9c9ad4555d9aa2d2738df57e851f","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- When exclude fastjson2 or hessian2 on runtime, `ClassNotFound` exception will occurred when init\r\n- Should failed serialization when load extensions, due to prefer serialzation will depend on it.\r\n- Integration test cases: https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples/pull/1028\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-30T06:22:32Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T13:32:51Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T13:32:51Z","merged_at":"2023-12-04T13:32:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d879666b4fc6163f42fcec2838633bb9f99a482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13441/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13441/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13441/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2e6d8ca78b472a0a4027855d7a2316a35cebf6f8","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1130-serialize-optional","ref":"1130-serialize-optional","sha":"2e6d8ca78b472a0a4027855d7a2316a35cebf6f8","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-30T05:40:17Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T09:42:08Z","closed_at":"2023-11-30T09:42:02Z","merged_at":"2023-11-30T09:42:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4e0189ed6f13c6714ecc2ecbc73a7be8ea103ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13440/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13440/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13440/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5b0964db9f6f9fb6a4a6a4e9bbdf5d2d425ad8b0","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/triple_generated_source_spotless_check","ref":"fix/triple_generated_source_spotless_check","sha":"5b0964db9f6f9fb6a4a6a4e9bbdf5d2d425ad8b0","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nReformat codes and comments in AbstractConditionMatcher to improve readability.\r\nThe previous code used three ifs to separately indicate what should be done in three conditions. They all do the same thing:\r\n1. Check mismatch conditions and return `false` if any one of these conditions is met.\r\n2. Check match conditions and return `true` if any one of these conditions is met.\r\n3. Return `true` if there are only mismatch rules (which means the matcher is only used to exclude cases). Otherwise, return `false`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we can combine the three situations into unified logic, which makes it easier for other users to understand the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nReformat codes and comments in `org.apache.dubbo.rpc.cluster.router.condition.matcher.AbstractConditionMatcher#isMatch`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nCurrently in Dubbo, there is a mixed use of log components, and some modules lack log configuration, due to no log output. Therefore, uniformly use log4j2 can reduce the learning and cost, reduce logging component conflicts\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. Replace log4j and logback with log4j2, providing a simple Log4j2 configuration. Unfortunately log4j2 does not support native, so have to use logback, update future while log4j2 support native.\r\n\r\n2. Adjusted versions of some artifacts in pom.xml to unify them as much as possible to the BOM.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nci passed\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-21T15:28:47Z","updated_at":"2023-11-23T11:54:32Z","closed_at":"2023-11-22T01:58:59Z","merged_at":"2023-11-22T01:58:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"a53228d545524acb6a0fc6424213ea3f7d5e2ae0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b543f180ed058db47e1231ccd88dcb8076c0cf9b","head":{"label":"oxsean:feature-13378-uniformly-use-log4j2","ref":"feature-13378-uniformly-use-log4j2","sha":"b543f180ed058db47e1231ccd88dcb8076c0cf9b","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-21T02:34:06Z","updated_at":"2023-11-25T07:53:01Z","closed_at":"2023-11-25T07:53:00Z","merged_at":"2023-11-25T07:53:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"e63d275eb61db8eaac00f7474e6e76e19ac805d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/af121eee6692324293ca16738a780620ab762612","head":{"label":"conghuhu:fix-micrometer-tracing-version","ref":"fix-micrometer-tracing-version","sha":"af121eee6692324293ca16738a780620ab762612","user":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":544346536,"node_id":"R_kgDOIHIRqA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"conghuhu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-21T01:30:15Z","updated_at":"2023-11-21T07:19:24Z","closed_at":"2023-11-21T07:19:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d403eff4a2553f8ec2d76dc5d207cbc58c383404","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13396/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13396/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13396/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7b7bd902be19788b4b4883a4d53549182e7e7a85","head":{"label":"sunheyi6:relativePath","ref":"relativePath","sha":"7b7bd902be19788b4b4883a4d53549182e7e7a85","user":{"login":"sunheyi6","id":50973219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTczMjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50973219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6","html_url":"https://github.com/sunheyi6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunheyi6/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"6194b43a8714917bd05dc901c95f7b558b9a9142","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

href=\"https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/releases\">io.projectreactor:reactor-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v3.6.0</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Reactor-Core 3.6.0 is part of 2023.0.0 Release Train.</p>\n<p>This is the first GA release of 2023.0.0 🎉</p>\n<p>This note focuses on 3.6.0 proper, curating changes from across all milestones and also includes changes already released as part of 3.4.x line up to 3.4.34 as well as 3.5.x line up to 3.5.12.</p>\n<p>While there are plenty of improvements and bug fixes, it's worth to highlight the bigger themes first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>Schedulers.boundedElastic()</code> may return a specific implementation tailored for <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/\">Project Loom</a> and running on virtual threads if application runs in Java 21+ runtime and have set the <code>reactor.schedulers.defaultBoundedElasticOnVirtualThreads</code> system property to <code>true</code>. Please consult the <a href=\"https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/snapshot/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html#boundedElastic--\">javadocs</a> and <a href=\"https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/snapshot/reference/#schedulers\">the reference documentation</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>Support for <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/238\">Multi-Release Jar</a>. Since this release project has java version specific sources that are enabled if runs in specific Java runtime. This allows to avoid unnecessary reflection checks as well as embrace some new neat java features without changing the baseline for the whole code base.</li>\n<li>Hardening of the context-propagation. This release introduces better support for external <code>Publisher</code>s detection with their corresponding decoration if detected. This enables more stable context-propagation when it comes to external libraries integration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See dedicated pre-release <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2023/10/31/what-new-is-coming-in-reactor-core-3-6-0#virtual-threads-support\">blogpost</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<h3>:warning: Update
