In some use case, only one dimension is relevant because the clusters are provisioned based on that category.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2670 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen adding/removing instance from a cluster, it is possible that at a point of time, instance config is gone but the INSTANCE ZNode is still there. This would cause config map in helix controller cache to have instance mapped to null config.\r\nWe need to add NPR guard in pipeline to prevent transient pipeline failure.\r\n\r\nThe failure is not a blocking error causing further pipeline failure but we would like to avoid noise in log.\r\n\r\nThis change add null check before access instance config. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-18T06:37:28Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T20:06:02Z","closed_at":"2023-10-18T20:06:02Z","merged_at":"2023-10-18T20:06:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"38a4f477a3efb109e18cd0713b947cbe4139d7a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2669/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2669/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2669/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/30261e55ac2a3f0a839b2b866b61e84cd5bf8e0f","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:instanceconfig","ref":"instanceconfig","sha":"30261e55ac2a3f0a839b2b866b61e84cd5bf8e0f","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix Pipeline  failed in IntermediateStateCalc stage as user reduced  the NUM_PARTITION in IdealState which resulted in deletion of partition from partitionMap for the resource. \r\nIntermediateStateCalc always assumes that prefereneList for partition is either empty or populated but with possible recent changes with WAGED n - n+1. \r\n\r\nFixing the NPE and skipping the checks for size/null for preferenceList.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestIntermediateStateCalcStage::testPartitionMissing\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the

non-deterministic order, which means that this assertion is not correct, because it checks whether the collections contain the same elements in the same order. This leads to a flack test. To fix this problem, the assertion has been rewritten to check if the collections contain the same amount of elements as well as booth collections contain all values of the other collection.\r\n\r\nTests that cause problems:

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2640\r\n<!-- (#200 - Link your issue number here: You can write \"Fixes #XXX\". Please use the proper keyword so that the issue gets closed automatically.

JSON strings are equal, if they have the same content and structure. Not only the elements in the arrays can change, but also the elements in the same object can change location. This is not considered in the assertion and leads to a flaky test.\r\n\r\nThis problem was found by the NonDex Engine – to reproduce run\r\n```shell\r\nmvn -pl helix-rest

We can't have a case where where there are two instances in the cluster with the same logicalId unless there is exactly 1 with `SWAP_OUT` and 1 with `SWAP_IN` `INSTANCE_OPERATION`.\r\n- addInstance: We now check to ensure that there is not already an instance in the cluster with the same logicalId. We only allow adding an instance with the same logicalId if the existing instance has `SWAP_OUT` `INSTANCE_OPERATION` or the add instance is being added in the disable state.\r\n- canSwapComplete: Checks if the swap of two instances is ready to mark completed. It takes either the `SWAP_OUT` or `SWAP_IN` instance as an argument. It does the following checks:\r\n  1. Both instances must be alive.\r\n  2. Both instances must only have one session and not be carrying over from a previous session.\r\n  3. Both instances must have no pending messages.\r\n  4. Both instances cannot have partitions in the ERROR state\r\n  5. SwapIn instance must have correct state for all partitions that are currently assigned to the SwapOut instance.\r\n- completeSwapPossible: Checks to see if the swap is ready to complete using isSwapReadyToComplete. If ready, it will clear the SwapIn node's `INSTANCE_OPERATION` and disable the SwapOut node.\r\n\r\nAdd ability for up to 2 nodes with the same logicalId to be added to the cluster at the same time when a SWAP is happening.\r\nDuring all paritionAssignment for WAGED and DelayedAutoRebalancer, we select just one instance for each logicalId.\r\n\r\nCases:\r\n- If only one instance with logicalId, it passes through the filter\r\n- If two instances with logicalId, SWAP_OUT passes through the filter if the other node is SWAP_IN. If SWAP_IN node passes through the filter when the SWAP is marked complete by setting the InstanceOperation of the SWAP_IN node to null.\r\n\r\nWhen SWAP_OUT nodes are the instances which pass through the filter and there are corresponding SWAP_IN nodes which are live and enabled, we add them to the end of all preference lists which contain the SWAP_OUT node following computeIdealState. This ensures that they are in secondTopState for all StateModels that can only have a single replica in the topState. For stateModels that allow multiple replicas of the topState, the SWAP_IN node could host topState replicas before the SWAP is completed.\r\n\r\nOnce the swap is complete and SWAP_IN node has InstanceOperation set to null, SWAP_IN node becomes assignable and WAGED and DelayedAutoRebalancer + CRUSHED will computePartitionAssignment and generate IdealState with SWAP_IN instance in same index of the preferenceList as the SWAP_OUT instance used to be in. This means that not only will SWAP_IN node have all the same partitions that the SWAP_OUT node had, but also the same states.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] testAddingNodeWithSwapOutInstanceOperation\r\n- [x] testAddingNodeWithSwapOutNodeInstanceOperationUnset\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapWithNoSwapOutNode\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapSwapInNodeNoInstanceOperationEnabled\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapSwapInNodeWithAlreadySwappingPair\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapWrongFaultZone\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapWrongCapacity\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapNoTopologySetup\r\n- [x] testNodeSwap\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapSwapInNodeNoInstanceOperationDisabled\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapCancelSwapWhenReadyToComplete\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapAfterEMM\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapWithSwapOutInstanceDisabled\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapAddSwapInFirstEnabledBeforeSwapOutSet(\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapAddSwapInFirstEnableBeforeSwapOutSet\r\n- [x] testUnsetInstanceOperationOnSwapInWhenAlreadyUnsetOnSwapOut\r\n- [x] testNodeSwapAddSwapInFirst\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  helix git:(helix_node_swap_apis) ✗ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestInstanceOperation -pl=helix-core\r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.helix:metrics-common:bundle:1.3.2-SNAPSHOT\r\n[WARNING] 'build.pluginManagement.plugins.plugin.(groupId:artifactId)' must be unique but found duplicate declaration of plugin org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin @ org.apache.helix:helix:1.3.2-SNAPSHOT, /Users/zapinto/Documents/git2/zpinto/helix/pom.xml, line 678, column 17\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.helix:helix:pom:1.3.2-SNAPSHOT\r\n[WARNING] 'build.pluginManagement.plugins.plugin.(groupId:artifactId)' must be unique but found duplicate declaration of plugin org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin @ line 678, column 17\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they threaten the stability of your build.\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] For this reason, future Maven versions might no longer support building such malformed projects.\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --------------------< org.apache.helix:helix-core >---------------------\r\n[INFO] Building Apache Helix :: Core 1.3.2-SNAPSHOT\r\n[INFO]   from pom.xml\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------[ bundle ]-------------------------------\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-maven-version) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-java-version) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-output-timestamp-property) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:prepare-agent (default) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] argLine set to -javaagent:/Users/zapinto/.m2/repository/org/jacoco/org.jacoco.agent/0.8.6/org.jacoco.agent-0.8.6-runtime.jar=destfile=/Users/zapinto/Documents/git2/zpinto/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- remote-resources:1.7.0:process (process-resource-bundles) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Preparing remote bundle org.apache:apache-jar-resource-bundle:1.4\r\n[INFO] Copying 3 resources from 1 bundle.\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- resources:3.2.0:resources (default-resources) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources.\r\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered properties files.\r\n[INFO] Copying 4 resources\r\n[INFO] Copying 0 resource\r\n[INFO] Copying 3 resources\r\n[INFO] The encoding used to copy filtered properties files have not been set.

_deserializedPartitionCapacityMap to ResourceConfig model to ensure that the partition capacity map is only deserialized one time. This will lead to major performance gains as this was previously called in several parts of BestPossibleStateCalculation and CurrentStateComputation.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n* [x]  My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n   [Optimize WagedInstanceCapacity Calculation to improve Helix Controller Pipeline #2646](https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2646)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDuring profiling we realized that the majority(up to 90%) of the CurrentStateComputationStage is taken up by `_objectMapper.readValue`.\r\n\r\nAfter investigating further, this problem is not only seen in CurrentStateComputationStage. By only deserializing on the first call to `getPartitionCapacityMap` we can **tremendously** improve the pipeline performance in more than one place.\r\n\r\nWhere is this called:\r\n- CurrentStateComputationStage\r\n  -  For every resource when reporting resource capacity metrics\r\n  -  For every  partition of WAGED resource when checkAndReduceInstanceCapacity based of currentStateMap\r\n  -  Every pending STATE_TRANSITION message for WAGED replica to checkAndReduceInstanceCapacity (n + 1 respect capacity solution)\r\n- BestPossibleStateCalcStage \r\n  -  For checkAndReduceCapacity of every instanceToAdd for all partitions of WAGED resources (n + 1 respect capacity solution)\r\n  - Called for the creation of every single AssignableReplica for all replicas of WAGED resources\r\n\r\nBasically, every time(unbounded as cluster grows) getPartitionCapacityWeightMap is called it is deserializing the PARTITION_CAPACITY_MAP mapField in the ResourceConfig over and over again. This change makes sure that deserialize only happens once per resource and will save lots of time.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nNo behavior changes, so will rely on current tests and CI to validate.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

changes:\r\n\r\npartitionAssignment API fails for clusters where resource configs aren't set due to NPE. This NPE occurs because getResourceConfig() will return null if the resource config does not exist, which is then added into the wagedResourceConfigs list. The below code is where the NPE occurs as one of the items in the list is null.\r\n\r\n```\r\n      dataProvider.setResourceConfigMap(resourceConfigs.stream()\r\n          .collect(Collectors.toMap(ResourceConfig::getResourceName, Function.identity())));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nNo new unit tests. But I did test this by deploying helix-rest locally to confirm that the partitionAssignment API worked after the change\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n$mvn test -o -Dtest=TestResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor -pl=helix-rest\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO]

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2651 \r\n\r\nResource view for instance does not get formatted correctly when you load it directly via the URL. \r\nhttps://<helix_ui_url>/<namespace>/<cluster>/instances/<instance_name>/resources\r\n\r\nWhen you access the instance resources page directly via the url or by refreshing the page, the datatable's row widths do not seem to get properly configured and are instead set to 50px. Seems like the UI relies on the loaded content to determine the width of the \"datatable-row-detail,\" and some interaction is causing the width to be determined prior to the content being populated..\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nForce the datatable rows to use 100% of the parent width\r\n\r\n<img width=\"729\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 6 26 55 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/helix/assets/80296166/6d430aee-b76c-4e41-bec4-6a039106c113\">\r\n\r\nThe only negative of this change would be that if the page is stretched over a very long screen, the row would still use the entire width allocated to it and would be stretched as a result - the space between the \"Partition\" and \"CurrentState\" columns/values would increase.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nDeployed helix front locally:\r\n`yarn build`\r\n`yarn start`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nN/A.. No java code changes, only to the styling sheet (.scss)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-11T02:29:11Z","updated_at":"2024-02-22T23:50:34Z","closed_at":"2024-02-22T23:50:34Z","merged_at":"2024-02-22T23:50:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a4da73a7449be44810f3f5342bcb093b2bc86d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/b8adf2d0d094c4d1d2852db1e3b33cd6c6867f79","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:fix-ui-row-width","ref":"fix-ui-row-width","sha":"b8adf2d0d094c4d1d2852db1e3b33cd6c6867f79","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2646 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWagedInstanceCapacity data-structure is computed every time during a pipeline run and in case of large clusters, this computation takes ~80% of total time and hence, it's important to improve its performance.\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we are performing following changes:\r\n* Created `WagedInstanceCapacityManager` class to cleanly factor-out the operations on WagedInstanceCapacity cache. It contains the condition on when the full build of cache should or shouldn't happen. With this we are skipping the full cache building in case of `TaskCurrentStateChange`, `MessageChange`, and `Resume` events.\r\n* In WagedInstanceCapacity, we are creating merged ResourceConfig once to determine the partition weights for all the partitions and not every time for each partition.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] `TestWagedInstanceCapacityManager`\r\n* testProcessEventWithNoWagedResources\r\n* testProcessEventWithSomeWagedResources\r\n* testProcessEventWithAllWagedResources\r\n* testShouldNoOp\r\n\r\n- [x] `TestWagedInstanceCapacity`\r\n* testProcessCurrentState\r\n* testProcessCurrentStateWithDoubleCharge\r\n* testProcessCurrentStateWithUnableToAssignPart\r\n\r\n- [x] `TestPipelinePerformance`\r\n* testWagedInstanceCapacityCalculationPerformance\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip.exec=true && mvn test -o -Dtest=TestWagedInstanceCapacity,TestWagedInstanceCapacityManager -pl=helix-core\r\n\r\n1425 [main] ERROR org.apache.helix.model.IdealState [] - could NOT determine replicas. set to 0\r\n1438 [main] ERROR org.apache.helix.model.IdealState [] - could NOT determine replicas. set to 0\r\n1447 [main] ERROR org.apache.helix.model.IdealState [] - could NOT determine replicas. set to 0\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.21 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 949 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  5.627 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2023-10-09T15:00:30-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-09T22:01:12Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T15:06:45Z","closed_at":"2023-10-23T18:09:14Z","merged_at":"2023-10-23T18:09:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd1d28c52126c27bbc3a3c156a18bee13f8079c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2649/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2649/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2649/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/04b2f1e50eb5f6f370bc19caab3305b68377f203","head":{"label":"himanshukandwal:hkandwal/optimize-calculation-of-resource-partition-weights","ref":"hkandwal/optimize-calculation-of-resource-partition-weights","sha":"04b2f1e50eb5f6f370bc19caab3305b68377f203","user":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676756685,"node_id":"R_kgDOKFZ8zQ","name":"helix","full_name":"himanshukandwal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal/helix","description":"Mirror

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhere the Hard Constraint fails, the error message is very generic and it doesn't give much information on which capacity dimension failed and with what values. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, we instead of returning a boolean result, we are returning ValidationResult class object that contains whether the validation has passed or not, and if not it will also contain an additional error-message.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nImproved Following Tests classes:\r\n* TestConstraintBasedAlgorithm\r\n* TestFaultZoneAwareConstraint\r\n* TestNodeCapacityConstraint\r\n* TestNodeMaxPartitionLimitConstraint\r\n* TestPartitionActivateConstraint\r\n* TestReplicaActivateConstraint\r\n*

compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nA potential memory leak may arise when the user calls `getHelixPropertyStore()`. This is because upon calling `HelixManager.disconnect()`, `_helixPropertyStore` is just set to null while a `stop()` method is needed to clean up the memory. Double checked other class variables. And it seems like `_helixPropertyStore` is the only class variable that isn't properly cleaned up after manager disconnects.\r\n\r\n(#200 - Link your issue number here: You can write \"Fixes #XXX\".

support to persist all instance information collected by CloudInstanceInformationProcessor in CloudInstanceInformation object. Add ability for CloudInstanceInformationProcessor to produce full DOMAIN field instead of appending _instanceName unless last character in CloudInstanceInformation.CloudInstanceField.FAULT_DOMAIN is '='.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTypically the information collected by the CloudInstanceInformationProcessor is used for constructing the DOMAIN field in InstanceConfig. There are some usecases where a customer wants to override the DOMAIN field from what was originally generated from auto-registration. When this happens, all the collected topology information is lost. In order to prevent losing this data, we will persist it in a new field called INSTANCE_INFO_MAP.\r\n\r\nPossible usecase steps:\r\n1. node comes online for first time using auto-reg and defaultInstanceConfig that has HELIX_ENABLED = false\r\n2. All topology information is collected with CloudInstanceInformationProcessor and returned as CloudInstanceInformation\r\n3. All information in CloudInstanceInformation is persisted into INSTANCE_INFO_MAP\r\n4. DOMAIN is generated from CloudInstanceInformation.CloudInstanceField.FAULT_DOMAIN field\r\n5. node has joined the cluster in disabled state\r\n6. customers external hook can now run to override the DOMAIN field with whatever they want and set HELIX_ENABLED = true\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] TestInstanceConfig updated to test new INSTANCE_INFO_MAP field\r\n- [x] TestParticipantAutoJoin updated to verify that INSTANCE_INFO_MAP is populated and DOMAIN is constructed without appending _instanceName in case that CloudInstanceInformationProcessor constructs the full domain(signified when there is not = at the end of CloudInstanceInformation.CloudInstanceField.FAULT_DOMAIN)\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  helix git:(support_persist_instance_info) mvn test -o -Dtest=TestInstanceConfig -pl=helix-core \r\n...\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]  T E S T S\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.helix.model.TestInstanceConfig\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.012 s - in org.apache.helix.model.TestInstanceConfig\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/zapinto/Documents/git/zpinto/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 947 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  9.512 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2023-09-19T18:05:33-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n➜  helix git:(support_persist_instance_info) mvn test -o -Dtest=TestInstanceAutoJoin -pl=helix-core\r\n...\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]  T E S T S\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestInstanceAutoJoin\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 34.07 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.paticipant.TestInstanceAutoJoin\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/zapinto/Documents/git/zpinto/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 947 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  43.920 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2023-09-19T18:04:52-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2616\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn order to improve the code readability and maintenance, we have created following additional classes:\r\n* TestExecutionRuntime - contains the Cluster Runtime information.\r\n* TestClusterParameters - Parameters used to build the test ZK cluster.\r\n* TestExecutionFlow - Dynamics test flow writer, helps in abstracting the repeated test functions.\r\n* TestClusterOperations - Contains static functions to manipulate on the test cluster.\r\n* TestClusterValidateOperations - Contains static functions to run validations on the test cluster.\r\n\r\nWith this as just a beginging, there is a lot we can do here to find such as:\r\n- Find more of such patterns and enriching TestExecutionFlow to allow standardized & simpler test case writing.\r\n- With proper abstraction and encapsulation, we can create a pool of TestZKClusters and parallelize the test case executions (as right now we just create one ZK Server and all tests are run against it)\r\n\r\nWe have simplified `ZKTestBase` class and a simple test has been updated with using the TestExecutionFlow: ```org.apache.helix.integration.TestStandAloneCMSessionExpiry#testStandAloneCMSessionExpiry```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1614\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-16 at 1 36 48 PM\"

TestStandAloneCMSessionExpiry#testStandAloneCMSessionExpiry\r\n* TestSchemataSM#testSchemataSM\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-16T20:49:44Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T22:52:13Z","closed_at":"2023-11-03T22:52:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f345f497fe348560d7534724bf9239dedd48d99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2617/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2617/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2617/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/bd25eea28e2a4ac7d2c865b84ad14901a5b8c966","head":{"label":"himanshukandwal:hkandwal/test-code-restructured","ref":"hkandwal/test-code-restructured","sha":"bd25eea28e2a4ac7d2c865b84ad14901a5b8c966","user":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676756685,"node_id":"R_kgDOKFZ8zQ","name":"helix","full_name":"himanshukandwal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal/helix","description":"Mirror

TopStateHandoffReportStage to be an Async Stage as it is the slowest stage in the pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn some cases TopStateHandoffReportStage is taking up to 1/3 of the total pipeline execution time. In order to speed up the pipeline execution time, we can make TopStateHandoffReportStage async since it is simply computing metrics and reporting without adding to ClusterEvent. No following stages depend on it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated BaseStageTest to handle Async stages so it can be used in TestTopStateHandoffMetrics\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  helix git:(top_state_report_async) ✗ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestTopStateHandoffMetrics -pl=helix-core\r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --------------------< org.apache.helix:helix-core >---------------------\r\n[INFO] Building Apache Helix :: Core 1.3.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n[INFO]   from pom.xml\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------[ bundle ]-------------------------------\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-maven-version) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-java-version) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-output-timestamp-property) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:prepare-agent (default) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] argLine set to -javaagent:/Users/zapinto/.m2/repository/org/jacoco/org.jacoco.agent/0.8.6/org.jacoco.agent-0.8.6-runtime.jar=destfile=/Users/zapinto/Documents/git/zpinto/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- remote-resources:1.7.0:process (process-resource-bundles) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Preparing remote bundle org.apache:apache-jar-resource-bundle:1.4\r\n[INFO] Copying 3 resources from 1 bundle.\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- resources:3.2.0:resources (default-resources) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources.\r\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered properties files.\r\n[INFO] Copying 4 resources\r\n[INFO] Copying 0 resource\r\n[INFO] Copying 3 resources\r\n[INFO] The encoding used to copy filtered properties files have not been set.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

support for setting a default InstanceConfig through HelixManagerProperty. This will allow InstanceConfig fields be able to have defaults while also allowing users to leverage autoJoin and autoRegistration.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPreviously, you would only be able to use HelixUtil.composeInstanceConfig when leveraging auto-join and auto-registration. With this change, the user can provide a configured default InstanceConfig to be used when composeInstanceConfig is used by auto-join and auto-registration. One use case is allowing the node to auto-join the cluster in `HELIX_ENABLED=false`\r\n\r\nThe default InstanceConfig is configurable in HelixManagerProperty which is the configuration object passed in at the entrypoint when the ZkHelixManager is instantiated.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] testAutoJoinWithDefaultInstanceConfig\r\n- [x] testInstanceConfigBuilder\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  helix git:(default_instance_configs) ✗ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestInstanceAutoJoin -pl=helix-core\r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.helix:metrics-common:bundle:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n[WARNING] 'build.pluginManagement.plugins.plugin.(groupId:artifactId)' must be unique but found duplicate declaration of plugin org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin @ org.apache.helix:helix:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT, /Users/zapinto/Documents/git/zpinto/helix/pom.xml, line 678, column 17\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.helix:helix:pom:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n[WARNING] 'build.pluginManagement.plugins.plugin.(groupId:artifactId)' must be unique but found duplicate declaration of plugin org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin @ line 678, column 17\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they threaten the stability of your build.\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] For this reason, future Maven versions might no longer support building such malformed projects.\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --------------------< org.apache.helix:helix-core >---------------------\r\n[INFO] Building Apache Helix :: Core 1.3.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n[INFO]   from pom.xml\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------[ bundle ]-------------------------------\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-maven-version) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-java-version) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-output-timestamp-property) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:prepare-agent (default) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] argLine set to -javaagent:/Users/zapinto/.m2/repository/org/jacoco/org.jacoco.agent/0.8.6/org.jacoco.agent-0.8.6-runtime.jar=destfile=/Users/zapinto/Documents/git/zpinto/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- remote-resources:1.7.0:process (process-resource-bundles) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Preparing remote bundle org.apache:apache-jar-resource-bundle:1.4\r\n[INFO] Copying 3 resources from 1 bundle.\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- resources:3.2.0:resources (default-resources) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources.\r\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered properties files.\r\n[INFO] Copying 4 resources\r\n[INFO] Copying 0 resource\r\n[INFO] Copying 3 resources\r\n[INFO] The encoding used to copy filtered properties files have not been set.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nMetaclient currently does not offer the functionality of attempting to create a key's parents if they do not exist.\r\nI'd like to expose a method that does the following:\r\nAssume no nodes have been created\r\ncreateFullPath(\"/a/b/c/d\", data)\r\nThis would then create nodes /a, /b, and /c with null values and lastly create node /d with the data passed in.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd functionality to create the full path to a key if the path does not already exist. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to both TestStressZkClient.Java and TestZkMetaClient.java\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nNone. Only new method\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNo documentation added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-23T19:45:33Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T20:26:44Z","closed_at":"2023-10-04T20:26:44Z","merged_at":"2023-10-04T20:26:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"113b99237621e6f8f201d3934dfc64e53eb218a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2607/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2607/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2607/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/b131572db0751ce2b943bcd638160dee08b3a597","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:metaclient","ref":"metaclient","sha":"b131572db0751ce2b943bcd638160dee08b3a597","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2590\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe encountered that with resetting of the the `missingTopStatePartitionsBeyondThresholdGauge` to 0 have created several problems:\r\n* Missed Events to Ingraphs: If the value of `missingTopStatePartitionsBeyondThresholdGauge` gets reset to 0 before the refresh rate of Ingraph metric collector.\r\n* Negative Value in Metrics: If the top-state instance bounces back after the reset, the decrement will bring the value to Negative. We have also added a check to ensure that no negative value ever gets set.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n* Updated TestTopStateHandoffMetrics.testTopStateFailedHandoff\r\n* Added TestTopStateHandoffMetrics.testTopStateFailedUnrecoveredHandoff\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```console\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 799 classes\r\n[WARNING] Classes in bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' do not match with execution data.

They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-22T00:31:31Z","updated_at":"2023-08-23T20:09:13Z","closed_at":"2023-08-23T20:09:13Z","merged_at":"2023-08-23T20:09:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"792f21162be752eada8da8547a107884ff727b88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/60160f52c556e05e00aa3d8ab6dab000eb3855d9","head":{"label":"himanshukandwal:hkandwal/fix-missing-top-state-gauge-reset","ref":"hkandwal/fix-missing-top-state-gauge-reset","sha":"60160f52c556e05e00aa3d8ab6dab000eb3855d9","user":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676756685,"node_id":"R_kgDOKFZ8zQ","name":"helix","full_name":"himanshukandwal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal/helix","description":"Mirror

The current implementation attempts to read metrics from the MBeans Server, but it's possible that the metric might not be accessible at that moment. Thus, we need to use `verify` to validate the existence of the metric before comparing it with the `expectedMetricValues`. \r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n- `mvn test -Dtest=TestClusterAggregateMetrics`\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 9.185 s - in org.apache.helix.monitoring.mbeans.TestClusterAggregateMetrics\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/xiaxgao/IdeaProjects/helix_ps/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 944 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  18.994 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2023-08-21T16:07:37-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2596\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn WAGED: Emergency Pipeline, when checking for an active node down we are seeing internal ForkJoinPool threads getting stuck in blocking state, and FJP ending up creating a lot of worker threads. This happens when the cluster has a lot of resources with many partitions, and with parallel stream we try to evaluate the node activeness check for all the nodes without batching or back-pressure. \r\n\r\nIn the solution we are doing the evaluation linearly and using [allMatch](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#allMatch-java.util.function.Predicate-) we short-circuit if an inactive node is found.\r\n\r\nStacktrace:\r\n```console\r\njava.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException: java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException: Thread limit exceeded replacing blocked worker\r\n        at jdk.internal.reflect.GeneratedConstructorAccessor191.newInstance(Unknown Source) ~[?:?]\r\n        at jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:490) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask.getThrowableException(ForkJoinTask.java:600) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask.reportException(ForkJoinTask.java:678) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask.invoke(ForkJoinTask.java:737) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.stream.ForEachOps$ForEachOp.evaluateParallel(ForEachOps.java:159) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.stream.ForEachOps$ForEachOp$OfRef.evaluateParallel(ForEachOps.java:173) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.evaluate(AbstractPipeline.java:233) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline.forEach(ReferencePipeline.java:497) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$Head.forEach(ReferencePipeline.java:661) ~[?:?]\r\n        at org.apache.helix.controller.rebalancer.waged.WagedRebalancer.emergencyRebalance(WagedRebalancer.java:655) ~\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nValidated the solution with the existing test cases: \r\n* TestWagedRebalancer.testAlgorithmException\r\n* TestWagedRebalancer.testEmergencyRebalance\r\n* TestWagedRebalancer.testInvalidClusterStatus\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 15, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 799 classes\r\n[WARNING] Classes in bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' do not match with execution data.

They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-16T17:54:28Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T17:50:24Z","closed_at":"2024-03-06T17:50:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"23ac693f44873cc8b1781ae0697a865af35f2b7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2600/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2600/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2600/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/0921afab35be0088636db69864e1ae1ec38846cb","head":{"label":"himanshukandwal:hkandwal/fixed-fjp-threadpool-issue","ref":"hkandwal/fixed-fjp-threadpool-issue","sha":"0921afab35be0088636db69864e1ae1ec38846cb","user":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676756685,"node_id":"R_kgDOKFZ8zQ","name":"helix","full_name":"himanshukandwal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2348 #2551 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n* This test case disables and enables instances in a cluster and test whether P2P messages are correctly received by the host. Sometimes, the InstanceMessageCache receives stale relay messages, and it marks them as pending with future expiration. However, this would block future mastership handoff of the replica in the stale relay message. Eventually, the the new master handoff message will be sent directly from controller instead of using P2P communication. To mitigate this problem, we add 5 seconds sleep between disabling/enabling node operation to let any pending message expire.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage\r\n\r\nTriggered [testing ](https://github.com/MarkGaox/helix/pull/4)on my personal repo and verified everything works fine. \r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

InstanceConfig override for /partitionAssignment API to allow for simulating different assignment with different InstanceConfigs.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis change will allow callers of the /partitionAssignment API to pass a list of InstanceConfigs to override the existing ones. Callers will be able to do things like change the DOMAIN config to simulate FAULT_DOMAINs with skewed capacity and more.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] testComputePartitionAssignmentWaged \r\n      - Add another part of the test that uses the InstanceConfig inputField to replace HELIX_ENABLED in the Instance's persisted(ZK) InstanceConfig. While this particular use of the InstanceConfig may not be necessary since we already have ActivateInstance and DeactivateInstance fields, it is the easiest way to test that the InstanceConfig override can be passed.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 116.65 s - in org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-rest ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/zapinto/Documents/git/zpinto/helix/helix-rest/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Restful Interface' with 92 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:03 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2023-08-09T14:34:45-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nPreserves backwards compatibility by adding and not removing old inputFields\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2237 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMetaClient may get disconnected from underlying storage and get reconnected before session expire. The leader ephemeral node get's deleted only when session expire. However, on client side, client will only get 'session expired' event when connection is re-established. It will be too late if we send leader gone event when we get expire event.\r\nWe need to Proactively send leader gone event to prevent to prevent double leader.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestClientDisconnectAndReconnectBeforeExpire\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 27, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.751 s - in org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 27, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2565 \r\nFormatting of the \"reason\" key could vary depending on how data was sent to helix-rest. This change makes it so helix-rest always checks for a \"reason\" key and then consistently formats it in UPPERCASE\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nChecks the KV mapping passed to the helix-rest endpoint to determine if there a \"reason\" key present. We check for a case-insensitive key then set it to content, which then gets set as the value to the \"REASON\" (uppercase) key down the line. \r\n\r\nMore details can be seen in the linked issue, but we need to enforce this formatting because when this endpoint receives a non-JSON string, it sets it as the value to the \"REASON\" key. If the endpoint receivers a json string (KV map), then it will just use whatever key-value pairs are passed to it and does not enforce UPPERCASE formatting for the reason key. This change ensures that if a reason key is present, it will always appear as \"REASON\" . This is important as Java maps are case sensitive and keys of different casing are functionally two different keys and do not allow customers to easily programmatically access the reason key\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nUpdated testEnableDisableMaintenanceMode() in testClusterAccessor.java to assert KV map of {\"reason\": \"Test reason\"} gets stored as {\"REASON\": \"Test reason\"}\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)","created_at":"2023-08-02T22:32:40Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T21:03:14Z","closed_at":"2023-08-22T21:03:14Z","merged_at":"2023-08-22T21:03:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"b6ae480d256fba7705bb8dc8331123eec702eff9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/091ebb098ffcbeb62093ee31a4a4899f8f075991","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:master","ref":"master","sha":"091ebb098ffcbeb62093ee31a4a4899f8f075991","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nLockClient currently uses ZNRecord serializer. Abstracting away any zookeeper specifics and keeping the code easier to understand, LockInfoSerializer is created to serialize and deserialize the LockInfo object used in LockClient.\r\nFurthermore, the old LockInfo structure would show the simplefields as their own separate fields in ZooKeeper. Changing that so the ZNRecord represents all parameters of the lock in ZooKeeper as a field in SimpleFields.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCreated the LockInfoSerializer which extends the ZNRecordSerializer. Modified LockClient to use this serializer and updated the LockClient test case to show that it works.\r\nModified the LockInfo object so that all fields appear as fields in simplefield in Zookeeper as opposed to it's own separate field.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nLockClientTest.java\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-27T15:57:56Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T16:41:59Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T16:41:59Z","merged_at":"2023-08-02T16:41:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d4e2f5f7bb5ede3abd658ac4f151a4e0435b648","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2580/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2580/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2580/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/958cdb511c6c50abd60f189f17ef6a7609fa0b27","head":{"label":"Marcosrico:lockclient","ref":"lockclient","sha":"958cdb511c6c50abd60f189f17ef6a7609fa0b27","user":{"login":"Marcosrico","id":55266861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjY2ODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55266861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico","html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":530316861,"node_id":"R_kgDOH5v-PQ","name":"helix","full_name":"Marcosrico/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Marcosrico","id":55266861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjY2ODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55266861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico","html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nThere was a race condition where the threads running the specific puppies would terminate, leading to the created znodes to be deleted. Because there were listeners on those nodes, they would increase the event change counter when the threads had already finished, causing the tests to fail.\r\nCode cleanup stems from bug: https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2577\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRemoved the cleanup section of the CRUD puppies (as cleanup will happen in the test case). Many of the cleanups weren't necessary and the ones that were (for CreatePuppy) was what caused the race condition.\r\nRe-structured code in AbstractPuppy for less redundancy and modified some print statements for easier readability.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestMultiThreadStressZKClient.java\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-27T13:52:11Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T16:46:27Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T16:46:26Z","merged_at":"2023-08-02T16:46:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9c8332a6a965763f7cc7b0092a32e7cd195e236","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/7d7e1ad71d173168d0f0836f75614df96a439e57","head":{"label":"Marcosrico:puppy","ref":"puppy","sha":"7d7e1ad71d173168d0f0836f75614df96a439e57","user":{"login":"Marcosrico","id":55266861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjY2ODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55266861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico","html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":530316861,"node_id":"R_kgDOH5v-PQ","name":"helix","full_name":"Marcosrico/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Marcosrico","id":55266861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjY2ODYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55266861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico","html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Marcosrico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Marcosrico/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\nWAGED n - n+1 - adds the logic whether to filter out the host from map-field of idealState if the host doesn't have capacity based on currentState and pending messages. \r\n\r\nTypically bootstrapping nodes don't appear in currentState and hence pendingMessages are required to be looked at.\r\n\r\nThere were 2 problems:\r\n1. We were looking at CurrentStateOutput.pendingMessages. These messages are filtered from InstanceMessagesCache based on current state availability. Bootstrapping messages don't have CurrentState and hence they don't show up in pending message queue at all.\r\n2. Second problem was StateModelDefinition priority  numeric values are in reverse order. MASTER is 0 while SLAVE value is 1. I was comparing 'from() < to()' state to indicate it is upward state change but given that actual priority value are in reverse order, i had to change.\r\nHere is example of MasterSlaveSMD: https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/master/helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/model/MasterSlaveSMD.java#L56\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\ntestReduceInstanceCapacity\r\nAdded new test: TestWagedLoadedCluster.java\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterMaintenanceMode.testMaintenanceHistory:412 expected:<EXIT> but was:<ENTER>\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:180 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1335, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0-M3:test (default-test) on project helix-core: There are test failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-27T10:42:08Z","updated_at":"2023-07-28T00:09:31Z","closed_at":"2023-07-27T23:22:47Z","merged_at":"2023-07-27T23:22:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"9701d40064e8ded9c1632627c1a52f2390218fab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2578/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2578/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2578/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/64f561e73c14f1c55b4e3e6da48da0efd5eb2439","head":{"label":"desaikomal:waged-3","ref":"waged-3","sha":"64f561e73c14f1c55b4e3e6da48da0efd5eb2439","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Fix stoppable parallel instances API swallowing error\r\n- Add proper error handling for RESTConfig getBaseUrl method(asserts may not throw AssertionException if assertEnabled is specifically enabled in jvm config)\r\n- Remove assumption that instance name contains port information while maintaining backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen fetching the result of StoppableChecks fails, helix-rest stoppable API will return a response with status 200; however, the instances passed to the API will not be in the `instance_stoppable_parallel` or `instance_not_stoppable_with_reasons` field. This is because we are catching the exception in `filterInstancesForNextCheck` and not raising an exception. We need to raise this exception to surface the issue to the caller.\r\n\r\nRESTConfig model provides a method to generate the instance's baseUrl from the `CUSTOMIZED_HEALTH_URL` simpleField in REST Config znode. Previously, there were assert statements to check if baseUrl contained \"*\". This assert will not be executed at runtime unless assertEnabled jvm config is set to true. Instead we add error handling to check if baseUrl is null and if it has \"*\".\r\n\r\nWe cannot necessarily assume that all instance names contain the <instanceVip>_<port>. We remove this assumption while also preserving old logic if instance name has port.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] TestRESTConfig\r\n  - [x] testGetBaseUrlValid for instance name without port and with port + valid CUSTOMIZED_HEALTH_URL\r\n  - [x] testGetBaseUrlInvalid for invalid CUSTOMIZED_HEALTH_URL\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n➜  helix git:(fix_parallel_stoppable_api_swallows_exception) ✗ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestRESTConfig -pl=helix-core          \r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.helix:metrics-common:bundle:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n[WARNING] 'build.pluginManagement.plugins.plugin.(groupId:artifactId)' must be unique but found duplicate declaration of plugin org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin @ org.apache.helix:helix:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT, /Users/zapinto/Documents/git/zpinto/helix/pom.xml, line 678, column 17\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for org.apache.helix:helix:pom:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n[WARNING] 'build.pluginManagement.plugins.plugin.(groupId:artifactId)' must be unique but found duplicate declaration of plugin org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-javadoc-plugin @ line 678, column 17\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they threaten the stability of your build.\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[WARNING] For this reason, future Maven versions might no longer support building such malformed projects.\r\n[WARNING] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --------------------< org.apache.helix:helix-core >---------------------\r\n[INFO] Building Apache Helix :: Core 1.3.1-SNAPSHOT\r\n[INFO]   from pom.xml\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------[ bundle ]-------------------------------\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-maven-version) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-java-version) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- enforcer:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-output-timestamp-property) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:prepare-agent (default) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] argLine set to -javaagent:/Users/zapinto/.m2/repository/org/jacoco/org.jacoco.agent/0.8.6/org.jacoco.agent-0.8.6-runtime.jar=destfile=/Users/zapinto/Documents/git/zpinto/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- remote-resources:1.7.0:process (process-resource-bundles) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Preparing remote bundle org.apache:apache-jar-resource-bundle:1.4\r\n[INFO] Copying 3 resources from 1 bundle.\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- resources:3.2.0:resources (default-resources) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered resources.\r\n[INFO] Using 'UTF-8' encoding to copy filtered properties files.\r\n[INFO] Copying 4 resources\r\n[INFO] Copying 0 resource\r\n[INFO] Copying 3 resources\r\n[INFO] The encoding used to copy filtered properties files have not been set.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn change: https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2546\r\nin method, processPendingMessage() - i was processing upward ST  but my condition assumed that we are bootstrapping from INIT to OFFLINE and that's when space should be accounted for. \r\nWhen our team did the experiment, realized that bootstrapping is actually OFFLINE to SLAVE. \r\n\r\nSo instead of looking at message.ToState(), should be looking at message.FromState().\r\n\r\nSince this feature is not yet mature, adding a bit more logs to help in debugging the failures. Once this has been validated, will convert the info() messages to debug() messages.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testNoThrottleOnDisabledInstance:231->setupEnvironment:317->setupCluster:436 » ZkClient\r\n[ERROR]   TestZkConnectionLost.testDisconnectWhenConnectionBreak:140 » ThreadTimeout Met...\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterMaintenanceMode.testMaintenanceHistory:412 expected:<EXIT> but was:<ENTER>\r\n[ERROR]   TestP2PNoDuplicatedMessage.testP2PStateTransitionEnabled:180 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeout.testStateTransitionTimeOut:170 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestWagedRebalanceFaultZone.testAddZone:288 expected:<true> but was:<false> \r\n[ERROR]   TestRecurringJobQueue.testDeletingRecurrentQueueWithHistory:298 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1334, Failures: 8, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

for parallel instances stoppable API reordering the zoneList when a user provides their own zone_order.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n- NA/new issue\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen a user provides their own zone_order when using the parallel instances stoppable API in helix-rest, that order should be respected when selecting the zone to check. This will fix that by ensuring the provided zone_order is not alphabetically re-ordered as it is when a zone_order is not provided.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] TestInstancesAccessor#testInstanceStoppable_zoneBased_zoneOrder\r\n   - Ensures that zone2 is selected when provided a zone_order of zone2,zone1\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- NA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-20T00:23:21Z","updated_at":"2023-07-20T21:11:27Z","closed_at":"2023-07-20T21:11:27Z","merged_at":"2023-07-20T21:11:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9e678f8da04ad7c28171139bc1bd64e8e221ff8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2566/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2566/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2566/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/9879f973d98441143e3c96d9432bf409c2d1af45","head":{"label":"zpinto:fix_zone_order_stoppable","ref":"fix_zone_order_stoppable","sha":"9879f973d98441143e3c96d9432bf409c2d1af45","user":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627637862,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWj-Zg","name":"helix","full_name":"zpinto/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zpinto","id":20071182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20071182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto","html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zpinto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zpinto/helix","description":"Apache

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix Customized View allows customers to view aggregated view from various instances. When an instance ungracefully dies, the customizedState for that instance is not cleaned up. When this ungraceful instance comes back online, before it can reset the customizedState, Helix controller will report stale data from the previous session. \r\nDuring graceful shutdown, user explicitly resets the state in per-instance view but during ungraceful shutdown, it doesn't clean up. This change deletes the per-instance customized state in live-instance down callback listener.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\ntestDeleteInstanceCustomizedStateAggregation()\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nmvn test is in progress will update it here as soon as it finishes it.\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-18T23:17:32Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T15:39:56Z","closed_at":"2023-07-21T15:39:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8ead6534afc34744d36044292c2472a7d5ab60a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/85d0b4e05a0d067876685a957794b6ef2ada1304","head":{"label":"desaikomal:customized-view","ref":"customized-view","sha":"85d0b4e05a0d067876685a957794b6ef2ada1304","user":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":452080859,"node_id":"R_kgDOGvI02w","name":"helix","full_name":"desaikomal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"desaikomal","id":98000016,"node_id":"U_kgDOBddckA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98000016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal","html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/desaikomal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/desaikomal/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\nHelix-rest's getClusterMaintenanceSignal will state the cluster is NOT in maintenance node if the maintenance znode has no data.

This because dataAccessor.getProperty() will return null if the key does not exist in the snapshot.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2554\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFix issue 2554.\r\nZkClient tries to resubscribe one time watcher when reading an entry that has listener subscribed. In metaclient use case, we do not need to resubscribe as we are using persist watcher.\r\nThis change checks is persist watcher label is true. Only resubscribe if not using persist watcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestZkMetaclient.testChangeListener()\r\nThis new test was constantly failing before the fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-11T04:29:22Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T04:07:18Z","closed_at":"2023-07-13T17:25:10Z","merged_at":"2023-07-13T17:25:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c7cc20332ef76c7f36f388e39392b77cd56a8c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2555/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2555/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2555/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/d7a294317b77bdb9ea4a9c8ad6ed21a8a065320e","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:watcher","ref":"watcher","sha":"d7a294317b77bdb9ea4a9c8ad6ed21a8a065320e","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2552 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhat is added :\r\n1. When top state for a partition is missing beyond threshold then we increase failed top state and missing top state beyond threshold counters. But in this code paths we have not added any logs. Adding logs in this code path to indicate for long the top state is been missing.\r\n2. When top state is recovered if it's recovered on same instance within threshold then only the stats are reported as well logs are emitted. Added a TODO to fix this and fixed logging for this code path.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\nmvn test -Dtest=TestTopStateHandoffMetrics\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 20.227 s - in org.apache.helix.monitoring.mbeans.TestTopStateHandoffMetrics\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 12, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO]\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-11T00:19:58Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T18:25:18Z","closed_at":"2023-07-12T18:25:18Z","merged_at":"2023-07-12T18:25:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0df597ec48b69a074dc1973d0b56327b09f3e4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/3a6793f6dc33b71e549019c12eb7e72348df6221","head":{"label":"rahulrane50:topstate_metric_logs","ref":"topstate_metric_logs","sha":"3a6793f6dc33b71e549019c12eb7e72348df6221","user":{"login":"rahulrane50","id":23309709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzA5NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23309709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50","html_url":"https://github.com/rahulrane50","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467212008,"node_id":"R_kgDOG9kW6A","name":"helix","full_name":"rahulrane50/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rahulrane50","id":23309709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzA5NzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23309709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50","html_url":"https://github.com/rahulrane50","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulrane50/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rahulrane50/helix","description":"Mirror

are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe skeleton / logic of the multithreading stress testing. We are using a concept called \"puppies\" to add in chaos to stress testing. Each puppy that extends the AbstractPuppy class represents one action (i.e. zk.CreatePuppy will create nodes in zk at specified path). The PuppyManager manages puppys by executing them and stopping them when indicated time limit is reached.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2493 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis change is focused on changes to core logic where during assigning the STATE to the instances, we decide if instance has the required capacity.\r\n\r\nThis change NOW combines - core logic, code-consolidation, moving processing of pending message/current state to Data Process stage.  \r\n\r\nI also combined the pending test-case review and enabled the Assert to ensure we never cross the capacity.  \r\n\r\nThe core logic is as follows:\r\nPre-Compute stage\r\n------------------\r\n- in WAGED rebalancer: computeNewIdealState, we create 'WagedInstanceCapacity' which tracks instance capacity and WeightProvider for partitions. These changes were introduced in Part-1.\r\n- We process the pending messages for the resources where if we are moving out partition but not yet moved, we reduce the capacity.\r\n\r\nOnce we compute the ideal state, we go through preference list sorting. There are no changes to the pure computational change.\r\n\r\nPost-compute stage\r\n------------------\r\nWe look at the current-state as well as ideal state, we combine the list and do the sorting of the nodes. We then pick up only the required numReplica nodes.\r\n\r\nThis is where we look at the nodes which are \"NEW\" (ie. not in currentState) and check if it has the required capacity to hold the new partition. If not, we remove it from combined list.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nNew test: TestWagedClusterExpansion has been added. \r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nTesting done:\r\nHave run through the mvn test (10 times)\r\nIn another change, I have added a new test case and verified that it works. [ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestNoThrottleDisabledPartitions.testDisablingTopStateReplicaByDisablingInstance:98 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterMaintenanceMode.testMaintenanceHistory:412 expected:<EXIT> but was:<ENTER>\r\n[ERROR]   TestParticipantFreeze.testUnfreezeParticipant:228 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestRecurringJobQueue.testDeletingRecurrentQueueWithHistory:298 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1335, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2237 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis change add a new API getDataAndStat to metaclient. It returns the data and it's stats.\r\nThis API is needed when doing check and then delete/create in transactional setting, check operation requires version parameter. Having `getDataAndStat` allows user to read data, check if current data meet requirement, and use the version in following transaction operation. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\ntestGetDataAndStat\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-14T16:15:58Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T16:05:04Z","closed_at":"2023-06-21T16:05:03Z","merged_at":"2023-06-21T16:05:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"873b071f3dd9bc42ae8e381c6b1ca769a4d5fe12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2535/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2535/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2535/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/31ff7df547b2d3d7ca06512d070611dda0317111","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:readNsts","ref":"readNsts","sha":"31ff7df547b2d3d7ca06512d070611dda0317111","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror
