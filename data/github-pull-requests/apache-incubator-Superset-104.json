SUMMARY\r\nThis pr is based off feedback from users with slow loading home page from api calls. The initial setup for page load was to batch call for all data on page load. This pr separates out api calls for recent activity and run mine's api calls in parallel on page load. This should allow some data to show faster on homepage without depending on long api requests.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nToday `master` was broken for a couple of hours because a merge conflict of db migrations. This can happen when two PRs with db migrations that point to the same revision merge separately right after one another---since we don't rerun CI after merges, it's hard to catch this before merging.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new workflow that checks and notifies the PR author of potential db migration conflicts. It runs when an update of the db migration scripts is pushed to any branch, scans all open PRs that are using said branch as the base branch, and checks whether they also update the migration scripts. If yes, then a comment is sent to remind the PR author to rebase the branch. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\nThe DatabaseSelector component was very complex and had several responsibilities, in addition to developing several rerenders that were not necessary.\r\n\r\n#### First Step\r\nThe first step was to separate the functions that were inside the component into hooks. Leaving this out we have some direct improvements:\r\n- Improved readability (principle of single responsibility and cleaner code)\r\n- Allow use of useRef to prevent unnecessary rerenders\r\n- Test possibility\r\n\r\nFor the functions, the same structure is followed. There is a factory, which takes as an argument functions that will be used within the original function (usually the \"setSomething\") and returns a function with the same input and behavior as the original function. This factory is used to initialize a `useRef` and has a `useEffect` to update the refs when any prop is changed.\r\nThis way, the component only renders again when there is a need to update the UI, but the functions are always with the current props and states.\r\n\r\n#### Second step\r\nThere were still 4 components inside `DatabaseSelector`, using names like `renderDatabaseSelect`.\r\nEach of these has been separated into a single component. Facilitating testing, making the code cleaner, and facilitating future maintenance.\r\nEven by separating the components of the behavior it was maintained and the interface was kept as similar as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nNo behavior change in the application. All tests must pass correctly.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-06T01:11:39Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T17:07:14Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T17:07:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba4d89de93ef7eed24805e4aad81c6c6f3de1505","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1151892558,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTUxODkyNTU4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:many-files","name":"risk:many-files","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"Change

SUMMARY\r\nWe are seeing some errors of runQuery being instantiated with a query that has already been created server-side, resulting in a duplicate client_id error. The second api call happens exactly one minute from the first. I haven't been able to recreate the cause, but I looked for instances where we were possibly dispatching `runQuery` with an existing query. I created a new action called `reRunQuery` that removes the id and generates a new one, and then dispatches `runQuery`\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nno visual

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR removes `Select` duplication by moving old `src/common/components/Select` to `src/components/Select` folder. To achieve that, the old component was renamed to `NativeSelect`. Currently, our `Select` component uses `react-select` but we should migrate it to AntD so this PR is an intermediary step in our refactoring process with the objective of organizing all `Select` in the same folder.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1 - Execute all tests.\r\n2 - All tests should pass.\r\n\r\n@rusackas @junlincc \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nThis bug was reported internally, when you try to view in sql lab from a druid datasource with the native druid connector, it causes a JS error in sql lab.

SUMMARY\r\nWhen creating a Graph Chart with the feature flag `ENABLE_EXPLORE_DRAG_AND_DROP ` activated, the application freezes on a white screen.\r\n\r\n#### Scope\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to resolve the bug with as little impact as possible on the application\r\n\r\n#### Debuging\r\nWhen a chart (Graph) is created several error messages are displayed on the console. One of the messages is\r\n```\r\nWarning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `options` of type `object` supplied to `SelectControl`, expected `array`.\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"1042\" alt=\"Captura de Tela 2021-03-04 às 3 37 44 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1014611/110012733-9b5cff80-7cff-11eb-82cd-e5252fb423d0.png\">\r\n\r\n#### Proposed solution\r\nAs the interface is not very clear, and for some reason the contract was changed, the idea of the solution is to change this `prop` **only in the case where the error occurred** and not impact any other part of the application that may be using this data.\r\n\r\nFor this, only the `src/explore/components/Control.tsx` component was changed, transforming the `options` props into an array only for the use of `SelectControl`.\r\n\r\n### AFTER \r\n<img width=\"1676\" alt=\"Captura de Tela 2021-03-04 às 4 22 03 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1014611/110018220-d5c99b00-7d05-11eb-99f2-7e32d0413d3f.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nNo behavior has been changed, so the application should work normally. In addition, all tests already implemented should pass correctly.\r\n\r\nTo test if this fix is working correctly, it is necessary to activate the feature flag:`ENABLE_EXPLORE_DRAG_AND_DROP` \r\n(The activation is not in this PR because it is not intended to change any application's behavior.)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe bug was reported in this comment: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13210#issuecomment-788097589\r\n\r\n@junlincc @ktmud

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new CLI option to load big/wide tables into Superset. The goal is to create tables with synthetic data that help developers test new features and DB migrations in realistic scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis first PR just adds a function called `add_data` that generates the data given a schema. When running `superset load-examples -b` it will also create a wide table with 100 columns, to help test SQL Lab (which behaves differently if the table has more than 50 columns).\r\n\r\nThe next steps include adding more tables, as well as implementing functionality to add more rows to the Superset models, to help benchmark DB migrations.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nRan `superset load-examples -b -t` and verified that the table `wide_table` was created, with 1000 rows and 100 columns.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nWe see errors editing the metadata for dashboards that were imported using the v0 import/export feature. I'm adding those fields to the DashboardJSONMetadataSchema so we don't see those errors on validation. I'm adding these fields to the schema instead of removing them because the v0 import/export feature [uses](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/45738ffc1dfe94deb6578b6e5b0d6687558969e9/superset/dashboards/commands/importers/v0.py#L49-L50) them. \r\n\r\nI tested this change by editing a chart with these fields, let me know if there's anything else to test with this change.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nI tested editing a chart that had these fields in the dashboard `json_metadata`.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to improve the readability and maintainability of component `src/components/dataViewCommon/TableCollection.tsx`.\r\n\r\n#### Observed issues:\r\nHigh complexity, makes the code more difficult to understand and to test.\r\n**Proposed solution:** Divide the component into smaller, more specialized components.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Solution description\r\nThe component was initially divided into 2:  `TableCollectionHead` and `TableCollectionBody`\r\nAs the table's data model is complex, the tests were intended to just ensure that the pros were being send correctly to these components.\r\n\r\nThe `TableCollectionHead` is intended to render the table's head (`<thead />`). For this, it was divided into 2. The `TableCollectionHead` itself that takes care of the re-rendering of the lines (`<tr>`) and the `TableCollectionHeadCol` which takes care of the rendering of the cells (`<td>`).\r\nThe testing strategy of TableCollectionHead is also just to ensure that an object that minimally respects the interface of the `react-table` and sends the correct props to `TableCollectionHeadCol`.\r\nThe`TableCollectionHeadCol` test targets all states/behaviors variations supported by the component.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe component `TableCollectionBody` was also initially divided into 2 components `TableCollectionLoading` and `TableCollectionBodyContent`.\r\n`TableCollectionLoading` is responsible for rendering when the table is in the loading state and has no information. The testing strategy is to cover the behaviors and ensure that the props are sent correctly to the component `TableCollectionCell`\r\nThe component `TableCollectionBodyContent` is responsible for rendering the data (the rows / `<tr>`) of the table. The testing strategy also consists of covering possible behaviors and sending the correct props to `TableCollectionCell`\r\n`TableCollectionCell` is responsible for rendering a table cell (`<td>`), either containing data or in a loading state. The testing strategy consists of verifying that when receiving the cell data (props), it will behave properly.\r\n\r\nIn summary, `TableCollection`, `TableCollectionHead`, `TableCollectionBody`, `TableCollectionLoading` and `TableCollectionBodyContent` are responsible for sending the pops to a component below in your tree. Their tests are focused on ensuring that the props are being sent correctly.\r\n`TableCollectionHeadCol` and `TableCollectionHeadCol` are responsible for render the table cells (`<td>/<th>`). The testing of these components is focused on behavior and correct rendering.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nNo changes in behavior should occur and all tests must

SUMMARY\r\nRemoves unused `Hotkeys` component\r\n\r\nHotkeys were removed in #12008 with the following comment from @rusackas:\r\n\r\n> Heya... I took those out. At least for me, most of them don't actually work, so I figured it wouldn't be missed.\r\n> \r\n> We can certainly put it back in if it's a big deal, but I'd rather design/implement a more global keyboard shortcut helper, e.g. hover/click a global item, and all the bits of UI with keyboard shortcuts light up. For example, the Run button would get a little ctrl-r tooltip next to it.\r\n\r\nSince the component wasn't being used I removed it.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1 - Execute all tests\r\n2 - All tests should pass\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

review reported here: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13210#issuecomment-788097589\r\n\r\nWhen entering a new chart, an error occurs and the application freezes.\r\nThe error message points out that it is because an array is expected but an object is being sent.\r\nAs shown in the image:\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"Captura de Tela 2021-03-01 às 6 55 17 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1014611/109565207-e2a97d00-7ac0-11eb-8a77-c92e1ed5fecc.png\">\r\n\r\nWith this fix, I started to send the object's values as an array:\r\n<img

stopped freezing, but I was unable to test if it is working correctly:\r\n<img width=\"1667\" alt=\"Captura de Tela 2021-03-01 às 7 01 16 PM\"

Some typescript components are also incorrectly typed. (Missing properties that are being used in other components. \"options\" was one of those properties that was missing.\r\n- Perhaps this fix can generate some unwanted side effects on others charts. Before deciding whether it actually solved anything, it is important to check if the others charts are working correctly.\r\n- Component that was giving exception and freezing the application: `src/explore/components/Control.tsx`\r\n\r\nMy guess:\r\nWhen activating the Feature Flag, some changes in the response of the APIS started to cause this unwanted behavior.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-01T22:14:06Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T14:00:36Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T19:31:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4bbdb709d8c0f895bb41999545f1b6f893d885ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2592586747,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTkyNTg2NzQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/explore","name":"explore","color":"BFDADC","default":false,"description":"Namespace

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAdds a listener for the `worker_process_init` Celery [signal](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/4.4.2/userguide/signals.html#worker-process-init) that disposes of and resets the SQLAlchemy connection pool being passed to the forked process.\r\n\r\nResolves the intermittent `sqlalchemy.exc.NoSuchColumnError` reported in #10530 and #12766 and the following error reported in #9860:\r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.DatabaseError: (psycopg2.DatabaseError) error with status PGRES_TUPLES_OK and no message from the libpq\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fix is primarily related to the default `prefork` Celery execution pool, but was also tested with the following pool invocations:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncelery worker --app=superset.tasks.celery_app:app -Ofair -l INFO\r\n```\r\n```\r\ncelery worker --app=superset.tasks.celery_app:app --pool=threads -c 12 -l INFO\r\n```\r\n```\r\ncelery worker --app=superset.tasks.celery_app:app --pool=gevent -c 12 -l INFO\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis configuration was tested with [async queries](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/11499) enabled to place load on the celery workers, in both standalone and Docker-based workflows.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a fix for a client-side race condition in loading charts asynchronously (fixes #12913).\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttps://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/connections.html#engine-disposal\r\nhttps://www.yangster.ca/post/not-the-same-pre-fork-worker-model/\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nAsynchronous tasks should run without `sqlalchemy.exc.NoSuchColumnError` when celery is run in `prefork` mode.  See #10530 and #12766 for reproducability.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI'm really perplexed why this issue has recently surfaced and/or been reported and why it only applies to certain visualization types (is there any chance [this](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/master/packages/superset-ui-core/src/query/extractExtras.ts) is overridden by various chart types), but it seems like the Python date format wasn't being adhered to due to poorly formed extra time-range-endpoints.\r\n\r\nMore specifically for the QueryObject the `extra` fields are coming from `superset-ui` where, if defined, the `time_range_endpoints` is a tuple of strings which are never converted to a tuple of `TimeRangeEndpoint` enums and thus [this](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/0a00153375fb69891c2a9f0115a33cdf5551b2d6/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L309) check is false meaning the default date format is never adhered to.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOptimize CodeCov config to\r\n\r\n1. Always let GitHub CodeCov checks pass because we don't always report all test coverage (because of [conditional CI jobs](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/12583))\r\n2. Add more detailed flags for coverage [uploads](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/superset/commit/a700205d75abf8ad628e063c3bbf12c8625330fc/build)\r\n3. Run tests also on workflow file changes\r\n\r\nIt seems the CodeCov App has recently been enabled in this repo (#9930), which is good, but it starts to block some PRs on status check due to false alarms of decreased test coverage.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"947\" alt=\"blocked\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/109105158-2fb4da00-76e2-11eb-8955-8cff809f415d.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is because:\r\n\r\n1. The target coverage setting is set to \"auto\", which will report any decrease in test coverage\r\n2. We conditionally skip Python tests for pure frontend changes (and vice versa), hence certain PRs will never have the full test coverage reported.\r\n3. Sometimes frontend and backend workflows are delayed in queue and run in very different time. After wait for a while, CodeCov may come to believe the full CI has finished, therefore reporting only partial coverage from the already finished jobs.\r\n\r\nThe [`after_n_builds`](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/notifications) config is designed to address this issue, but since we don't know which jobs will run for each PR, we can't really set a meaningful value for this config.\r\n\r\nI'm setting it to 4 because for Python tests there are 5 uploads (mysql, postgres, sqlite, hive, presto),  and for frontend, there are 4 ([unit tests](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/59d4e8759a0490e6b5bca8cfa87cbf1191b486d2/.github/workflows/superset-frontend.yml#L48) + Cypress * 3).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED
