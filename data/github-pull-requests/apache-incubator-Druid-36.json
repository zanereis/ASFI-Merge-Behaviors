testing mm-less druid with istio-proxy, I noticed that when you have a controller that automatically injects the sidecar for all pods in a namespace.  The istio-proxy sidecar gets injected as the first container.  The problem here was the assumption that the first container was always the `druid` container.  \r\n\r\nI added a configuration option which should assist with this. \r\n\r\nif you are running with `druid.indexer.runner.sidecarSupport=true`\r\n\r\nyou can specify `druid.indexer.runner.primaryContainerName=<overlord_container_name>` to be the container name for your overlord. \r\n\r\nFor example if we have this for your overlord podSpec: \r\n\r\n```\r\nspec:\r\n  containers:\r\n      - image: istio:latest\r\n        name: istio-proxy\r\n      - image: druid:latest\r\n        name: druid-overlord\r\n      - image: splunk:latest\r\n        name: splunk\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your istio is automatically injected by a controller then you would specify this in your overlord config: \r\n```\r\ndruid.indexer.runner.primaryContainerName=druid-overlord\r\n```\r\n\r\nI encountered this problem exactly, patched our druid which fixed the problem on our clusters.

Description\r\nThis PR introduces a new experimental mode for schema discovery which is powered by the 'nested' column indexer. To accompany this, there are also some changes to the nested column selector behavior in the case that the column consists of a single typed 'root' literal column (so no nested data), to allow nested columns to mimic the column type of this root literal. \r\n\r\nThe result is a schema discovery mode which can produce columns of the correct type rather than being limited to all columns being `STRING` typed with the current schemaless behavior. Like existing schemaless ingestion, the `timestampSpec` must still be defined, perhaps future enhancements could add automatic time column selection. Also in this PR all discovered columns are writing out full nested columns, a future PR will add optimizations to the nested column serializer to only store what is necessary.\r\n\r\nI think the most compelling use case for this is with streaming ingestion, since it allows for effortless support of schema evolution.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nFor example, imagine I have a kafka topic, `schemafree`. With the changes in this PR, we can define a very minimal ingestion spec:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"kafka\",\r\n  \"spec\": {\r\n    \"ioConfig\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"kafka\",\r\n      \"consumerProperties\": {\r\n        \"bootstrap.servers\": \"localhost:9092\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"topic\": \"schemafree\",\r\n      \"inputFormat\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"json\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"tuningConfig\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"kafka\",\r\n      \"appendableIndexSpec\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"onheap\",\r\n        \"useNestedColumnIndexerForSchemaDiscovery\": true\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"dataSchema\": {\r\n      \"dataSource\": \"schemafree\",\r\n      \"timestampSpec\": {\r\n        \"column\": \"time\",\r\n        \"format\": \"iso\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"dimensionsSpec\":{}\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we send a first batch of events to our topic:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"time\":\"2023-01-07T00:00:00Z\", \"some_long\":1234, \"some_double\":1.23, \"some_string\":\"a\", \"some_variant\":\"a\"}\r\n{\"time\":\"2023-01-07T01:00:00Z\", \"some_long\":5678, \"some_double\":4.56, \"some_string\":\"b\", \"some_variant\":1}\r\n{\"time\":\"2023-01-07T01:10:00Z\", \"some_long\":1111, \"some_string\":\"c\", \"some_variant\":2.2}\r\n{\"time\":\"2023-01-07T01:20:00Z\", \"some_double\":11.11, \"some_variant\":1}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`useNestedColumnIndexerForSchemaDiscovery` set on `appendableIndexSpec` of the `tuningConfig` tells the `IncrementalIndex` to use a `NestedColumnIndexer` for any discovered dimensions instead of a `StringDimensionIndexer`. The new mimic behavior of nested column selectors then allows queries to see these discovered columns as their correct type:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1215\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-09 at 10 46 21 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/211491200-8414de07-aed6-4cf2-b8ea-046d9da3a5fd.png\">\r\n\r\nAdding additional events:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"time\":\"2023-01-07T00:00:00Z\", \"other_long\": 1111, \"other_double\":2.22, \"other_string\": \"zz\"}\r\n{\"time\":\"2023-01-07T00:00:00Z\", \"other_long\": 2222, \"other_double\":3.33, \"other_string\": \"yy\"}\r\n{\"time\":\"2023-01-07T00:00:00Z\", \"other_long\": 3333, \"other_double\":4.44, \"other_string\": \"xx\"}\r\n{\"time\":\"2023-01-07T00:00:00Z\", \"other_long\": 4444, \"other_double\":5.55, \"other_string\": \"ww\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthese are picked up as well:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1215\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-09 at 10 47 19 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/211492154-fcf3950c-1a28-4c10-8345-cf2e30879114.png\">\r\n\r\nThe nested column selectors are using the same nested literal column selectors that are used for the nested virtual columns that back SQL functions like `JSON_VALUE`, so the performance is approximately the same as if these were regular literal columns, and we can query them as if they were such, grouping and aggregating and so on:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1217\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-09 at 11 29 48 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/211492438-7a763a2c-ee65-4933-bfc9-bd584276bf07.png\">\r\n\r\n#### Follow-up work\r\nThe most important pieces to follow are:\r\n* improving nested column serializer to optimize the root literal case\r\n* refactor flattener machinery which provides column discovery to include 'nested' columns... ironically right now these are filtered out so that columns with actual nested data will not be automatically ingested even though the nested column indexer was literally built for this\r\n* refactor column merging code to use something more purpose built than `ColumnCapabilities` for segment merging/picking column handlers/etc, something like `ColumnFormat` or `ColumnShape`. For now I have added the concept of 'handler' capabilities as a crutch to allow merging to choose the nested column merger even though the column capabilities reports as a `STRING` or `LONG` or whatever with nested columns, but going forward i think something nicer can be built, more on this later\r\n* i'm sure i'm forgetting other things 🙃 \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

adds implementations of semantic interfaces\r\nto optimize (eliminate object creation) the\r\nwindow processing on top of an ArrayListSegment.\r\n\r\nTests are also added to cover the interplay\r\nbetween the semantic interfaces that are expected\r\nfor this use case\r\n\r\nThe actual business logic all exists inside of `ArrayListRowsAndColumns` so a review should start there.  The tests in `CombinedSemanticInterfacesTest` are also of particular note for the interoperation dealt with here.\r\n\r\nAside from the changes in those files, most of the other changes are renames/cleanups/refactors, there's also a few extra tests added and some fixes for warnings thrown in here and there.\r\n\r\nThere is also a bit of cleanup in the PR deleting the no-longer-used `WindowAggregateProcessor` and all of the things that it solely depended on.  This should've been done as part of the frame PR but was overlooked.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

aggregate of all direct and transitive dependencies of a project. The US Government (based on NIST recommendations) currently accepts only the three most popular SBOM standards as valid, namely: [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), [Software Identification (SWID) tag](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/Software-Identification-SWID), [Software Package Data Exchange® (SPDX)](https://spdx.dev/).\r\n\r\nWe can use one of the Maven plugin, [CycloneDX maven plugin](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin), a lightweight software bill of materials (SBOM) standard designed for use in application security contexts and supply chain component analysis.\r\n\r\nhttps://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html#misc\r\n\r\n**The expected results**\r\n```\r\n$ mvn install -DskipTests\r\n...\r\n\r\n$ ls -al

Description\r\nFound the issue with the \"[Combine old data with new data and overwrite](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/tutorial-update-data.html#combine-old-data-with-new-data-and-overwrite)\" section in the Druid update data tutorial.\r\nThe ingestion (file spec [updates-append-index2.json](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/examples/quickstart/tutorial/updates-append-index2.json)) ) uses combining input source type with two different types: `druid` and `local` file data sources. As a result, the time dimension columns are different: the `__time` in the druid type input source and the `timestamp` in the local input source. The result is the incorrect data rollup result.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\n1. Changed the timestamp column name to `__time` in the ingestion specs. for [Updating existing data tutorial](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/tutorial-update-data.html) :\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"timestampSpec\": {\r\n        \"column\": \"__time\",\r\n        \"format\": \"iso\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n2. Renamed timestamp column to `__time` in the  [Updating existing data tutorial](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/tutorial-update-data.html) data files.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

this change, JDBC lookups with reserved keywords present in table, key, or column names will not parse correctly.

Description\r\n\r\nAnother step toward the Druid catalog, this one providing extended functionality to the table functions introduced in an earlier PR.\r\n\r\n* Revises properties, definitions in the catalog\r\n* Adds a \"table function\" abstraction to model such functions\r\n* Specific functions for HTTP, inline, local and S3.\r\n* Extended SQL types in the catalog. Primarily for later use, also used to handle types for external tables.\r\n* Restructure external table definitions to use table functions\r\n* EXTEND syntax for Druid's extern table function\r\n* Support for array-valued table function parameters\r\n* Support for array-valued SQL query parameters\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, MSQ did not support query parameters. This PR starts to provide support. Some of the required functionality will follow in the planner-focused catalog PR.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nSee the `reference.md` documentation page in this PR for the revised functionality. Of note are the new table functions and the array table function parameters. This functionality allows the user to, say, reuse the same SQL for every ingest, only passing in a different set of input files as query parameters on each ingest.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nCalcite's test framework has been revamped recently to reduce the dependence on statically created objects and inject the dependency via Guice. This unlocks the ability to inject MSQ-specific dependencies and test out the existing Calcite's tests using the MSQ engine.\r\n\r\nChanges accomplished in the PR:\r\n1. Inject MSQ's specific objects using Guice so that the code path to run the tests via Guice exists.\r\n2. Refactor the existing test runner\r\n  a. Run steps are now chained together so that one run step can use the results obtained from the previous run step and the final run step's results are used in the verification\r\n  b. The query context is now not taken into account while verifying the queries\r\n  c. Add the support to add custom verifications\r\n3. The MSQ has an extract step that allows the query results to be extracted from the reports before they are verified.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MSQTestBase`\r\n * `CalciteSelectQueryTestMSQ`\r\n * `QueryTestRunner`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

context to HadoopIngestionSpec\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt is possible to pass `context` to ingestion task using task context (https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/tasks.html#context). However, this context is not added to `HadoopIngestionSpec` and is not accessible further downstream in the various `Jobby`. \r\n\r\nHadoop ingestion job can also be submitted via command line (non-task)(https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/hadoop.html#command-line-non-task-version). This method only takes the `HadoopIngestionSpec` (not the `HadoopIndexTask`). This does not let the user pass context into Hadoop ingestion job.\r\n\r\nThe fix in this PR is to add `context` map to HadoopIngestionSpec. The `context` map can be set directly in HadoopIngestionSpec if the user is using command line (non-task) version or set in HadoopIndexTask's `context` map which is then automatically added to HadoopIngestionSpec. \r\n\r\nNote that if context map is set in both HadoopIngestionSpec and HadoopIndexTask, then the context map in HadoopIndexTask will overwrite the one in HadoopIngestionSpec.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR updates the docker image version of druid to 24.0.1 instead of 0.24.0 in the docker-compose file. Since many people use the docker-compose from the main branch. The fellow developers who are experiencing or experimenting with druid are using version 0.24.0 as mentioned earlier and encountered an issue whereby the docker is unable to find the manifest on the stated druid image version. \r\n\r\nRelease Note/Changelogs:\r\n- Add configuration to bind postgres instance on the default port (\"5432\") to docker-compose file\r\n- Update broker, historical, middlemanager and router instance to use druid 24.0.1 on docker-compose file\r\n- Remove trailing space on docker-compose file\r\n\r\nThis PR has been self-reviewed and added a release note entry in the PR

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n-->\r\nAuthenticationResult from KerberosAuthenticator can be used for Authorization (i.e. Ranger)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `AuthenticationResult`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/java-dg-region-selection.html#automatically-determine-the-aws-region-from-the-environment)\r\n\r\n# Why I did it\r\n\r\nI tried to use auto scaler but failed cause I can't call EC2 API of my region(ap-northeast-1). I deployed druid on my private subnet of VPC that cannot go out to internet, so I must use VPC endpoints. But VPC endpoints is not supported another region. I tried to add `-Daws.region=ap-northeast-1` to the jvm.config or set environment variable `AWS_REGION=ap-northeast-1` but both not worked. So I found source code and aws documentation and realized it should use ec2 client builder.\r\n\r\nBelow is the sample log.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-12-22T11:43:04,581 ERROR

Parquet Parser missing column when reading parquet file \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIf you are ingesting Parquet using hadoop task, then you would set Parquet Hadoop Parser (https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/data-formats.html#parquet-hadoop-parser)\r\nLooking at how things work, there is a DruidParquetReadSupport class that select the columns from the parquet schema that are used in the schema of the ingestion job. This is use to read in Parquet data for the map/reduce job.\r\n\r\nDruidParquetReadSupport#getPartialReadSchema only consider the fields in the parseSpec->dimensionsSpec->dimensions, the ts field from parseSpec->timestampSpec->column, and the metrics’ requiredFields from dataSchema->metrics->fieldName\r\nThe issue: you have a transformSpec or a flattenSpec which creates a field that has a different name which does not exist in your parquet schema and you do not include the base field (that exist in parquet schema) in the dimensionsSpec. For example, your parquet file has column country, then you add a  transformSpec  that does something like \"transforms\": [ { \"type\": \"expression\", \"name\": \"countryUpper\", \"expression\": \"upper(country)\" }  . In the parseSpec->dimensionsSpec->dimensions, you only have countryUpper  (as you don’t want the original country field in your Druid datasource). The problem is that the DruidParquetReadSupport will not read in the country field (as country is not in the dimensionsSpec). As a result, you will not get  countryUpper  in your Druid datasource as Druid (map/reduce) job did not read in the country field.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the above issue by determining the columns that the reader needs to read from parquet file by also looking at the flattenSpec and transformSpec.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-22T04:52:32Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:05:26Z","closed_at":"2023-01-12T06:08:49Z","merged_at":"2023-01-12T06:08:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"7f54ebbf478b9a2122edcc4bee4815ae86831927","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue which can occur when the broker tries to emit metrics for parallel merge on an empty result set over jdbc. There might be other ways to trigger this as well, but this was the most reliable one.\r\n\r\nThe issue happens with an empty result set because it causes the `Yielders.each` call to close the sequence on the main thread instead of the query executor thread, which owns the metrics.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to create the yielder on the query executor thread as well, so that if the sequence is consumed, any baggages that might be emitting metrics, such as broker parallel merge metrics, will not be called in the wrong thread.\r\n\r\nrelevant stacktrace snippet:\r\n```\r\n2022-12-22T00:06:56,479 ERROR [qtp614516107-165] org.apache.druid.sql.avatica.DruidMeta - DefaultQueryMetrics must not be modified from multiple threads.

had 2 different classes both creating fake\r\ninstances of an HttpServletRequest, this makes\r\nit to that we only have one in a common location\r\n\r\nThe change removes DummyRequest in favor of MockHttpServletRequest, this is primarily for 2 reasons\r\n\r\n1. Convenience as MockHttpServletRequest was already in `server` (but this is kinda a non-reason)\r\n2. `DummyRequest` was implemented in a way such that non-implemented methods were all returning default values (like `return null` or `return 0`).  It's been my experience that when you start using a new method in a class and the mock instance that you are using just returns a dummy value, it's pretty easy to believe that you did something wrong in your code and go down weird paths debugging when it's just that the mock hasn't yet implemented the methods you were working with.  `MockHttpServletRequest` does a `throw new UnsupportedOperationException()` on any method that hasn't been implemented, which fails quickly, shows you where the unexpected call came from and indicates that you are essentially just using functionality that hasn't been implemented on the mock yet, so the recourse is to implement it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

the Operator interface introduced for Window functions to be more of a push-model. The impetus for this is to generate better stack traces. With the pull-based model, the stack trace of an exception shows the operator chain that still has work to do without any indication of which operators have done work so far.\r\n\r\nWith the change in the API introduced here, we will produce stack traces that start with the full operator chain running down the .go() method. Then the stack will walk back up towards the Receiver that was passed into the .go() method. This should produce a stack trace that tells us both the full operator chain that is being executed as well as give an indication of what actions have happened so far as the data has been processed.\r\n\r\nIt remains important that Operators are implemented directly without any usage of fluent-style programming. This is something that we will likely have to enforce through review.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a refactoring with no additional functionality.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

the Operator interface introduced for Window functions to be more of a push-model.  The impetus for this is to generate better stack traces.  With the pull-based model, the stack trace of an exception shows the operator chain that still has work to do without any indication of which operators have done work so far.\r\n\r\nWith the change in the API introduced here, we will produce stack traces that start with the full operator chain running down the `.go()` method.  Then the stack will walk back up towards the `Receiver` that was passed into the `.go()` method.  This should produce a stack trace that tells us both the full operator chain that is being executed as well as give an indication of what actions have happened so far as the data has been processed.\r\n\r\nIt remains important that Operators are implemented directly without any usage of fluent-style programming.  This is something that we will likely have to enforce through review.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a refactoring with no additional functionality.\r\n\r\nIt's based on this HTTP refactoring, so cannot be merged until that is merged: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13564\r\n\r\nIt probably also shouldn't be reviewed until that is merged as this will contain all of the diffs for that PR too.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

goal here is to develop rules to add `LogicalCorrelate` and `Uncollect` to support the query form we have decided for SQL Unnest.\r\n\r\nThe SQL query that takes the form `SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY['1','2','3'])` or `SELECT * FROM druid.numfoo, UNNEST(MV_TO_ARRAY(dim3))` generates two components in the Calcite's logical plan (`LogicalCorrelate` and `Uncollect`) which do not have DruidConverters. \r\n\r\nThe logical plans that calcite generates for these type of queries are \r\n```\r\n SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY['1','2','3'])\r\n \r\n Generates the plan\r\n\r\n25:Uncollect\r\n  23:LogicalProject(subset=[rel#24:Subset#1.NONE.[]], EXPR$0=[ARRAY('1', '2', '3')])\r\n    4:LogicalValues(subset=[rel#22:Subset#0.NONE.[0]], tuples=[[{ 0 }]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM druid.numfoo, UNNEST(MV_TO_ARRAY(dim3))\r\n\r\nGenerates\r\n\r\n80:LogicalCorrelate(correlation=[$cor0], joinType=[inner], requiredColumns=[{3}])\r\n  6:LogicalTableScan(subset=[rel#74:Subset#0.NONE.[]], table=[[druid, numfoo]])\r\n  78:Uncollect(subset=[rel#79:Subset#3.NONE.[]])\r\n    76:LogicalProject(subset=[rel#77:Subset#2.NONE.[]], EXPR$0=[MV_TO_ARRAY($cor0.dim3)])\r\n      7:LogicalValues(subset=[rel#75:Subset#1.NONE.[0]], tuples=[[{ 0 }]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we add a set of rules which helps convert these to Druid queries. In a nutshell the chain of rules look like the following:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-15 at 4 25 36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93540295/207994370-f7d6be7a-7c28-4d1f-8799-c7d5020f738c.png)\r\n\r\nIn this PR we define the rules and develop appropriate DruidRels with partial queries that converts these plans to druid queries.

Description\r\nThis PR expands `StringDimensionIndexer` to handle conversion of `byte[]` to base64 encoded strings, rather than the current behavior of calling java `toString`. \r\n\r\nThis issue was uncovered by a regression of sorts introduced by #13519, which updated the protobuf extension to directly convert stuff to java types, resulting in `bytes` typed values being converted as `byte[]` instead of a base64 string which the previous JSON based conversion created. While outputting `byte[]` is more consistent with other input formats, and preferable when the bytes can be consumed directly (such as complex types serde), when fed to a `StringDimensionIndexer`, it resulted in an ugly java `toString` because `processRowValsToUnsortedEncodedKeyComponent` is fed the output of `row.getRaw(..)`. Converting `byte[]` to a base64 string within `StringDimensionIndexer` is consistent with the behavior of calling `row.getDimension(..)` which does do this coercion (and why many tests on binary types appeared to be doing the expected thing).\r\n\r\nI added some protobuf `bytes` tests, but they don't really hit the new `StringDimensionIndexer` behavior because they operate on the `InputRow` directly, and call `getDimension` to validate stuff. The parser based version still uses the old conversion mechanisms, so when not using a flattener incorrectly calls `toString` on the `ByteString`. I have encoded this behavior in the test for now, if we either update the parser to use the new flattener or just .. remove parsers we can remove this test stuff.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR updates the nested column storage format to store nested fields in files named by their position in the fields list, rather than using a stringified 'jq' syntax version of the path itself. This fixes an issue caused by processing nested data which contains newlines or commas in the path itself, which breaks the `meta.smoosh` csv file which stores the offsets of all \"files\" contained within a smoosh. This bumps the format version to 4, a \"v3\" version of the column has been left in place to read segments that have already been written.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes in this patch, the `meta.smoosh` looks something like this for a nested column\r\n```\r\n...\r\nagent,0,12702347,12702715\r\nagent.__doubleDictionary,0,12709430,12709436\r\nagent.__field_0,0,16298575,16814042\r\nagent.__field_1,0,16814042,17816369\r\nagent.__field_2,0,17816369,18124530\r\nagent.__field_3,0,18124530,18804682\r\nagent.__field_4,0,18804682,19361484\r\nagent.__field_5,0,19361484,19635903\r\nagent.__longDictionary,0,12709424,12709430\r\nagent.__raw,0,16298570,16298575\r\nagent.__raw_compressed,0,14674079,16298570\r\nagent.__raw_offsets,0,12709436,14674079\r\nagent.__stringDictionary,0,12702715,12709424\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no user facing aspect of this change, other than not writing out broken segments whenever the comma or newline are present in any of the paths.\r\n\r\nI have also updated `StructuredDataProcessor` to no longer directly create a stringified form of the field path, instead using `NestedPathPart` to be consistent with all of the other places that abstractly handle nested data stuffs. While I was here I've also sorted the output of `JSON_PATHS` so that it produces a stable result, making testing a bit easier.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the best way to write tests to ensure that we can still read the 'v3' format, I suppose I could construct one by hand to make sure the reader can still find nested files, but .. haven't done this yet.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

SqlResource and QueryResource have been\r\nusing independent logic for things like error\r\nhandling and response context stuff.

Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a bug with nested column \"value set\" indexes caused by not properly validating that the globalId looked up for value is present in the global dictionary prior to looking it up in the local dictionary, which when \"adjusting\" the global ids for value type can cause incorrect selection of value indexes.\r\n\r\nTo use an example of a variant typed nested column with 3 values `[\"1\", null, -2]` (the test case I added). The string dictionary is `[null, \"1\"]` and the long dictionary is `[-2]` and our local dictionary is `[0, 1, 2]`.\r\n\r\nThe code for variant typed indexes checks if the value is present in all global dictionaries and returns indexes for all matches. So in this case, we first lookup \"1\" in the string dictionary, find it at global id 1, all is good. Now, we check the long dictionary for `1`, which due to `-(insertionpoint + 1)` gives us `-(1 + 2) = -2`. Since the global id space is actually stacked dictionaries, global ids for long and double values must be \"adjusted\" by the size of string dictionary, and size of string + size of long for doubles.\r\n\r\nBack to indexOf for longs and doubles. Since prior to this patch we were not checking that the globalId is 0 or larger, we then immediately looked up the `localDictionary.indexOf(-2 + adjustLong) = localDictionary.indexOf(-2 + 2) = localDictionary.indexOf(0)` ... which is an actual value contained in the dictionary! We should have skipped the longs completely since there were no global matches, but instead we randomly picked the 'null' value index since it is 0.\r\n\r\nOn to doubles, `-(insertionPoint + 1)` gives us `-(0 + 1) = -1`. The double adjust value is '3' since 2 strings and 1 long, so `localDictionary.indexOf(-1 + 3)` = `localDictionary.indexOf(2)` which is also a real value in our local dictionary that is definitely not '1'.\r\n\r\nSo in this one case, looking for '1' actually ended up matching every row, fun! Anyway, my bad, nested column indexes are pretty complicated 😅 \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added

This PR adds the capability to track the bytes processed by an MSQ controller task while reading from an external input source.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Create an instance of `InputStats` for every `InputSource` in `ExternalInputSliceReader`\r\n- Track `processedBytes` in `InputStats` by invoking `InputSourceReader.read(inputStats)`\r\n- Update `ChannelCounters` with the above obtained `processedBytes` when incrementing the input file count.\r\n- Add expected counters in `MSQTester` to be verified in tests\r\n- Update task report structure in docs\r\n\r\n### Total input processed bytes\r\nThe total input processed bytes can be obtained by summing the `processedBytes` as follows:\r\n```\r\ntotalBytes = 0\r\nfor every root stage (i.e. a stage which does not have another stage as an input):\r\n    for every worker in that stage:\r\n        for every input channel: (i.e. channels with prefix \"input\", e.g. \"input0\", \"input1\", etc.)\r\n            totalBytes += processedBytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nTrack bytes read from an input source in the stage counters of an MSQ task report.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n`processedBytes` with sample \"wikipedia\" datasource:\r\n\r\n- MSQ batch:\r\n<img width=\"295\" alt=\"msq_bytes\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18635897/207430326-3cc44205-df41-4c49-984b-f57acf5179fe.png\">\r\n\r\n- Classic batch:\r\n<img width=\"369\" alt=\"batch_bytes\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18635897/207430937-47608d23-739b-4820-8a5a-7c7bdbd66fb9.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nHttpRemoteTaskRunner#shutdown doesn't execute the shutdown hooks and this led to discrepancies such as `task/run/time` not being emitted by cancelled tasks or those shutdown by the supervisor.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #13543.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nUse a smaller default buffer in the TextReader during parsing. By default, the [LineIterator creates a BufferedReader if one is not provided](https://github.com/apache/commons-io/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/io/LineIterator.java#L84-L88); the default [BufferedReader creates an 8KB buffer](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u/blob/9a751dc19fae78ce58fb0eb176522070c992fb6f/jdk/src/share/classes/java/io/BufferedReader.java#L88).\r\n\r\nImprove this by creating a `FastLineIterator` which minimises the repeated creation of buffers.\r\n\r\nBefore vs after\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                         Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nJsonLineReaderBenchmark.baseline  avgt   15  3459.871 ± 106.175  us/op      [before]\r\nJsonLineReaderBenchmark.baseline  avgt   15  3022.053 ± 51.286  us/op       [after]\r\n```\r\nExisting tests cover the change (JsonLineReader, CSVReader).

we use Guava 16.0.1. This is a very old version, but we continue to use it in order to maintain compatibility with Hadoop 2, which also bundles a very old version of Guava. As a community we have not yet made the decision to drop support for Hadoop 2 (https://lists.apache.org/thread/1j5w9dmt1gp8hx31tvrmyomcko4mlp03), but nevertheless, we'd like to update Calcite (https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/13532). Current versions of Calcite support a minimum of Guava 19.0, so this patch updates us to that version.

planner sets sqlInsertSegmentGranularity in its context when using PARTITIONED BY, which sets it on every native query in the stack (as all native queries for a SQL query typically have the same context). QueryKit would interpret that as a request to configure bucketing for all native queries. This isn't useful, as bucketing is only used for the penultimate stage in INSERT / REPLACE.\r\n\r\nSo, this patch modifies QueryKit to only look at sqlInsertSegmentGranularity on the outermost query.\r\n\r\nAs an additional change, this patch switches the static ObjectMapper to use the processwide ObjectMapper for deserializing Granularities. Saves an ObjectMapper instance, and ensures that if there are any special serdes registered for Granularity, we'll pick them up.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

current defaults can cause issues for people because they do not take into account the generally large difference in size between aggregated and nonaggregated records, and they do not take into account the amount of available memory. This patch improves the defaults such that they do take these things into account and would be appropriate in a wider variety of situations.\r\n\r\n1) Default recordsPerFetch and recordBufferSize based on available memory\r\n   rather than using hardcoded numbers. For this, we need an estimate\r\n   of record size. Use 10 KB for regular records and 1 MB for aggregated\r\n   records. With 1 GB heaps, 2 processors per task, and nonaggregated\r\n   records, recordBufferSize comes out to the same as the old\r\n   default (10000), and recordsPerFetch comes out slightly lower (1250\r\n   instead of 4000).\r\n\r\n2) Default maxRecordsPerPoll based on whether records are aggregated\r\n   or not (100 if not aggregated, 1 if aggregated). Prior default was 100.\r\n\r\n3) Default fetchThreads based on processors divided by task count on\r\n   Indexers, rather than overall processor count.\r\n\r\n4) Additionally clean up the serialized JSON a bit by adding various\r\n   JsonInclude annotations.","created_at":"2022-12-09T09:43:44Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:05:17Z","closed_at":"2023-01-13T05:33:54Z","merged_at":"2023-01-13T05:33:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"182c4fad299fca4864010fa7a07aa30c1f4dd9c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3736834095,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAGEErM7eu5Av","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/AWS%20Kinesis","name":"AWS

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

planner sets sqlInsertSegmentGranularity in its context when using PARTITIONED BY, which sets it on every native query in the stack (as all native queries for a SQL query typically have the same context). QueryKit would interpret that as a request to configure bucketing for all native queries. This isn't useful, as bucketing is only used for the penultimate stage in INSERT / REPLACE.\r\n\r\nSo, this patch modifies QueryKit to only look at sqlInsertSegmentGranularity on the outermost query.\r\n\r\nAs an additional change, this patch switches the static ObjectMapper to use the processwide ObjectMapper for deserializing Granularities. Saves an ObjectMapper instance, and ensures that if there are any special serdes registered for Granularity, we'll pick them
