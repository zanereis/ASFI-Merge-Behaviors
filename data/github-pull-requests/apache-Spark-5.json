MySQL connector generates SQL which fails with cast.\r\nThese are the steps to reproduce.\r\n1. CREATE TABLE test_cast(string_col STRING, long_col LONG, binary_col BINARY, double_col DOUBLE);\r\n2. INSERT INTO test_cast VALUES('0', 0, x'30', 0.0);\r\n3. SELECT * FROM test_cast WHERE CAST(string_col AS BINARY) = binary_col;\r\n4. SELECT * FROM test_cast WHERE CAST(string_col AS LONG) = long_col;\r\n5. SELECT * FROM test_cast WHERE CAST(long_col AS STRING) = '0';\r\n6.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDirectly calling `contains` on a `SparkException.getCondition` may result in a NullPointerException if `getCondition` returns `null`. This change wraps `getCondition` in an option for safe handling.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThrowing an NPE is a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Previously, on SparkException such as OOM that do not have a set condition, users would see an NullPointerException. Now they will correctly see a CANNOT_LOAD_STATE_STORE exception.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2025-01-11T00:56:40Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T00:27:11Z","closed_at":"2025-01-14T00:26:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e9e327ee9c2861aff6552db815ecba9ebc11db9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplement the parseJson functionality in PySpark, for parsing a json string to a VariantVal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way to create a VariantVal from python. It can only be created from Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAdded `VariantVal.parseJson`, which takes a json string, and returns a `VariantVal`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unittests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nno","created_at":"2025-01-11T00:05:22Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T03:58:47Z","closed_at":"2025-01-14T03:58:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f25dee0a463efa52a093cf7519dd4d8f33101e58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b1af0e06cedc24e9910b2fef5cb6dc56bc7a389","head":{"label":"gene-db:py-parse-json","ref":"py-parse-json","sha":"7b1af0e06cedc24e9910b2fef5cb6dc56bc7a389","user":{"login":"gene-db","id":77996944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTk2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77996944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db","html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":654336314,"node_id":"R_kgDOJwBhOg","name":"spark","full_name":"gene-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gene-db","id":77996944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTk2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77996944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db","html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db/spark","description":"Apache

A corresponding function is also added to create large-row dataframes during the benchmark running time. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nLarge-row dataframes, especially dataframes with large string cells are becoming common with business like online customer chatting. However, it is unknown how well/bad Spark would be able to support them. \r\n\r\nThis benchmark aims to provide a baseline to indicate Spark's performance and limitation on large-row dataframes. It will also be included in future performance regression check. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nIt is tested in Github Action and manual reviewed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request introduces support for local variables in SQL scripting.\r\n\r\n#### Behavior:\r\n\r\nLocal variables are declared in the headers of compound bodies, and are bound to it's scope. Variables of the same name are allowed in nested scopes, where the innermost variable will be resolved. Optionally, a local variable can be qualified with the label of the compound body in which it was declared, which would allow accessing variables which are not the innermost in the current scope.\r\n\r\nLocal variables have resolution priority over session variables, session variable resolution is attempted after local variable resolution. The exception to this is with fully qualified session variables, in the format `system.session.<varName>` or `session.<varName>`. System and session are forbidden for use as compound body labels.\r\n\r\nLocal variables must not be qualified on declaration, can be set using `SET VAR` and cannot be `DROPPED`.\r\n\r\nThey also should not be allowed to be declared with `DECLARE OR REPLACE`, however this is not implemented on this PR as `FOR` statement relies on this behavior. `FOR` statement must be updated in a separate PR to use proper local variables, as the current implementation is simulating them using session variables.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation notes:\r\n\r\nAs core depends on catalyst, it's impossible to import code from core(where most of SQL scripting implementation is located) to catalyst. To solve this a trait `VariableManager` is introduced, which is then implemented in core and injected to catalyst. This `VariableManager` is basically a wrapper around `SqlScriptingExecutionContext` and provides methods for getting/setting/creating variables.\r\n\r\nThis injection is tricky because we want to have one `ScriptingVariableManager` **per script**.\r\nOptions considered to achieve this are:\r\n- Pass the manager/context to the analyzer using function calls. If possible, this solution would be ideal because it would allow every run of the analyzer to have it's own scripting context which is automatically cleaned up (AnalysisContext). This would also allow more control over the variable resolution, i.e. for `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` we could simply not pass in the script context and it would behave as if outside of a script. This is the intended behavior for `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`. The problem with this approach is it seems hard to implement. The call stack would be as follows: `Analyzer.executeAndCheck` -> `HybridAnalyzer.apply` -> `RuleExecutor.executeAndTrack` -> `Analyzer.execute` (**overridden** from RuleExecutor) -> `Analyzer.withNewAnalysisContext`. Implementing this context propagation would require changing the signatures of all of these methods, including superclass methods like `execute` and `executeAndTrack`.\r\n- Store the context in `CatalogManager`. `CatalogManager's` lifetime is tied to the session, so to allow for multiple scripts to execute in the same time we would need to e.g. have a map `scriptUUID -> VariableManager`, and to have the `scriptUUID` as a `ThreadLocal` variable in the `CatalogManager`. The drawback of this approach is that the script has to clean up it's resources after execution, and also that it's more complicated to e.g. forbid `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` from accessing local variables.\r\n\r\nCurrently the second option seems better to me, however I am open to suggestions on how to approach this.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, local variables are simulated using session variables in SQL scripting, which is a temporary solution and bad in many ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this change introduces multiple new types of errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests were added to SqlScriptingExecutionSuite and SqlScriptingParserSuite.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Remove the assert of single parameterized query because it restricts parameterization of `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`. The assert checks that only single node of the type `ParameterizedQuery` presents in a query, but `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` adds one `ParameterizedQuery` + `sql()` adds another `ParameterizedQuery`. So, this case is prohibited by the assert though it is a valid use case from user's perspective.\r\n2. Modify parameters binding: stop the bind procedure when face to another parameterized query. For example, the sql text passed to `spark.sql()` contains `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`, and `sql()` parameters don't affect on the sql query string in `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`.\r\n3. Allow parameters in `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` variables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore the changes, the following query fails with the internal error:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"execute immediate 'select ?' using 1\", Map(\"param1\" -> \"1\"))\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: [INTERNAL_ERROR] The Spark SQL phase analysis failed with an internal error. You hit a bug in Spark or the Spark plugins you use. Please, report this bug to the corresponding communities or vendors, and provide the full stack trace. SQLSTATE: XX000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the query above returns proper results instead of the internal error:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"execute immediate 'select ?' using 1\", Map(\"param1\" -> \"1\"))\r\nval res2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [1: int]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.ParametersSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-10T14:35:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T07:27:49Z","closed_at":"2025-01-14T17:14:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9b4c901d39d56797ad96591b4d4cba298fecea9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/89beeda421d546462a802ce5eaa6be246c44a671","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-params-execute-immediate","ref":"fix-params-execute-immediate","sha":"89beeda421d546462a802ce5eaa6be246c44a671","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAccording to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44021#issuecomment-1863873954, we can integrate the profiling results with Spark UI (both live and history) in the future, so it's good to follow the event logs file name pattern and layout as much as possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, it's an unreleased feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49018, the restoration logic for feature flags was fixed using the `setFeatureMask` method. However, the `setFeatureMask` method has been deprecated since Jackson 2.7, so this pr reimplements the relevant logic using `overrideStdFeatures`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up the use of deprecated APIs.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/0d2b0f39200d466f49f1abb06d9027053d41483d/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser.java#L999-L1035\r\n\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     *

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen converting from `toJsonLinkedHashMap` result to `DESCRIBE TABLE`, `removeWhitespace` helper is unnecessary. This PR removes the helper util to ensure equivalent behavior of `DESCRIBE TABLE` output.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnsure backwards compatibility for `DESCRIBE TABLE`, after introduction of `DESCRIBE TABLE AS JSON`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it maintains the original output of `DESCRIBE TABLE`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

is still in development phase, and so it should be disabled by default until it is completed, other than in unit tests that validate the functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nJust explicitly throwing a query compilation error that object level collations are unsupported feature, in case the newly added feature flag is disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDedicated unit tests are added to verify that when the feature flag is disabled, attempting to set object level collation (on table or view object) results in query compilation error that the feature is not supported. The existing unit tests already added as part of previous PR linked above validate that when the feature flag is enabled, the object level collation could be properly set (flag is enabled by default in testing environment)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-10T00:10:56Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T05:20:12Z","closed_at":"2025-01-10T05:19:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fc9a48d4297b1429064e06b6c8b5d0469379eb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5a0432c4338f274d62a2ab92e22e13b07ab7d708","head":{"label":"dejankrak-db:conf-flag-object-level-collations","ref":"conf-flag-object-level-collations","sha":"5a0432c4338f274d62a2ab92e22e13b07ab7d708","user":{"login":"dejankrak-db","id":184246885,"node_id":"U_kgDOCvtiZQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184246885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dejankrak-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":874894316,"node_id":"R_kgDONCXT7A","name":"spark","full_name":"dejankrak-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dejankrak-db","id":184246885,"node_id":"U_kgDOCvtiZQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184246885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db","html_url":"https://github.com/dejankrak-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dejankrak-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dejankrak-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ExecutorKubernetesCredentialsFeatureStepSuite` tests that Spark sets the correct service account on executor pods for various configuration combinations. This patch corrects some invalid test assertions and refactors to reduce redundancy across the different test cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`ExecutorKubernetesCredentialsFeatureStepSuite` attempts to check that the Spark code sets the correct service account on the executor pod. However, the current assertions are actually no-ops that check if a variable is equal to itself, which is always true. The test would pass even if the product code had a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a change in tests only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Intentionally introduce a bug in `ExecutorKubernetesCredentialsFeatureStep` by hard-coding a bogus service account (not included in this pull request).\r\n1. `build/mvn -o -Pkubernetes -Pscala-2.12 -pl resource-managers/kubernetes/core -Dsuites='org.apache.spark.deploy.k8s.features.ExecutorKubernetesCredentialsFeatureStepSuite' test`\r\n1. The test succeeds, even though there is a bug.\r\n1. Apply this patch.\r\n1. Rerun the test, and it fails, as it should.\r\n1. Revert the bug, rerun the test, and it succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-09T21:35:57Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T17:19:57Z","closed_at":"2025-01-10T15:09:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d7302f9d8049e06a2221a6e5034474e4e27bf10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49428/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49428/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49428/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5934195f108bd99caf81d9fb0bc2d8a15774b171","head":{"label":"cnauroth:SPARK-50776","ref":"SPARK-50776","sha":"5934195f108bd99caf81d9fb0bc2d8a15774b171","user":{"login":"cnauroth","id":227407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzQwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/227407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth","html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":617152902,"node_id":"R_kgDOJMkBhg","name":"spark","full_name":"cnauroth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cnauroth","id":227407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzQwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/227407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth","html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request introduces the logic of error handling inside SQL Scripting language. Now, it is possible to:\r\n- declare conditions for specific SQL States (currently only valid in scope where they are defined)\r\n- declare handlers to catch and process errors that are risen during statement execution\r\n\r\nRules for selecting the most appropriate handler:\r\n- Named condition handlers are most specific.\r\n- SQLSTATE handlers are next in specificity.\r\n- Generic NOT FOUND and SQLEXCEPTION handlers are least specific.\r\n\r\nNote: Handlers defined in the innermost compound statement where the exception was raised are considered.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe intent is to add the possibility for user to handle SQL errors in a custom defined way.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\n- Currently, only `EXIT` handler is supported. Support for `CONTINUE` handlers will come in the future.\r\n- It is only possible to declare condition in its full form by specifying SQLSTATE. Short form with default SQLSTATE is not yet supported.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere are already existing test suites for SQL scripting that have been improved to test new functionalities:\r\n\r\n- `SqlScriptingParserSuite`\r\n- `SqlScriptingExecutionSuite`\r\n- `SqlScriptingE2eSuite`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-09T18:43:04Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T09:30:29Z","closed_at":"2025-02-04T04:52:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"230ab3274d7f24b110a6608cb3d7127b16ea5926","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0481234c50fce2ce143850668254af59e1dc7962","head":{"label":"miland-db:milan-dankovic_data/refactor-execution-4-condition-handlers","ref":"milan-dankovic_data/refactor-execution-4-condition-handlers","sha":"0481234c50fce2ce143850668254af59e1dc7962","user":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768539955,"node_id":"R_kgDOLc79Mw","name":"spark","full_name":"miland-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db/spark","description":"Apache

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this pr, for spark on k8s, the krb5.conf config map will be mounted in executor side as well.\r\nBefore, the krb5.conf config map is only mounted in driver side. But according to the parameter description, the krb5.conf file should be mounted on both the driver and the executor.\r\n```\r\n  val KUBERNETES_KERBEROS_KRB5_FILE =\r\n    ConfigBuilder(\"spark.kubernetes.kerberos.krb5.path\")\r\n      .doc(\"Specify the local location of the krb5.conf file to be mounted on the driver \" +\r\n        \"and executors for Kerberos. Note: The KDC defined needs to be \" +\r\n        \"visible from inside the containers \")\r\n      .version(\"3.0.0\")\r\n      .stringConf\r\n      .createOptional\r\n\r\n  val KUBERNETES_KERBEROS_KRB5_CONFIG_MAP =\r\n    ConfigBuilder(\"spark.kubernetes.kerberos.krb5.configMapName\")\r\n      .doc(\"Specify the name of the ConfigMap, containing the krb5.conf file, to be mounted \" +\r\n        \"on the driver and executors for Kerberos. Note: The KDC defined\" +\r\n        \"needs to be visible from inside the containers \")\r\n      .version(\"3.0.0\")\r\n      .stringConf\r\n      .createOptional\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter [SPARK-43504](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43504), the hadoop config map will be mounted on the executor pod.\r\nNow the executor pod fails to start because the hadoop conf file contains Kerberos authentication configuration, but the executor does not mount krb5.conf correctly.\r\nSee the  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41181 discuss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users do not need to take workarounds to make executors load the krb5.conf.\r\nSuch as: \r\n- including krb5.conf in executor image\r\n- placing krb5.conf in executor working directory using --files\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT.\r\nAuthored-by: lifumao

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMade a new class to put most commonly used collation names and refactor `CollationSupportSuite` which had  thousands of literals for the four most used collations (UTF8_BINARY, UTF8_LCASE, UNICODE and UNICODE_CI)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be able to have this centralized and not have to create new string literals with \"UTF8_BINARY\" over and over again.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nShould be covered with existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport DataFrame conversion to table argument in Spark Connect Python Client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUser-Defined Table Functions (UDTFs) are widely used in Spark workflows, which often require a table argument. While Spark SQL supports constructs like TABLE() for this purpose, there is no direct API in PySpark convert a DataFrame into a table argument. So we propose to support DataFrame conversion to table arguments, and enable UDTFs to accept table arguments.\r\n\r\nPySpark Classic already has this implemented. The PR proposes to implement this in Spark Connect Python Client.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes DataFrame conversion to table argument is supported in Spark Connect Python Client, and UDTFs accept table arguments as shown below.\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark\r\n<pyspark.sql.connect.session.SparkSession object at 0x13dcf0eb0>\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR restores the default Spark logging format to plain text instead of JSON.\r\nAfter changes, compared to Spark 3.x releases,  uses can optionally enable structured logging by setting configuration `spark.log.structuredLogging.enabled` to `true` (default is `false`). For additional customization, users can copy `log4j2-json-layout.properties.template` to `conf/log4j2.properties` and adjust as needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter discussions on the [dev mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread/4fnlnvhsqym72k53jw8cjhcdjbhpmm95), Spark developers decided to revert to the previous plain text logging format for two main reasons:\r\n* Readability: JSON logs are verbose and not easily human-readable. \r\n* Setup Requirements: Structured logging requires a logging pipeline to collect JSON logs from both drivers and executors. Enabling it by default doesn’t provide much benefit without this infrastructure in place.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, Spark 4.0 has not yet been released.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests. Also, manually tested on enable/disable the configuration `spark.log.structuredLogging.enabled`, as well as verified the logging behavior with different log4j2 templates.\r\n### Was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPer initial feedback from testing, users would like table aliases (such as those mapping to left and right side inputs to a prior join) to remain available after SET, DROP, and EXTEND operators. Here is an example that should work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalues (0), (1) lhs(a)\r\n|> inner join values (1), (2) rhs(a) using (a)\r\n|> extend lhs.a + rhs.a as z1\r\n|> extend lhs.a - rhs.a as z2\r\n|> drop z1\r\n|> where z2 = 0\r\n|> order by lhs.a, rhs.a, z2\r\n|> set z2 = 4\r\n|> limit 2\r\n|> select lhs.a, rhs.a, z2;\r\n\r\n1    1    4\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo implement this:\r\n* Previously, the `|> where` or `|> order by` operators added a `SubqueryAlias` with an auto-generated table alias to the end of the logical plan under construction, in order to prevent the analyzer from adding attributes to the previous plan later (from `ColumnResolutionHelper.resolveExprsAndAddMissingAttrs`).\r\n* This PR replaces that behavior with a new `PipeOperator` instead, to avoid replacing the table alias while maintaining correct behavior.\r\n* This PR also updates docs to mention the improved table alias behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis makes SQL pipe syntax easier to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the potential stream leak issue by introduing `TaskContext.createResourceUninterruptibly`.\r\n\r\nWhen a task is using `TaskContext.createResourceUninterruptibly` to create the resource, the task would be marked as uninterruptible. Thus, any interruption request during the call to `TaskContext.createResourceUninterruptibly` would be delayed until the creation finishes.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an new lock contention between `Task.kill` and `TaskContext.createResourceUninterruptibly`. But I think it is acceptable given that both are not on the hot-path.\r\n\r\n(I will submmit a followup to apply `TaskContext.createResourceUninterruptibly` in the codebase if this PR is approved by the community.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe had https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48483 tried to fix the potential stream leak issue by task interruption. It mitigates the issue by using\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndef tryInitializeResource[R <: Closeable, T](createResource: => R)(initialize: R => T): T = {\r\n  val resource = createResource\r\n  try {\r\n    initialize(resource)\r\n  } catch {\r\n    case e: Throwable =>\r\n      resource.close()\r\n      throw e\r\n  }\r\n} \r\n```\r\nBut this utility function has an issue that `resource.close()` would leak open resouces if `initialize(resource)` also created some resources internally, especially when `initialize(resource)` is interrupted (See the example of `InterruptionSensitiveInputStream` in the test).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd `toString` for `HiveFileFormat` and `HiveTempPath` to make the display of `InsertIntoHiveTable` plan pretty.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI found the current plan replacing rules does not handle tailing object hash properly https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/36d23eff4b4c3a2b8fd301672e532132c96fdd68/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SQLQueryTestHelper.scala#L62\r\n\r\ninstead of fixing the replacing rule(see #49396, and please let me know if any reviewer think we should fix that too), seems we can override the `toString` of those classes to make it display pretty.\r\n\r\nMinor improvements of plan display for `InsertIntoHiveTable`, and make it consistent with `DataSource` plan like `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`\r\n\r\n`InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`:\r\n```\r\n-- !query\r\ninsert into t6 values (97)\r\n-- !query analysis\r\nInsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand file:[not included in comparison]/{warehouse_dir}/t6, false, Parquet, [path=file:[not included in comparison]/{warehouse_dir}/t6], Append, `spark_catalog`.`default`.`t6`, org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.InMemoryFileIndex(file:[not included in comparison]/{warehouse_dir}/t6), [ascii]\r\n+- Project [cast(col1#x as bigint) AS ascii#xL]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [col1#x]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`InsertIntoHiveTable`:\r\n```patch\r\n -- !query\r\n insert into table spark_test_json_2021_07_16_01 values(1, 'a')\r\n -- !query analysis\r\n-InsertIntoHiveTable `spark_catalog`.`default`.`spark_test_json_2021_07_16_01`, false, false, [c1, c2], org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveFileFormat@xxxxxxxx, org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveTempPath@69beda67\r\n+InsertIntoHiveTable `spark_catalog`.`default`.`spark_test_json_2021_07_16_01`, false, false, [c1, c2], Hive, HiveTempPath(file:[not included in comparison]/{warehouse_dir}/spark_test_json_2021_07_16_01)\r\n +- Project [cast(col1#x as int) AS c1#x, cast(col2#x as string) AS c2#x]\r\n    +- LocalRelation [col1#x, col2#x]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt affects the `EXPLAIN` outputs and Spark UI `SQL/DataFrame` tab plan display\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSee the above examples.\r\n\r\nSpark does not have SQL tests related to the `hive` module, I identified this issue when porting internal test cases to the 4.0. Since all existing SQL tests live on the `sql` module, adding hive-related tests is impossible.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce new configs for tuning Python UDF without Arrow. \r\n\r\nThere are two major configurations for tuning in UDF:\r\n\r\n* batch size on serde of input/output (executor <-> python worker)\r\n* buffer size on writing to channel (executor -> python worker)\r\n\r\nThe first one is hard-coded (100), and the second one is picked from more general config (network buffer), which effectively does not give a proper chance to tune.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables users to tune the above twos, via\r\n\r\n* batch size: `park.sql.execution.python.udf.maxRecordsPerBatch`\r\n* buffer size: `spark.sql.execution.python.udf.buffer.size`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExplained in above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users will be able to tune for Python UDF without Arrow, with new configuration.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-07T08:49:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T22:29:12Z","closed_at":"2025-01-08T08:23:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b9ea197f5d7bb80595571d525f14123411bf280","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2eefc4a474493c869565f90753aabcef47f80992","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-50752","ref":"SPARK-50752","sha":"2eefc4a474493c869565f90753aabcef47f80992","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nImprove masking rule for object hash in sql test results\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe existing rule does not support masking object hash at the tail, e.g. `InsertIntoHiveTable`'s `HiveFileFormat` in the below example.\r\n\r\nNote: The upstream Spark does not have SQL tests related to the `hive` module, I identified this issue when porting internal test cases to the 4.0. Since all existing SQL tests live on the `sql` module, adding hive-related tests is impossible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, only affects test.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GHA, and tested with internal SQL test cases\r\n\r\n```patch\r\n -- !query\r\n insert into table

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd CachedAccessor for PySpark Plotting.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPreviously, `plot` is defined as a property:\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import DataFrame\r\n>>> DataFrame.plot\r\n<property object at 0x10543fd60>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis caused an issue where Sphinx, the documentation generator, could not recognize its chaining methods (e.g., bar, barh, etc.). As a result, it failed to populate the documentation for the available plot methods.\r\n\r\nIt should reach parity with Pandas API on Spark\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> ps.DataFrame.plot\r\n<class 'pyspark.pandas.plot.core.PandasOnSparkPlotAccessor'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo user-facing

[SPARK-49977](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49977) introduced a bug that reversed the output order. This PR fixes the bug in `gatherCommutative()` to restore the original correct ordered output.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Prior to [SPARK-49977](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49977) and after this fix\r\n// commutativeExpressions -> Seq(Literal(1), Literal(2), Literal(3)))\r\n// Post [SPARK-49977](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49977) and before this fix\r\n// commutativeExpressions -> Seq(Literal(3), Literal(2), Literal(1)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds catalog APIs to support the creation and registration of SQL UDFs. It uses Hive Metastore to persist a SQL UDF by deserializing the function information into a FunctionResource and storing it in Hive (toCatalogFunction). During resolution, it retrieves the catalog function and deserializes it into a SQLFunction.\r\n\r\nThis PR only adds the catalog API, and a subsequent PR will add the analyzer logic to resolve SQL UDFs. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo support SQL UDFs in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests. End to end tests will be added in the next PR once we support SQL UDF resolution.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs part of [SPARK-44145](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44145), a callback was added to track completion of analysis and optimization phase of a query. While the analyzed plan is sent when analysis completes successfully it does not when it fail. In that case, we should fallback to the ParsedPlan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe purpose of the analyze event is to track when analysis completes, as such it should also be sent on both success & failure. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-06T20:54:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T04:19:19Z","closed_at":"2025-01-10T04:19:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ab57cc4b67301a837923c90531fe2a93a61987f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a50fd33a889c6236b6f42448402bcc4485e06ac","head":{"label":"jdesjean:jdesjean/SPARK-50600","ref":"jdesjean/SPARK-50600","sha":"7a50fd33a889c6236b6f42448402bcc4485e06ac","user":{"login":"jdesjean","id":7377103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzcxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7377103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean","html_url":"https://github.com/jdesjean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":648429440,"node_id":"R_kgDOJqY_gA","name":"spark","full_name":"jdesjean/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jdesjean","id":7377103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzcxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7377103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean","html_url":"https://github.com/jdesjean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdesjean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jdesjean/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284 to make the CTE inline decision smarter but without introducing overly complex linage tracking. This PR is an alternative fix to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49352 with tracking CTE references a different way.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this PR reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284 and keeps tracking \"contains\" relation in `outgoingRefs`. An example for this relation is \"Case 2\" in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49352 in which `t2` contains `t3`. But while https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284 strores the reference from `t2` -> `t3` in `t2`'s `indirectOutgoingRefSources`, this PR reverts to store the reference in `t2`'s `outgoingRefs` similar to other usual references.\r\n\r\nObviously, the problem with this revert is that queries with duplicate CTE definitions can fail, so let's revisit the problematic query from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284:\r\n```\r\nWithCTE\r\n  CTEDef r0\r\n    ...\r\n  CTEDef r1\r\n    View v\r\n      WithCTE\r\n        CTEDef t1\r\n          OneRowRelation\r\n        CTEDef t2\r\n          CTERef t1\r\n        CTERef t2    // main query of the inner WithCTE\r\n  CTEDef r2\r\n    View v   // exactly the same as the view v above\r\n      WithCTE\r\n        CTEDef t1\r\n          OneRowRelation\r\n        CTEDef t2\r\n          CTERef t1\r\n        CTERef t2\r\n  CTERef r2    // main query of the outer WithCTE\r\n```\r\nThe source of the problem is view `v`, which duplicates a `WithCTE` node and introduces conflicting CTE definitions.\r\nIn the above example, tracking both the `r1` -> `t2` and the `r2` -> `t2` \"contains\" relations in `r1`'s and `r2`'s `outgoingRefs`s cause reference counting problems, as those `t2`s are actually diffrent instances and so they can have different inlining depending on how many times `r1` and `r2` are referenced.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this duplicate issue can only happen when the conflicting `WithCTE` nodes are self-contained (as those nodes can't contain any references to any outer definitions like `r0`). The main advantage of self-contained `WithCTE` nodes is that we need don't need to track `r1` -> `t2` and `r2` -> `t2` references, as the inlining of `t2` (and `t1`) inside the `WithCTE` node don't depend on references coming from outer (`r1`, `r2`) definition. (Please note that what depends on `r1` and `r2` is the inlined result of the whole inner `WithCTE` node.)\r\n\r\nSo to recap: \r\n- we do need to track references from \"contains\" relation when the inner `WithCTE` is not self-contained\r\n- we don't need to (and actually it causes issues if we do) when the inner `WithCTE` is self-contained and the node appears multiple times in the query\r\n- if the inner `WithCTE` is self-contained, but it appears only once in the query, then the both ways are fine\r\n\r\nThis PR suggests the following:\r\n- As during the traversal of `buildCTEMap()` we don't know in advance if a `WithCTE` node is self-contained or not, let's:\r\n  - track the references from \"contains\" relations\r\n  - and also record the container of a definition.\r\n\r\n  E.g. when we encounter `t2` in `r1`, then record `t2` in `r1`'s `outgoingRefs` and record `r1` as the container of `t2`.\r\n\r\n- If we encounter a duplicate definition, then we know it is self-contained so we:\r\n  - don't need to visit it again\r\n  - and we can also remove the reference from its container to the definition.\r\n\r\n  E.g. when we encounter `t2` in `r2`, then clear `t2` from `r1`'s `outgoingRefs` (we know that `r1` was `t2`'s container).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake sure we can inline CTE when we should.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.connection.establish.timeout` setting from `SparkContext` because Apache Spark 4.0.0 uses Apache Hadoop 3.4.1 which has the same default value.\r\n\r\n- #48295\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a logical cleanup by reverting two patches.\r\n\r\n- #45710\r\n- #46874\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. There is no behavior change because we will use the same `fs.s3a.connection.establish.timeout` value.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for `Origin` to the Scala client of Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nThe approach is to send the client `Origin` instance over the wire to the Server, which will reconstruct the instance and attach it to the expression during transformation. By default, only the last element in the stack trace is sent to the server. This is in line with the Python implementation and can be controlled via a Spark config `spark.sql.stackTracesInDataFrameContext`.\r\n\r\nOne Origin message can contain only one of `PythonOrigin` and `JvmOrigin`. The former is filled by the Python client (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46789) and the latter by the Scala client (this PR).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nClose the gap between Classic & Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nYes, to generate protobuf messages.","created_at":"2025-01-06T17:12:38Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T13:05:28Z","closed_at":"2025-01-19T23:58:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f343ec344158ec4fc35b2f74a9c5e96723f47dde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c69480ef6da1a0893b59afc6507b93e5fb6f4952","head":{"label":"xupefei:connect-origin","ref":"connect-origin","sha":"c69480ef6da1a0893b59afc6507b93e5fb6f4952","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request proposes replacing the **noop** operation with **collect** for all _result_ DataFrames on the caller side of the SQL Script execution process.\r\n\r\nThis is the 4th PR in the series of introducing SQL Scripting Execution into Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe proposed change is necessary to maintain a **critical invariant during SQL Script execution**: when `SqlScriptingExecution` returns the next available result statement, it must be executed before proceeding with iteration.\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\nSQL Script execution is based on iterating over interpreted statements and executing them as they are encountered. For certain statement types (_result_ statements), execution is delegated to the caller side (`SparkSession`). To achieve this, the iteration process is divided into two stages:\r\n\r\n- All Compound Execution Nodes (Begin-End block, control flow structures, loops) implement iterator accessible via the `getTreeIterator` method. \r\n- `SqlScriptingExecution` serves as a second-level iterator, iterating over all statements and executing those that **are not** _result_ statements. _Result_ statements are returned to the caller for execution on the caller side. The caller must adhere to the contract of executing the returned statement before continuing iteration.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of this contract between the caller and the `SqlScriptingExecution` API, the implementation of the Java Iterator Interface is not feasible. It is expected from caller to call `getNextResult` until it returns `None` We will enforce correct usage of `SqlScriptingExecution` API through the future PR review process.\r\n\r\nIn this approach we collect every DataFrame to eliminate concerns about which one needs to be returned last. This strategy will also be utilized when we introduce multiple-results API functionality.\r\n\r\n### Impact and Considerations\r\nThis change enhances the robustness of our SQL Script execution process and lays the groundwork for future improvements, including the implementation of a multiple-results API. Reviewers should pay particular attention to the handling of DataFrame collection and the maintenance of execution order integrity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-06T15:23:26Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T01:05:27Z","closed_at":"2025-01-10T01:05:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2518fddb3df7459d9a785c096eb04ec225e665db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49372/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49372/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49372/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dca7fd9738b9e19f5b74871833139faa2ee05d43","head":{"label":"miland-db:milan-dankovic_data/refactor-execution-3-followup","ref":"milan-dankovic_data/refactor-execution-3-followup","sha":"dca7fd9738b9e19f5b74871833139faa2ee05d43","user":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768539955,"node_id":"R_kgDOLc79Mw","name":"spark","full_name":"miland-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe Spark Connect reattach request handler checks whether the associated ExecuteThreadRunner is completed, and returns an error if it has failed to record the outcome.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExecuteResponseObserver.{onError, onComplete} are fallible while they are not retried; this leads to a situation where the ExecuteThreadRunner is completed without succeeding in responding to the client, and thus the client keeps retrying by reattaching the execution.\r\n\r\nTo be specific, if an ExecuteThreadRunner fails to record the completion of execution or an error on the observer and then just disappears, the client will endlessly reattach, hoping that \"someone\" will eventually record \"some data,\" but since the ExecuteThreadRunner is gone, this becomes a deadlock situation.\r\n\r\nThe fix is that when the client attaches, the handler checks the status of the ExecuteThreadRunner, and if it finds that the execution cannot make any progress, an error is returned.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\ntestOnly org.apache.spark.sql.connect.service.SparkConnectServiceE2ESuite\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs a part of Apache Spark 4.0.0 preparation, this PR aims to use the latest K8s v1.32.0 (2024-12-11) for K8s integration tests instead of v1.31.0 (August 13, 2024).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nK8s v1.32 was released on last December.\r\n- https://kubernetes.io/releases/#release-v1-32\r\n\r\nPreviously, we has been depending on the default version of Minikube because Minikube has a rapid release cycle.\r\n\r\nHowever, the release cycle of Minikube is a little slow in these days. We had better control the test target K8s version explicitly for now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a infra-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and check the K8s CI log. The following is the current log of this PR.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Kubelet Version:            v1.32.0\r\n  Kube-Proxy Version:         v1.32.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-06T04:41:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T05:39:04Z","closed_at":"2025-01-06T05:38:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"605b59d9b20d9eebe9ac12cb1d42aae59aba9ed8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49364/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49364/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49364/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2c237058129c8db8b037515d0a18b2f23403e8c1","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:k8s_1.32","ref":"k8s_1.32","sha":"2c237058129c8db8b037515d0a18b2f23403e8c1","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `DebugFilesystem` from `TPCDS(Collation)?QueryTestSuite` while keeping it in all other places.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`TPCDS(Collation)?QueryTestSuite` extends `TPCDSBase` and `TPCHBase` respectively and they are based on `TPCBase` which extends `SharedSparkSession`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/91f3fdd25852b43095dd5273358fc394ffd11b66/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/TPCBase.scala#L24\r\n\r\nAnd, `SharedSparkSession` always uses `DebugFilesystem`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/91f3fdd25852b43095dd5273358fc394ffd11b66/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/test/SharedSparkSession.scala#L68\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove this resetting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a test-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-05T21:28:54Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T03:34:03Z","closed_at":"2025-01-06T03:33:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a5911cf33a40b5f18b525726e6b84dc7445e9b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49359/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49359/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49359/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50daebe64f47bc3af7f3eed41b3a724afb6941d6","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-50729","ref":"SPARK-50729","sha":"50daebe64f47bc3af7f3eed41b3a724afb6941d6","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache
