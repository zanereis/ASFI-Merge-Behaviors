SUMMARY\r\nstep to reproduce/verify:\r\n\r\n1. create a static filter_box with a list of dashboard slugs, and make it has a column named `my_dash_list`. Added it to a dashboard:\r\n```\r\nselect * from (VALUES ('meta'), ('plus-cx'), ('dashboard-data')) x(my_dash);\r\n```\r\n2. create a virtual dataset that uses filter_values template. For example (using Presto SQL):\r\n```\r\nSELECT id, dashboard_title, slug\r\nFROM superset_production_dashboards_v01\r\nwhere slug in ( array_join( Array {{ filter_values('my_dash_list', 'births') }}, ',') )\r\n```\r\n3. Create a chart and add it to above dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Before\r\nBecause `my_dash` column is not a column in the dataset, the chart is showing `incompatible` indicator.\r\n<img width=\"1274\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n- The aim of this PR was to add **Incompatible** section to filter indicator. ‚ö†Incompatible filters are created using datasets & fields which are incompatible with a given chart.\r\n- I have also added simple mocks for native filters: _mockStore_ and _mockNativeFilters_ to test displaying filter

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBetter and faster search for the dataset pane in Explore.\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade `match-sorter` from `4.1.0` to `6.1.0`\r\n2. Add a debounce delay of 200 milliseconds to reduce excessive rendering (and searching)\r\n2. Set [`keepDiacritics`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/match-sorter#keepdiacritics-boolean) to `true` to improve performance\r\n3. Display count of filtered results in \"Showing x of xx\", instead of the total results\r\n3. Rank certified metrics to the top.\r\n    - **Without such ranking**:\r\n       <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/105442875-6e58ff80-5c1f-11eb-8205-e49fd26e5e33.png\" width=\"300\">\r\n    - **With ranking**:\r\n       <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/105442897-7add5800-5c1f-11eb-9e30-d926630fed7f.png\" width=\"300\">\r\n\r\nSupersedes #12600 \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Go to a datasource with many metrics or simulate large list of metrics by modifying the code\r\n2.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds implicit ordering for the line chart and the word cloud chart. Currently, if a line chart has a group by, the series is limited in number, and there is no sort specified, the series selected will be arbitrary rather than the top series based on the metric. Similarly, the word cloud chart, if limited, will select an arbitrary set of results, rather than the top results based on the metric.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCreate a line chart with group by, limit the series number, and the top N series should be shown. Similarly with the word cloud chart, apply a limit, and the top results should be displayed rather than an arbitrary set.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nIt feels like lately CI workflows wait for hours before triggering next to release due-date when many PR's are active.\r\nWe should push the contributers to start Draft PR's which reduce the amount of  'ready to merge' PRs active in parallel.\r\nthis will enable the remaining group to run in iterations much more faster \r\n\r\nsolution:\r\nWhen a PR is a draft CI would skip\r\nevery additional commit(push) would still skip CI\r\nwhen PR is changed to **ready for review** this would trigger the workflow again and CI would run\r\n\r\nonce PR gets merged CI should just run again

The related endpoints are paginated to prevent heavy queries on the metadata database, these endpoints are normally used to fill up dropdowns on the frontend.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdd cross filter functionality that gives option to charts to filter other charts\r\n\r\nDescription according @ktmud questions\r\n\r\n1 .This feature is small POC that shows how to support cross-filter functionality between charts.\r\nIt partially based on `Native Filters` functionality with small differences:\r\n\r\n - it uses `setExtraFormData` hook passed to chart that save data in redux nativeFilter domain (same like native filters) (not sure if it will be changed in future or not)\r\n - when we get data for charts filtering it takes data from native filters domain redux by registered native filters and also by other charts that were registered with property `isNativeFilters` (I think we use this property only for POC, next we will change it to different property for cross-filtering (cc @villebro))\r\n\r\n2. \"Select\" Chart it's a native filter that take options like other charts from explore settings\r\n\r\n3. We looked in implementation of `filter_box` filtering logic and it's too coupled to `filter_box` structure and it's decoupling can take a lot of time and can cause regression, so we decided reimplement this logic from scratch \r\n\r\nNext steps to implement:\r\n- Add support for scoping cross-filters\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

SUMMARY\r\nThis adds an order by clause for the bar chart, ordering by the first metric descending. Without the ordering, the query will return an arbitrary set of rows if the query is limited, rather than the top N rows.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCreate a bar chart against a dataset. Limit the result to something less than the total number of rows. The top N rows, based on the metric, should be returned.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nFixes #12622 \r\n\r\n- [X] Has associated issue: #12622 \r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB

Remove unnecessary scroll bars\r\n2. Remove mysterious box shadow in chart panel\r\n3. Add extra spacing to dropdown menus close to container bottom when opened\r\n4. Allow horizontal scrolls for the dropdown menus so users can see full text of all options (wanted to allow auto-width like in SQL Lab table selector (see below), but it turns out to be much harder to do on the Explore page. We should probably just use `position: absolute` columns once #12593 is merged). \r\n\r\n<img

AdhocMetric/Filter popover back to `react-select` so that the same solution can be applied to address #12640 .\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nVisual verification.\r\n\r\nI recommend testing on the

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen installing and running Superset 1.0.0 on Python 3.8 via `pip`, an exception is raised for a missing module. This due to the [`typing-extensions`](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/) package not being pulled in automatically on Python 3.8, which is needed to support [`typing.Literal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal) on Python 3.7 and being used in `superset/utils/log.py` (introduced in #11927).\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTest locally that Superset works on both 3.7 and 3.8\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nJust realized we've had duplicate CI workflows for Presto and Hive for a couple of months.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate series of events happened as follows:\r\n\r\n1. I split Presto and Hive into their own workflows in September: #10821\r\n2. They were added back to `superset-frontend.yml` in #10784 , probably by an improper handling of merge conflicts\r\n3. @etr2460 split them again in November: #11794 --- by that time I already forgot I already did the split just two months ago.... ü§¶ \r\n4. I combined them into one workflow in #12090 , in hope to reduce jobs in queue.\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up the Presto and Hive tests' standalone workflow files but keep the combined one `superset-frontend-hive-presto.yml`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI should pass\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

EDIT\r\n\r\nInstead of the decorator approach described below I implemented the guard as a custom unit test.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a decorator called `guard`, used to protect public APIs from breaking changes without a major version bump (see https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/12566). If the API is changed the user receives a warning.\r\n\r\nFor example, we allow people to specify a custom function called `SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR` in their `superset_config.py`. This API **is already broken**, since the signature described in `superset/config.py` is out-of-sync with how it's actually called:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# superset/config.py\r\n# A function that intercepts the SQL to be executed and can alter it.\r\n# The use case is can be around adding some sort of comment header\r\n# with information such as the username and worker node information\r\n#\r\n#    def SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR(sql, username, security_manager):\r\n#        dttm = datetime.now().isoformat()\r\n#        return f\"-- [SQL LAB] {username} {dttm}\\n{sql}\"\r\nSQL_QUERY_MUTATOR = None\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we look at where the function is called we can see that the signature should be slightly different:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# superset/sql_lab.py\r\nSQL_QUERY_MUTATOR = config[\"SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR\"]\r\n...\r\nif SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR:\r\n        sql = SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR(sql, user_name, security_manager, database)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the extra `database` argument, and the small difference between `username` and `user_name`. This was probably changed at some point without updating the config, breaking any existing `SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR` that don't expect the `database` argument!\r\n\r\nTo prevent this in the future, we create a dummy function and protect it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@guard(\"W}V8JTUVzx4ur~{CEhT?\")\r\ndef dummy_sql_query_mutator(\r\n    sql: str,\r\n    user_name: str,\r\n    security_manager: SupersetSecurityManager,\r\n    database: Database,\r\n) -> str:\r\n    \"\"\"A no-op version of SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR\"\"\"\r\n    return sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe change the code a little bit so that the function is always called (either the custom or the dummy one):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nSQL_QUERY_MUTATOR = config.get(\"SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR\") or dummy_sql_query_mutator\r\n...\r\nsql = SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR(sql, user_name, security_manager, database)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow what happens if we change the signature of the function? Let's try it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@guard(\"W}V8JTUVzx4ur~{CEhT?\")\r\ndef dummy_sql_query_mutator(\r\n    sql: str,\r\n    user_name: str,\r\n    security_manager: SupersetSecurityManager,\r\n    database: Database,\r\n    foo: int,\r\n) -> str:\r\n    \"\"\"A no-op version of SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR\"\"\"\r\n    return sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging the code like this will print the following warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/beto/Projects/incubator-superset/superset/utils/decorators.py:125: UserWarning: The decorated object\r\n`dummy_sql_query_mutator` (in /Users/beto/Projects/incubator-superset/superset/sql_lab.py line 54) has a\r\npublic interface which has currently been modified. This MUST only be released in a new major version of\r\nSuperset according to SIP-57. To remove this warning message update the hash in the `guard` decorator to\r\n';>K{8wd)&8!=9?1qR@Ja'.\r\n\r\n    @guard(\"W}V8JTUVzx4ur~{CEhT?\")\r\n    def dummy_sql_query_mutator(\r\n        sql: str,\r\n        user_name: str,\r\n        security_manager: SupersetSecurityManager,\r\n        database: Database,\r\n        foo: int,\r\n    ) -> str:\r\n        \"\"\"A no-op version of SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR\"\"\"\r\n        return sql\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps

SUMMARY\r\nWe are seeing exponential growth of `alert.run_query` tasks in our Celery queues, likely due to the permissive scheduling window combined with multiple task retries. This PR 1) reduces the schedule window from 1hr to a few minutes, 2) reduces the retry count from 5 to 1, and 3) removes the arbitrary `soft_time_limit` value.\r\n\r\nAlso adding a deprecation notice to this module, as it's been replaced by https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/11711\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nAlert scheduling should function without exponential growth of celery task queues.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nUpdating the \"Cancel Duplicates\" job to use our own Python script, which will try to cancel all duplicate jobs of all workflows:\r\n\r\n1. For each workflow, we keep only the latest run for a given branch + event type (`pull_request` or `push`).\r\n2. Older runs will be cancelled even if they are already running.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of using a custom Python script instead of a black-box like 3rd party action is that even if the cancel workflow is blocked be other long-running jobs scheduled before it, committers can still run the script locally to trigger the cancellation.\r\n\r\nTried to use https://github.com/potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs#most-often-used-canceling-example\r\nbut it's not very easy to configure.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nThe job should start correctly and duplicate runs should be properly cancelled. \r\n\r\nTested on my personal fork.\r\n\r\nCheck https://github.com/ktmud/superset/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Cancel+Duplicates%22 or verification.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nThe FilterBox visualization renders an unnecessary horizontal scroll bar when a time range filter control is present. On some browsers (e.g. Safari), this scroll bar can get in the way of the drop down if the drop down is near the scroll bar. This PR removes the overflow CSS property causing this.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 6 19 06 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5475421/105187388-95acb100-5ae7-11eb-909f-fd5448ae1587.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 6 19 24 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5475421/105187417-9e04ec00-5ae7-11eb-8f8a-0f23e7c1d81e.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCreate a filter box and check the `Date filter` option. An unneeded horizontal scroll bar should show up. This happens both in the chart explore and if on a dashboard.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\nSaved metrics added to controls did not have a unique id - we distinguished them only by their names. If we added the same saved metric twice and then tried to edit 1, both items were being edited, because their names were equal.\r\nThis PR introduces a `savedMetricId`, which is added to a metric when it's added to controls via the metrics popover.\r\nThe saved metrics that had been added before this PR will not have this param until they are removed and added again, however everything should still work as expected.\r\n**_The only case when the bug will still happen is if 2 or more exactly the same saved metrics are already in controls panel before this change is introduced. In such case, removing the metric and adding it again in control panel will fix the issue._**\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/12611\r\nCloses

This code will become more important soon, and I'll give it more attention in terms of styling, but it should fix some potential security issues, and _maybe_ some performance issues (TBD). It needs a lot of styling help, but it seems plausible after doing some quick tire-kicking with this technique.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nUpgrade Cypress to 6.2.1 with some required refactoring:\r\n\r\n1. Remove `readResponseBlob` since the new `cy.intercept(..)` API already reads JSON responses automatically.\r\n2. Remove `verifyResponseCodes` since it's very unlikely that we get an incorrect status code yet still receive the correct response.\r\n3. Add a [`FormData` parser](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/f3d642a3920d40033be57bdf07f5269e02bc695a/superset-frontend/cypress-base/cypress/utils/parsePostForm.ts) since `request.body` is no longer a native `FormData` object\r\n4. Replace a couple of `.should('not.visible')` to `.should('not.exist')` because Cypress will now throw errors for elements that do not exist.\r\n\r\nUpgrading since I wanted to add more tests for time-series table and box plot viz.\r\n\r\nReference: [Cypress's official migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide.html)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI must pass\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes translation files and updates translation generation docs. \r\n\r\nPreviously most translations were commented and line number references in PO files were broken. When we followed the instructions in the section `Translating` of `CONTRIBUTING.md` all new texts were also commented and old texts were kept in translation files causing maintainability issues. Since all translation file texts were commented the PO to JSON generation also failed because it wouldn't identify any change.\r\n\r\nTo fix these issues I applied the following process in this PR:\r\n- Uncommented all translation file texts\r\n- Updated all translation files with new texts and line number references\r\n- Merged previous translations with updated files\r\n- Removed all old texts (unused)\r\n- Changed the section `Translating` of `CONTRIBUTING.md` with new instructions to reflect this workflow\r\n- Enabled i18n and tested language shifts\r\n- I also created a script to help PO to JSON translation\r\n\r\nNow if we follow the new translation instructions we'll have our files being correctly updated without introducing maintainability issues.\r\n\r\nI also fully translated Superset to Brazilian Portuguese üôåüèº . This has two major objectives:\r\n- Support a new language\r\n- Have a fully completed translation file. This will enable translation completion tests. As you can see in the screenshots some parts of the UI are not being translated and this means that we have texts in the application that are not encapsulated by translation functions.\r\n\r\nThe last contribution of this PR is about version release. We should always update our translation files when we release a new version. This ensures that customers who rely on translation or community contributions have access to the updated PO and JSON files for the version.\r\n\r\nThis PR is also a requirement for our capitalization work # 12343 because we need the translation process to work correctly so that we can change the texts and not lose the previous translations.\r\n\r\n@junlincc @rusackas @ktmud @mihir174\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR changes Python CI workflows to skip unit test execution for PRs that don't have changes that are relevant for those workflows. Here we're leveraging [`continue-on-error`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepscontinue-on-error) to check if files relevant to unit tests have changed, namely\r\n\r\nPython changes:\r\n- `tests/*`\r\n- `superset/*`\r\n- `requirements/*.txt`\r\n- `setup.py`\r\n\r\nFrontend changes:\r\n- `superset_frontend/*`\r\n\r\nThis is done to ensure that skipped workflows return a successful status for required checks despite not executing the expensive test steps. If any of the aforementioned file have changed, a failure exit code is triggered, which subsequent steps listen in on; if the check step returned a failure, the tests run, otherwise they are skipped. \r\nTo check changes, run `check_no_file_changes.sh` with the following arguments (the `GITHUB_REPO` and `PR_NUMBER` env variables need to be set):\r\n- Only check python changes: `./check_no_file_changes.sh python`\r\n- Only check frontend changes: `./check_no_file_changes.sh frontend`\r\n- Check python and frontend changes: `./check_no_file_changes.sh python frontend` (order doesn't matter)\r\n\r\nE2E tests have not been included in this PR, as some steps there depend in `failure()` which might need tweaking to run properly with this script.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nExample of skipped frontend changes:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/107039315-658f2e80-67c6-11eb-9e4d-23a10f896990.png)\r\nThis shows the results for a PR with python changes:\r\n```\r\nSearching for changes in python files\r\nDetected changes...

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently a user can edit a name of saved metric in popover, but the change doesn't show anywhere, because this feature is not implemented for saved metrics yet. This PR disables name edit feature for saved metrics.\r\nAlso, now \"Saved\" is a default tab in Metrics popover. When user opens a popover, \"Saved\" tab is selected by default, unless there are no saved metrics for current dataset.\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/12578\r\n\r\n###
