PR addresses a bug with waiting for segments to be loaded. In the case of append, segments would be created with the same version.

Description\r\n\r\nPlanning queries with ordering on arrays throws an error, since there isn't a `StringComparator` associated with it. `StringComparator` is an old concept, when dimensions were strings only, and a string dimension could have its ordering defined based on what the string represented. For example, for numeric strings, it could be set to `NUMERIC`.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the native engine, the comparators are bypassed altogether if the type of the dimension is the natural comparator for that dimension. In the case of numeric dimensions, the `NUMERIC` comparator is the natural comparator. SQL always sets the comparator such that it gets bypassed in the native layer, therefore comparators can used only by used via native queries. \r\n\r\nWith MSQ, we can now have order by's with scan queries on arrays. To represent a natural ordering on a type for which we don't have a defined ordering, we add a `NATURAL` comparator, which is similar to setting the `NUMERIC` comparator on the `numeric` types, i.e. it should get bypassed and the natural ordering should be used. Alternatively is a dummy value for representing `StringComparator = null` and its a no-op. \r\n\r\nFixes a bug when executing queries like\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT int_array FROM foo ORDER BY int_array`\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #15054.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n-  Currently, If 2 tasks are consuming from the same partitions, try to publish the segment and update the metadata, the second task can fail because the end offset stored in the metadata store doesn't match with the start offset of the second task. We can fix this by retrying instead of failing.\r\n- AFAIK apart from the above issue, the metadata mismatch can happen in 2 scenarios:\r\n   \r\n    1. when we update the input topic name for the data source\r\n    2. when we run 2 replicas of ingestion tasks(1 replica will publish and 1 will fail as the first replica has already updated the metadata).\r\n    \r\n- Implemented the comparable function to compare the last committed end offset and new Sequence start offset. And return a specific error msg for this.\r\n- Add retry logic on indexers to retry for this specific error msg. \r\n- Updated the existing test case.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

What is the purpose of this PR\r\n- This PR fixes the error resulting from the flaky test ``org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest``\r\n- The mentioned test may fail or pass without changes made to the source code when it is run in different JVMs due to `Json`'s non-deterministic iteration order.\r\n\r\n### Why the test fails\r\nThe test `testBasicAuthenticationAndNewlineSeparating` fails due to the order of byte buffer data returned by the `org.asynchttpclient.Request` object is non-deterministic. This issue arises because asynchronous methods can process data in a different order from the order of reception\r\n\r\n### Reproduce the test failure\r\n- Run the test with [NonDex maven plugin](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex). The command to recreate the flaky test failures is:\r\n\r\n`mvn -pl org.apache.druid:druid-processing edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=\"org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest#testBasicAuthenticationAndNewlineSeparating\"`\r\n\r\n- Fixing the flaky test now may prevent unreliable test results in future code changes.\r\n\r\n### Expected results\r\nThe test should run successfully when run with NonDex.\r\n\r\nTest failing before changes:\r\n> [ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4.573 s <<< FAILURE! -- in org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest.testBasicAuthenticationAndNewlineSeparating -- Time elapsed: 4.561 s <<< FAILURE! java.lang.AssertionError at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:87)\r\n\r\nEXPECTED: \r\n{\"metrics\":{\"value\":1},\"feed\":\"test\"}\r\n{\"metrics\":{\"value\":2},\"feed\":\"test\"}\r\n\r\nBUT FOUND:\r\n{\"feed\":\"test\",\"metrics\":{\"value\":1}}\r\n{\"metrics\":{\"value\":2},\"feed\":\"test\"}\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n- Instead of directly comparing strings that represent JSON objects, compare the equality of complete JSON trees by evaluating the equality of their corresponding root nodes. \r\n- Utilize [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) to read the input JSON as a JsonNode and compare them. Even when the order of attributes in the input JSON variables differs, the `equals()` method will disregard the order and consider them as

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nWhen running higher volumes of ingestion on the KubernetesTaskRunner (especially streaming) there are some issues caused by the difference between the Kubernetes lifecycle (pod startup and completion) and the Druid Task lifecycle (when a peon JVM has spun up and is ready to serve requests and when it has shut down)\r\n\r\n- During streaming task startup, in AbstractTask.setup, the getChatHandlerProvider gets registered after the UpdateLocation action submission. This can cause issues if there is a lot of load on the overlord because the task will get stuck retrying these /action submissions even though its chat handler has not been registered and the supervisor can't actually communicate with the task yet.\r\n\r\n- Similarly, the UpdateLocation action during AbstractTask.cleanUp also frequently causes issues during streaming task cleanup when there is a lot of load on the overlord. The cleanUp method is called after the chat handler provider is deregistered, so when the task gets stuck doing cleanup, there is a risk of the supervisor trying to chat with the task while it is in the process of existing.\r\n\r\n\r\n-On larger Kubernetes clusters, it can take a while for K8s to report that a pod has successfully exited, meaning there can be a significant lag between when a peon JVM exits and when the KubernetesTaskRunner can report a task as completed. In general this slows down how quickly tasks can be reported as successful and can also cause similar issues to the above UpdateLocation actions with streaming tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a tradeoff between having the peon hit the /action endpoint on the overlord with UpdateStatusAction and UpdateLocationAction to give the K8s task runner a more accurate account of where the peon is in the task lifecycle vs the time/chance of failure that these requests add.\r\n\r\nMy overall approach was to let the KubernetesTaskRunner/KubernetesPeonLifeycle (stuff running on the overlord) handle the Kubernetes/TaskLocation lifecycle, but have the peon be directly responsible for the task lifecycle by using the UpdateStatusAction as a way to mark the task future as complete.\r\n\r\nFollowing this approach, I made two significant changes\r\n- I removed all the UpdateLocationAction calls in the peon and let the k8s task runner handle managing the tasks location itself.  Specifically, the k8s task runner now notifies listeners that a task's location has changed when the k8s pod gets its ip and when the k8s pod lifecycle completes.\r\n- I separated the k8s lifecycle logic from the druid task lifecycle logic. The exec service in KubernetesTaskRunner is still responsible for submitting a K8s job for a task, waiting for the pod to come up, and then deleting the pod when it completes, but run(Task) no longer returns this future as the status of the Task. Instead, run(Task) returns a settable future that gets completed either when the Kubernetes lifecycle completes or when the UpdateStatusAction is sent from the peon. This means that tasks will now complete when the peon finishes its cleanup and notifies the k8s task runner that it has completed.\r\n\r\nI also made a few small cleanup changes\r\n- registerListener should call notifyStatus on the new listener for running tasks.\r\n- Removed the PeonPhase class since it wasn't serving any purpose.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Cleanup lifecycle management of tasks in mm-less task scheduling\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesTaskRunner`\r\n * `KubernetesPeonLifecycle`\r\n * `AbstractTask`\r\n *  `KubernetesWorkItem`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nFollow on to #14918\r\n\r\nSome cluster administrators may want to send particular tasks to the worker task runner instead of k8sTaskRunner, as the task startup time is usually faster on the worker task runner system.\r\n\r\nAn example use case is high throughput streaming ingestion where a long pod startup time can result in user visible lag. To get around this, an administrator could configure the cluster to have enough idle capacity to reasonably handle the high throughput stream and configure all other tasks to be handled by the k8s task runner while the streaming tasks are handled by the worker task runner.\r\n\r\nThe other idea I explored was implementing something like `WorkerSelectStrategy` for the `KubernetesAndWorkerTaskRunner` to provide more flexibility. But I was not certain whether or not the added complexity of this implementation was worth it, so I went with the simpler approach\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Root Cause\r\nThe tests testDateHandling, FlattenSpecParquetReaderTest has been reported as flaky when ran against the [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool. The tests failed because it was trying to compare the two Json strings, where the JSON library internally uses HashMap. The HashMap in Java does not store the inserted order of keys and their values. As a result, when the expected Json string (hard-coded) is compared with the actual one, it failed.\r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nUsed the Jackson library which contains JsonNode and ObjectMapper. These are used to parse two JSON strings to tree models and compare these trees node by node. So when we use this, the order of the elements in the JSON strings is ignored and only the content is checked.\r\n\r\n### How this has been tested?\r\n\r\n**Java:** openjdk version \"11.0.20.1\"\r\n**Maven:** Apache Maven 3.6.3\r\n\r\n1) **Module build** - Successful\r\nCommand used - \r\n```\r\nmvn install -pl infra/common -am -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) **Regular test**  - Successful\r\nCommand used - \r\n\r\ntestDateHandling: `mvn -pl extensions-core/parquet-extensions test Dtest=org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.TimestampsParquetReaderTest#testDateHandling`\r\n\r\nFlattenSpecParquetReaderTest: `mvn -pl extensions-core/parquet-extensions test Dtest=org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.FlattenSpecParquetReaderTest#testFlat1NoFlattenSpec`\r\n\r\n3) **NonDex test**  - Failed\r\nCommand used - \r\n\r\ntestDateHandling: `mvn -pl extensions-core/parquet-extensions edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex Dtest=org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.TimestampsParquetReaderTest#testDateHandling`\r\n\r\nFlattenSpecParquetReaderTest: `mvn edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -pl extensions-core/parquet-extensions Dtest=org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.FlattenSpecParquetReaderTest#testFlat1NoFlattenSpec`\r\nNonDex test passed after the fix.\r\n\r\nNonDex test passed after the fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Description\r\n\r\nDuplicates a bunch of tests in `CalciteArraysQueryTest` to test real array columns using some of the same data used by the limited array tests of `CalciteNestedDataQueryTest` to get a lot more coverage on array typed columns.\r\n\r\nIn the process discovered a bug with filter pushdown in `UnnestStorageAdapter` when filtering on unnested array columns, where it was pushing down the filter on the unnested output column when the input was an array typed column, which is totally incorrect. I think i've modified things to behave correctly...\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR.

Description\r\n\r\n`EARLIEST` and `LATEST` operators implicitly reference the `__time` column for calculation of the aggregate value. Since the reference isn't explicit, Calcite sometimes fails to update the `__time` column name when there's column renaming --such as in the case of nested queries -- resulting in column not found errors. \r\n\r\nThis change rewrites these operators to `EARLIEST_BY` and `LATEST_BY` during query processing to make the reference explicit to Calcite.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nMSQ uses the string dimension schema for `ARRAY<STRING>` typed columns, which creates MVDs instead of string arrays as is correct. Therefore someone trying to ingest columns of type `ARRAY<STRING>` from an external data source or another data source would get `STRING` columns in the newly generated segments.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a `arrayIngestMode` query context parameter with the following behavior:\r\n1. If mode is `array`, uses auto dimension schema to correctly ingest the `ARRAY<STRING>` columns as `ARRAY<STRING>` columns, and also allows numeric `ARRAY` types to be ingested\r\n2. If mode is `mvd`, currently default to ease the transition, `ARRAY<STRING>` will continue to ingest as `STRING` typed MVDs, but logs will warn operators that this is a deprecated mode. Numeric arrays cannot be ingested in this mode.\r\n3. If mode is `none`, neither string or numeric `ARRAY` types can be ingested, this mode will be used as a forcing mechanism to force people to choose if they explicitly want MVDs or ARRAY typed columns, and in either case, suggest setting the mode to `array` and explicitly use `ARRAY_TO_MV` if users still want MVDs.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nMSQ supports a new array mode `arrayIngestMode` which specifies the behavior of MSQ while ingesting arrays. Please refer to the docs in the release for a detailed behavior of what each option specifies. The default 'mvd' is the existing behaviour of MSQ, therefore doesn't require immediate intervention, however it is subject to removal in future releases.  \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes duplication of data with concurrent append and replace jobs.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nConsider the following events:\r\n\r\n-Segments S1, S2, S3 exist\r\n-Compact acquires replace lock\r\n-Append publishes a segment S4 which needs to be carried forward\r\n-Compact task processes S1-S4 to create new segments\r\n-Compact task publishes new segments and carries S4 forward\r\n\r\nThis can lead to the data in S4 being duplicated\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n### Approach: \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new task action to fetch only those segments that were present before the REPLACE lock was acquired.\r\n\r\nRetrieveSegmentsToReplaceAction:\r\n1. Implement the method getSupervisorTaskId at the level of AbstractBatchSubtask.\r\n2. Fetch all replace locks for datasource using getAllReplaceLocksForDatasource, and filter those that have the same supervisorId.\r\n3. Fetch segments and created_date for the interval of the action.\r\n4. For each segment, find a replace lock in the filtered set whose interval contains its own interval and filter based on created_date and lock_version\r\n\r\nThis new action is utilized by the DruidInputSource.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes a case missed in #14422, where paths with a mix of only a single type of scalar value and empty arrays would incorrectly get treated as single type scalar columns, resulting in serialization failure with errors of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.druid.error.DruidException: Value not found in string dictionary\r\n\r\n\tat

org.apache.druid.segment.nested.NestedDataColumnSerializer$1.processArrayField(NestedDataColumnSerializer.java:132)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the exception is being thrown from `processArrayField` but the writer is a `ScalarStringFieldColumnWriter`. This could happen with any combination of scalar type if only encountered empty arrays and no other array values. The problem occurred because the 'type byte' of `FieldTypeInfo` is used to check for \"single type\" fields to optimize, but was forgetting to check for the presence of the empty array flag. Empty arrays do not set a type at the time of indexing since they don't really have a type similar to nulls, so as to not pollute the type byte with an artificially chosen type. The intention was that at persist type we check for the flag and add an array type of the scalar type if otherwise a single type, to promote it to being mixed type and preserve the array dictionary, or just remain a single type if the single type is a typed array type.\r\n\r\nThe added column to the test data triggered this issue in a number of tests, and I also added some tests for the empty array flag for the field type info tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

added the feature of allowing the waiting for segments to be loaded to the MSQ controller. This adds a context parameter to control if this behaviour should be used. It also optimizes the query to make fewer calls to the broker by clubbing all the versions into the same request.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Add `waitTillSegmentsLoad` as a query context parameter. If this is true, the controller queries the broker and waits till the segments created (if any) have been loaded by the load rules. The controller also provides this information in the live reports and task reports. If this is false, the controller exits immediately after finishing the query.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

The default value is documented, but the upper limit of 1MB (set [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/07c28f17ca6020c1cc0fa954d19b9b0cc8d32c1b/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/initialization/BatchDataSegmentAnnouncerConfig.java)) is not. When deploying with a value above that limit, the process crashes, since the configuration is considered invalid. This PR documents the allowed range.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nDocumented the allowed range of the batch segment announcer's maximum ZNode size.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\nThis PR modifies Druid native filters to correctly observe SQL [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic#SQL) (`true`, `false`, `unknown`) instead of Druids classic two-state logic, with a new `druid.generic.useThreeValueLogicForNativeFilters` which defaults to true and also `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans` is set to true and `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull` is false (both the defaults in upcoming Druid 28, see #14154). \r\n\r\nThe most prominent example of what is fixed by this is something like the following query\r\n\r\n<img width=\"584\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-07 at 8 30 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/a16d34bc-08f3-4310-906f-6a25fd5bb5a2\">\r\n\r\nwhich prior to this change would incorrect match null values, but after behaves in SQL compliant fashion and only matches actual values:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"609\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-07 at 8 29 46 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/b4fb2d17-51e7-412b-ae41-74c569ade383\">\r\n\r\nThis change has only been done in SQL compatible/strict boolean mode to be consistent with the behavior of Druids native expressions, which already using the correct tri-state logic system if these flags were in place.\r\n\r\n#### Design\r\nThe design is pretty-straightforward, involves modifying the 3 interfaces involved in Druid native filter matching, `BitmapColumnIndex`,  `ValueMatcher`, and `VectorValueMatcher`,  to accept an additional boolean `includeUnknown` argument when computing their matches.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface BitmapColumnIndex\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  <T> T computeBitmapResult(BitmapResultFactory<T> bitmapResultFactory, boolean includeUnknown);\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface ValueMatcher extends HotLoopCallee\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  boolean matches(boolean includeUnknown);\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface VectorValueMatcher extends VectorSizeInspector\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  ReadableVectorMatch match(ReadableVectorMatch mask, boolean includeUnknown);\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea is fairly simple, when `includeUnknown` is `false`, filters only consider rows matching when the match is definitely true, and when `includeUnknown` is `true`, the filters consider both definitely true and also 'unknown' values as matches. This primarily comes into play when a `NotFilter` is involved, during which we only want to match the values of a filter that are definitely false. So the `NotFilter` will flip the value of `includeUnknown`, delegating to the child filter what it actually considers 'unknown', to get matches for both `TRUE` and `UNKNOWN`, which it can then invert to translate into matches that are only `FALSE.\r\n\r\nFor example, the native equality filter, something like `x = 'hello'`, with `includeUnknown` set to `false` will match all rows that have the value `'hello'`. For something like `x != 'hello'`, the `NotFilter` will call the match methods of the child equality filter with `includeUnknown` set to true, which will consider rows with `'hello'` as matches, and also rows with `NULL` as matches, which the `NotFilter` can then flip to consider all of the rows with non-null values that are not equal to `'hello'` as the matches.\r\n\r\nAnother example that handles `includeUnknown` differently (which is not actually present in this PR, but I am planning to add in a follow-up PR) would be something like a native \"is true\" filter. The \"is true\" filter considers non-null truthy values as matches regardless of the value of `includeUnknown` since it doesn't have any \"unknown\" values, the rows are either definitely true or definitely not true, so something like `is not true` the child filter would still only return the rows that match true, allowing the not filter to correctly match rows with both false and unknown values.\r\n\r\nFor predicate based filters, `DruidPredicateFactory` has a new method added,\r\n```\r\n  default boolean isNullInputUnknown()\r\n  {\r\n    return true;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nwhich is used to indicate if null inputs to the predicate should be considered as 'unknowns' and automatically match whenever 'includeUnknown' is set to true, or if they should be delegated to the predicate to have it directly match the value, since some predicates do in fact match null values (such as bloom filters, various expression filters, etc).\r\n\r\n#### Rejected Designs\r\nWe primarily considered two other designs before moving forward with this one.\r\n\r\n##### Separate unknown matching methods\r\nOne approach involved instead of adding an argument to these native matching interfaces to instead have additional methods to split out 'unknown' matching, e.g. adding a `boolean unknown();` method to the `ValueMatcher` interface, and similar for index and vector matchers. In some ways, I actually still kind of prefer this approach because it is nice and tidy and unknown matching is handled completely separately from 'definitely true' matching, however in practice it had a pretty big downside, which is that the `VectorValueMatcher` implementations are effectively forced to maintain two vectors, one for the true selection and one for the unknown selection,  or alternately iterate the vector twice if the unknowns are asked for, and also greatly increased the complexity of vector matcher implementations. We were also unable to think of any benefit to being able to keep the unknowns separated from the matches, so we went with the argument approach instead.\r\n\r\n##### Simulate it in the SQL layer\r\nThis approach involved just making the SQL planner introduce the necessary extra native filters required to ensure correct behavior entirely in the SQL planner, and is basically sketched out in #14949. The idea is like for something like `x != 'hello'` we plan into a native `and(not(eq(x, 'hello')), not(null(x))`. There are some nice things about this approach, like not having to modify the native layer at all, but ultimately the downsides were worry that it could never be as performant as supporting this directly at the native layer, greatly increased complexity of the filter analysis step in the sql planner, the requirement to introduce a filter optimizer to remove duplicated filters added implicitly to map two to three valued logic, and lastly, the cognitive burden of the SQL layer having a different behavior than queries run directly at the native layer due to the filters which would be added implicitly at the SQL layer to produce correct behavior from the native layer.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nDruid filtering now correctly observes SQL [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic#SQL) (`true`, `false`, `unknown`) instead of Druids classic two-state logic whenever `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans = true` and `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull = false`. This will potentially change query results when these configuration values are set, particularly when NOT filters are involved, but for the better as queries should behave as one would expect when using SQL.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n- Based off of http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p2195-masson.pdf and uses the corresponding https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java library\r\n- contains tests for post building and using aggregation/post aggregation.\r\n- New aggregator: `ddSketch`\r\n- New post aggregators: `quantileFromDDSketch` and `quantilesFromDDSketch`\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNew: `druid-ddsketch` Extension. DDSketches can be built off of raw numeric data or merged from other DDSketches that have been preaggregated. DDSketches are then used to calculate quantiles with relative error guarantees with bounded space.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DDSketchAggregatorFactory`: Sets defaults up for aggregators. notably relativeError = 0.01 and numBins = 1000\r\n * `DDSketchAggregator`: Does the accepting of new values and merging of other DDSketches.\r\n * `DDSketchBufferAggregator`: same as above but using the buffer.\r\n * `DDSketchComplexMetricSerde`: registers the serde\r\n * `DDSketchObjectStrategy`: Strategy for managing the objects/serialization/deserialization\r\n * `DDSketchToQuantilePostAggregator`: Sets up the postAggregator `quantileFromDDSketch`\r\n * `DDSketchToQuantilesPostAggregator`: Sets up the postAggregator `quantilesFromDDSketch`\r\n * `DDSketchUtils`: Utility functions around serialization/deserialization using `protobuf`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

of the testcases were disabled in `CalciteWindowQueryTest` during the Calcite-1.35 upgrade; there were some changes arising from the fact that the removal of `DRUID_SUM` had some unexpected sideffects:\r\n* `SqlStdOperatorTable.SUM` became the `SUM` operator\r\n* because of that `SqlToRelConverter` started rewriting windowed `SUM` -s into `SUM0` -s \r\n* my opinion is that w.r.t to Druid this rewrite provides no real advantage - as `SUM0` is serviced by `SUM` [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/8e22a178cc9925fd28ff3bd738fa01f0888eea7c/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/aggregation/builtin/SumZeroSqlAggregator.java#L25C43-L25C59)\r\n    * I believe that's not 100% correct in cases when it aggregates just `null`-s but that doesnt matter in this case\r\n\r\nI propose to introduce back a local `DRUID_SUM` thing as an unchanged `SUM` and later when CALCITE-6020 is fixed ; we can drop that.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.","created_at":"2023-09-27T07:20:21Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:45:10Z","closed_at":"2023-10-03T04:48:44Z","merged_at":"2023-10-03T04:48:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3d1c8b70ee692c6208f91f190578bc2d6e4eec7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area
