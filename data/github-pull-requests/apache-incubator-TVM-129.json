is a refactor to make the relay IR easier to use for users who are more familiar with graph style DSL. It contains the following changes. I make them in one PR because they are tied together on making the construction and debugging of IR easy.\r\n\r\n- [x] A new TextPrinter, which replaces the original debug printer by @MarisaKirisame \r\n    - It uses a graph style printing for nested common Exprs in a DAG.\r\n    - It introduces a meta-data section, that allows us to serialize any tvm node as metadata.\r\n    - Print of the call attribute is now supported, which only prints out the non-default arguments.\r\n    - The text format generally follows the proposal by @joshpoll in #1782 with the following difference\r\n       - Tensor type are in form of Tensor[shape, base_type] (to be consistent with the constructor)\r\n       - use full name function instead of fn\r\n       - The text format is not finalized and can subject to discussion.\r\n- [x] Refactor Function, change the position of ret_type and body\r\n    - The rationale behind this is that usually, people construct function without specifying return types.\r\n- [x] introduce relay.var, relay.const as a quick wrapper to create var and const.\r\n- [x] Fix most serialization problem of relay IR, issues bought up by @slyubomirsky \r\n    - Need to followup PR with serialization testcases\r\n\r\nI will post a more elaborated discussion on what does it mean to have a graph-aware IR later\r\n\r\n## Example 0: Graph Print Format\r\n```python\r\ndef test_graph():\r\n    x = relay.var(\"x\", \"float32\")\r\n    y = relay.var(\"y\", \"float32\")\r\n    z = relay.add(x, y)\r\n    z = relay.add(z, z)\r\n    f = relay.Function([x, y], z)    \r\n    env = relay.Environment()\r\n    env.add(\"myf\", f)\r\n    print(env.astext())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill display the following result. Please note how the temporary variable %1 %0 are created to reflect the exact structure of the Expr relation. These are not explicit let, but just temporary graph variables. \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef @myf(%x: float32,\r\n         %y: float32) {\r\n  %0 = add(%x, %y) # ty=float32\r\n  %1 = add(%0, %0) # ty=float32\r\n  %1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example1: Conv with Meta Data\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_func():\r\n    n, c, h, w = tvm.var(\"n\"), 10, 224, 224\r\n    x = relay.var(\"x\", shape=(n, c, h, w))\r\n    w = relay.var(\"w\")\r\n    z = relay.nn.conv2d(x, w,\r\n                        kernel_size=(3, 3),\r\n                        padding=(1, 1),\r\n                        channels=2)\r\n    f = relay.Function([x, w], z)\r\n    print(f.astext())\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill get the following IR\r\n```\r\nfunction(%x: Tensor[(meta.Variable(id=0), 10, 224, 224), float32],\r\n         %w) {\r\n  %0 = nn.conv2d(%x, %w, padding=[1, 1], channels=2, kernel_size=[3, 3])\r\n  %0\r\n}\r\n# meta data ommitted\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example2: Mix Let and the Temporary Graph Node\r\n```python\r\ndef test_let_if_scope():\r\n    x = relay.var(\"x\", \"float32\")\r\n    y = relay.var(\"y\", \"float32\")\r\n    cond = relay.var(\"cond\", \"bool\")\r\n    v1 = relay.var(\"v\")\r\n    v2 = relay.var(\"v\", \"float32\")\r\n    then_branch = relay.Let(\r\n        v1, relay.const(1, \"float32\"),\r\n        relay.Let(v2, x, relay.subtract(v1, v2)))\r\n    v3 = relay.var(\"v\")\r\n    let2 = relay.Let(v3, y, v3)\r\n    else_branch = relay.add(let2, let2)\r\n    result = relay.If(cond, then_branch, else_branch)\r\n    f = relay.Function([x, y, cond], result)\r\n    show(f.astext())\r\n```\r\nWill display\r\n```\r\nfunction(%x: float32,\r\n         %y: float32,\r\n         %cond: bool) {\r\n  if (%cond) {\r\n    let %v = 1f\r\n    let %v1: float32 = %x\r\n    %0 = subtract(%v, %v1)\r\n    %0\r\n  }  else {\r\n    %1 = {\r\n      let %v2 = %y\r\n      %v2\r\n    }\r\n    %2 = add(%1, %1)\r\n    %2\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nOne noticable thing in the examples is that IR builder is not used, instead the expression is directly composed together with calls, wth function construction in the end. This is a preferrable way of doing DSL construction, as user usually construct a new gradually and collects the weight, instead of declaring weight in the beginning. This might also remove the need of IR Builder in common nn usecases.\r\n\r\nThe current TextPrinter is not yet perfect. The temporary graph node themselfs do not have scope, and the current TextPrinter can have funny result when there are shared  temporary graph node between parallel scopes(they will appear in the first scope), but if we disrecard the scope and just reconstruct the expression, the parsed expr is still valid.

the bool type(uint1) cannot be directly stored and have to be explicitly cast to int8 before we store. However, it is still useful to introduce the type bool as it is used extensively in numpy and other languages. This PR enables this\r\n\r\n- bool is stored as int8 \r\n- storage_flatten pass and buffer is updated to specially handle bool, and do type cast after loading, and before we store.\r\n- The frontend will print uint1 type directly as bool, so the type flag is numpy compatible

[`numpy.concatenate`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.concatenate.html) accepts ```axis=None```, in which case numpy flattens all input arrays before doing concat, while we do not support ```axis=None```.\r\n- [x] Numpy consistency: [`numpy.reshape`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html) is a subset of our `reshape`. I think it is fine (or even better).\r\n- [x] Flexibility: is it okay that `transpose` directly convert `Array<IndexExpr> axes` to `vector<int>`?\r\n\r\nRelated issue:

Did I miss anything?\r\n- [x] API inconsistency with [numpy.expand_dims](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.expand_dims.html). Our API looks like `expand_dims(data, axis, num_newaxis=1)`, but numpy API is `expand_dims(a, axis) `. I think it is okay because ours seem to be a superset.\r\n- [x] I implemented `axis` and `num_newaxis` as `int`. Wondering if it is possible to make them `IndexExpr`, so that `axis` could depend on some intermediate result of computation.\r\n\r\nI am working on the docstring, and @tqchen could you help comment
