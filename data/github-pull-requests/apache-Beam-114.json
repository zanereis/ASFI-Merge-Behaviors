think the various ValidateRunner V2 Dataflow tests are deleting images out from under each other. \r\n\r\nWhat I think is happening:\r\n1. Test 1 launches, pushes `gcr.io/.../java:$TIME_TAG1` with digest `sha256:$digest`\r\n2. Test 2 launches with no change in repo, pushes `gcr.io/.../java:$TIME_TAG2` which has the same digest `sha256:$digest`.\r\n3. Test 1 finishes, runs deletion with `--force-delete-images` on `gcr.io/.../java:$TIME_TAG1`, which deletes all associated tags/images for `$digest` (including `gcr.io/.../java:$TIME_TAG2`).\r\n4. Test 2 starts to fail.\r\n\r\nNew strategy untags the image, and then runs a cleanup script that removes any images that aren't tagged, so we don't delete an image by tag with multiple tags, and we run less risk of cleaning up a image in use (tests only use tagged image URLs). \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

order to resolve BEAM-12399 (Beam Go SDK docs can't be displayed on the standard GoDoc site pkg.go.dev) we need to separate out the CPython license stack from the other licenses which apply more broadly.\r\n\r\n* Moves that license text from LICENSE to LICENSE.python\r\n* Ensures the LICENSE.python file is also copied to the Python SDK distribution images.\r\n\r\nPer https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45095, and #46291 the issue is that the license not particularly compatible, so adding it as a recognized license is apparently not the way forward. However, as the license only needs to be posted with distributions of cpython, it largely only needs to go into the Python SDK container(s).  \r\n\r\nSince pkg.go.dev must be conservative about what it checks for LICENSE we can't pare down or filter what the site picks up (eg. a LICENSE.golang or a LICENSE in the sdks/go subdirectory file would only be added to whats in the root LICENSE, not supercede it). However, pkg.go.dev doesn't look at other LICENSE files for particular languages, hence the new file.\r\n\r\nThe way we're referring to the LICENSE.python sidecar file is also acceptable to Apache Legal https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-582\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds caching to any dataframes using the InteractiveRuner.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm works by modifying a DataFrame expression tree in-place. Any expressions in the tree that have a corresponding cached PCollection are replaced with PlaceHolderExpressions. These expressions are then turned into PCollections and are pruned when run with the InteractiveRunner.\r\n\r\nThis was created from https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15146.

Beam Go row coder to correctly handle schema interface providers for struct fields, map keys/values, and slice elements. Consider the following `MyStruct` and `MyParDo` and assume I have implemented a schema provider for `encoding/gob`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype MyStruct struct {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (ms *MyStruct) GobEncode() ([]byte, error) {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (ms *MyStruct) GobDecode(b []byte) error {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype MyData struct {\r\n  MyStruct MyStruct\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I encode and decode `MyData` using `beam.NewElementEncoder` and `beam.NewElementDecoder`, the result will be incorrect as Beam Go will fail to realize that `MyStruct` supports gob and ignore any unexported fields.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds caching to any dataframes using the InteractiveRuner.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm works by modifying a DataFrame expression tree in-place. Any expressions in the tree that have a corresponding cached PCollection are replaced with PlaceHolderExpressions. These expressions are then turned into PCollections and are pruned when run with the InteractiveRunner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a new common standard coder beam:coder:custom_window:v1. The coder encodes arbitrary bounded window by prefixing the max timestamp to its encoded form using the window's registered coder. e.g.:\r\n   max_timestamp\r\n   encoded_window_bytes\r\n\r\nThe idea is that, any arbitrary window extending bounded window must have max timestamp defined and runner only needs to know the max timestamp when processing trigger timers. The encoded bytes using the original custom window's registered coder can be used transparently on runner side as the identity of the window.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

option to return filename when reading files with `ReadAll` transforms. It does the same as [`ReadFromTextWithFilename`](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/2.30.0/apache_beam.io.textio.html#apache_beam.io.textio.ReadFromTextWithFilename) but works with `All` transforms (i.e., don't need be at the start of the pipeline).\r\n\r\nIt also allows other `ReadAll` transforms like `AvroIO`, `ParquetIO`, `TFRecordIO`.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind adding this feature is I have gotten use case from Beam users that needed to read files in parallel but be able to aggregate file by file after some transforms. This is not currently available and would require complex workarounds with `FileSystems`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Update BigQueryStorageStreamSource and BigQueryServicesImpl to capture API_REQUEST_COUNT metrics/errors for storage API reads\r\n\r\n- Collects all requests and errors related to API calls for Reading from BigQuery directly. i.e. the methods in BigQueryReadClient. This is done in BigQueryServicesImpl: createReadSession, readRows, splitReadStream. As well as BigQueryStorageStreamReader.readNextRecord()\r\n- Also contains a parser for BigQuery table strings formats, into TableRef. See BigQueryUtils.toTableReference. In order to populate the labels on the metric.\r\n- Adds methods to BigQuery StorageClient and StorageClientImpl so that the calls will have the bigquery table id when creating the metrics\r\n- Also contains changes to BigueryStorageSourceBase, BigQueryTableSource BigQueryQuerySource to get the tableID without trying to call the APIs to get the table. This was introduced, because when running a pipeline against a non existing table. NullPointerExceptions were thrown. With this change a proper NOT_FOUND exception is shown to the user and collected in the API_REQUEST_COUNT metrics.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
