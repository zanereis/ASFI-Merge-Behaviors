Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10087](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10087) Adds a new `UDPEventRecordSink` to support serializing Records using a configurable Record Writer, and sending serialized Records as UDP Datagram Packets.\r\n\r\nThe RecordSink implementation sends one UDP Datagram Packet per serialized Record, supporting higher transmission rates using `PutRecord` as opposed to `PutUDP` when using record-oriented flows. The `UDPEventRecordSink` leverages Netty and the existing `nifi-event-transport` module components to handle sending byte arrays to a configured UDP destination.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10088](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10088) Updates the Standard SSH Client Provider to set the SSH Client Transport Timeout using the value of the `Data Timeout` property specified in SFTP Processors. Setting the Transport Timeout overrides the internal SSHJ default timeout of 30 seconds. The default value of the `Data Timeout` property is also 30 seconds, so this change allows more customization of the SFTP connection without impacting default behavior.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10079](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10079) Upgrades ZooKeeper from 3.5.9 to 3.8.0 for framework and extension components.\r\n\r\nZooKeeper 3.5.9 is no longer supported as of 2022-06-01 according to [Apache ZooKeeper Releases](https://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html) documentation. The documentation also indicates compatibility between 3.8.0 clients and servers running 3.5 or higher:\r\n\r\n> ZooKeeper clients from 3.5.x onwards are fully compatible with 3.8.x servers.\r\nZooKeeper 3.8.x clients are compatible with 3.5.x, 3.6.x and 3.7.x servers as long as you are not using new APIs not present these versions.\r\n\r\nUpgrading to ZooKeeper 3.8.0 required adjustments to the maintain support for the embedded ZooKeeper Server, with the addition of a required connection backlog argument to `ServerCnxnFactory.configure()`. The embedded ZooKeeper 3.8.0 Server also requires `metrics-core` and `snappy-java` dependencies, which are marked as `provided` in the `zookeeper` Maven configuration, requiring direct dependency additions to `nifi-framework-core`. Previous versions included these dependencies without the `provided` scope, and existing LICENSE and NOTICE files list these dependencies.\r\n\r\nRunning the `nifi-system-test-suite` confirmed successful cluster operation with the embedded ZooKeeper 3.8.0 server. Initial testing with an external ZooKeeper 3.5.9 cluster also worked as expected.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9804](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9804) Adds support for HTTP/2 to the NiFi Jetty Application Server using a new property named `nifi.web.https.application.protocols` in the `nifi.properties` configuration.\r\n\r\nThe standard configuration uses `http/1.1` as the default value, which maintains current behavior. As described in the updated Administrator's Guide, the configuration property can be set to `h2 http/1.1` to enable Application Layer Protocol Negotiation to support either HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1 based on client capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe implementation builds on the `nifi-jetty-configuration` module and introduces a new `FrameworkServerConnectorFactory` class that configures the connector capabilities based on the `nifi.properties` configuration. This approach moves the majority of the connector configuration out of the `JettyServer` class, allowing for more focused unit testing of the connector configuration.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10075](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10075) Improves the behavior of `TestListSFTP` to reduce the possibility of intermittent failures. The `assertVerificationSuccess()` method previously ran before each test method, attempting to verify server connectivity multiple times. Changing the private method to a regular test method checks runs the check once, minimizing potential issues and allowing the `startServer` method to complete before running. Additional changes include upgrading the test to JUnit 5 and removing unnecessary exception declarations.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

That didnt make problems today for customer, but it could. It could broke project totally in some case.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9959](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9959) Adds web user interface support for Sensitive Dynamic Properties in Processors, Controller Services, and Reporting Tasks based on framework support implemented in #6057 for NIFI-9958.\r\n\r\nThe implementation applies the `SupportsSensitiveDynamicProperties` annotation to `DBCPConnectionPool` and `ScriptedReportingTask` to enable evaluation of component types in addition to `InvokeHTTP`.\r\n\r\nThe UI implementation adds a new `Sensitive Value` field to the New Property dialog with radio button selections for `Yes` and `No`. The implementation follows the same approach as the `Sensitive Value` field in Parameter definitions. The internal processing collects sensitive dynamic property names for sending to the REST API on each invocation.\r\n\r\nComponents that do not support sensitive dynamic properties will show the `No` value selected, and the radio buttons will be disabled.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X]

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9958](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9958) Adds framework support for Sensitive Dynamic Properties in Processors, Controller Services and Reporting Tasks.\r\n\r\nThe implementation adds a `SupportsSensitiveDynamicProperties` behavior annotation, which must be applied to component classes to indicate support for Sensitive Dynamic Properties. No other changes are necessary at the component implementation level.\r\n\r\nChanges include updates to REST Resource methods and models to indicate component support for sensitive dynamic properties, as well as the ability for a client to indicate names of dynamic properties that should be marked sensitive. The Property Descriptor REST Resource methods for components include an new optional `sensitive` query parameter to support subsequent user interface integration.\r\n\r\nNew system tests include basic component creation and updating with sensitive dynamic property names and values. Component auditor changes ensure the Flow Configuration History masks sensitive dynamic property values.\r\n\r\nThe flow persistence approach infers sensitive property value status based on whether the property value matches the standard encrypted pattern. This strategy avoids the need to introduce structural changes to the flow.xml.gz or flow.json.gz files.\r\n\r\nThis implementation provides the basic capabilities, and adds the `SupportsSensitiveDynamicProperties` annotation to `InvokeHTTP` for the purpose of testing REST Resource methods. Subsequent pull requests will incorporate user interface and documentation updates.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###

In case of autoload we get a FileNotFoundException with permission denied message, but during startup there is no check for that and we get a NullPointerException in the DocGenerator where NiFi attempts to use it for the first time.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to throw IOException, but those exceptions are caught which is undesirable in this situation. It can be changed later, based on the result of the below mentioned topic.\r\n\r\nDuring this task it came up that in which cases NiFi should recover during startup when it is unable to load nars to any reason. After a brief analysis it shouldn't, but it definitely needs more discussion so I've opened a new issue for it: [NIFI-10035](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10035)\r\n\r\n#

Works for PostgreSQL version 10+. Events include INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations and are output as individual flow files ordered by the time at which the operation occurred. This processor uses a Logical Replication Connection to stream data and a SQL Connection to query system views.\r\n\r\nThis new pull request builds upon the PR #5710.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10031](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10031) Downgrades Jakarta Mail from 2.0.1 to 1.2.2 in `nifi-bootstrap` to restore compatibility on Java 11 with JAXB 2 runtime dependencies on Jakarta Activation 1.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include updating assembly configuration to include Jakarta Activation libraries explicitly in the `lib/java11` directory.\r\n\r\nThese changes to `nifi-bootstrap` are necessary since NiFi includes the contents of `lib/java11` in the bootstrap class path when running on Java 11. Jakarta Mail 2 requires Jakarta Activation 2, which breaks compatibility with JAXB 2 and Jakarta Activation 1.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10032](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10032) outlines the effort involved with upgrading from JAXB 2 to JAXB 3, which will require changes across the framework.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

They are automatically passed along.\r\n\r\nSo for instance, if ListenHttp receives a file in flowfile format (sent by the PostHTTP processor). the attributes it had when leaving PostHTTP will remain with the flowfile passing through ListenHTTP as well..\r\n\r\nThis allows users to control that with new property:\r\n`FlowFile Attributes to receive as Attributes (Regex)`\r\n\r\nDefault value is set to `.*` to maintain backward compatiblity\r\n\r\nSimilar functionality already exists with the current\r\n`HTTP Headers to receive as Attributes (Regex)` attribute\r\nbut this doesn't cover the use case where incoming data is in flowfile format.\r\nso this will now cover that as well.\r\n \r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-3869](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3869) Adds configurable support the HTTP/2 protocol in the `ListenHTTP` and `HandleHttpRequest` Processors.\r\n\r\nThe implementation includes a new `nifi-jetty-configuration` module under `nifi-commons` containing a reusable `ServerConnectorFactory` and standard implementation. The configuration module includes a custom Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Processor that supports Java 8 Update 251 and later, which aligns with the current minimum required Java version for NiFi. The Jetty `http2-server` and `jetty-alpn-server` libraries are now included in the `nifi-jetty-bundle` along with all other required Jetty libraries.\r\n\r\nBoth `ListenHTTP` and `HandleHttpRequest` include a new `HTTP Protocols` property that depends on the `SSL Context Service` property. Enabling HTTP/2 requires enabling TLS, and both components default to HTTP/1.1 for both standard and TLS configurations in order to avoid unexpected changes when upgrading. The HTTP/2 protocol supports negotiating support based on client requests using ALPN, but maintaining HTTP/1.1 as the default property setting allows administrators to enable HTTP/2 support if desired. The `HTTP Protocols` property supports the following configuration options:\r\n\r\n- `http/1.1`\r\n- `h2 http/1.1`\r\n- `h2`\r\n\r\nThe property values correspond to the values defined in [RFC 7540 Section 3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.html#section-3.1) and also align with the approach used for configuring HTTP Protocols in [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#protocols). The value of `h2 http/1.1` enables the server and client to negotiate the supported version, while selecting `h2` or `http/1.1` requires the client to support the selected version.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9805](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9805) Refactors the `DistributedMapCacheServer` and `DistributedSetCacheServer` implementations using Netty instead of direct socket handling.\r\n\r\nThe implementation leverages components from `nifi-event-transport` to provide standard server configuration options and support for TLS. This approach removes a dependency on the custom `SSLSocketChannel` class in favor of the standard Netty `SslHandler` to support mututal TLS authentication.\r\n\r\nThe `StandardMapCacheServer` and `StandardSetCacheServer` classes incorporate current configuration options and provide the Netty Channel Handler pipeline necessary for processing requests and responses. Current unit tests exercise socket communication and support for TLS, so test changes are limited to upgrading from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

configurable Bulletin levels.\r\nThey used to always be at the WARN level.\r\nThey can now be set to NONE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR\r\n\r\nThis matches existing bulletin level configurability that Processors currently have.\r\n\r\nQuick tests to verify new behavior: \r\n\r\nTesting DEBUG level:\r\nUsing JettyWebSocketClient controller service - set bulletin level to DEBUG. \r\n(It requires an entry for WebSocket URI  property- for this test use a dummy uri like ws:127.0.0.1:9884).     \r\nBulletins at the debug level will start to stream from Bulletin Indicator icon at far right of status bar\r\n\r\nTest ERROR / NONE levels:\r\nUsing IPLookupService controller service\r\nuse empty file for MaxMind Database file property\r\nBulletins at ERROR level will be emitted\r\nSet Bulletin Level to NONE and restart\r\nNo bulletins will be emitted\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9990](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9990) Improves handling of FTP `550` reply codes to detect whether the reply message indicates that the file is not found or that there is a permission restriction.\r\n\r\nThe `550` reply code indicates that the remote file is unavailable, but does not indicate the specific reason. The current file not found detection is based on a specific message, and does not indicate permission problems.\r\n\r\nChanges include using a more flexible regular expression pattern to detect when a file is not found. If the reply message does not match the pattern, the `550` reply code results in a permission denied exception. Additional updates include adding unit tests to exercise these conditions.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9995](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9995) Replaces multiple custom Servlet Filters with the Spring Security `HeaderWriterFilter`, configured with Header Writers to apply the same security-related HTTP response headers.\r\n\r\nReplacing the custom filters with one filter simplifies Servlet Filter chain processing for HTTP requests and responses while maintaining the same functionality. Making the change in the `StandardRequestFilterProvider` continues to apply the headers to all applicable web applications loaded during NiFi initialization.\r\n\r\nThe standard configuration matches the current response headers and returns the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'\r\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains\r\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\r\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\r\n```\r\nThe default `HstsHeaderWriter` configuration avoids writing the `Strict-Transport-Security` header for non-HTTPS requests, so the conditional configuration check is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9988](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9988) Corrects Sensitive Property Provider decryption for encrypted property values in `authorizers.xml` and `login-identity-providers.xml`.\r\n\r\nRefactoring Sensitive Property Providers to use isolated class-loading for NIFI-9883 involved changes to the configuration classes for Authorizers and Login Identity Providers, leveraging the `ProtectionSchemeResolver` to determine the Protection Scheme based on the value of the `encryption` attribute, such as `aes/gcm/256`.\r\n\r\nThe `StandardProtectionSchemeResolver` worked with the encrypt-config command, which specifies the scheme using one of the known enumerated values, but did not work with the Authorizers or Login Identity Providers configurations, which used the path value. Updating the `StandardProtectionSchemeResolver` to support resolution based on either the Name or the Path prefix resolves the problem.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9984](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9984) Updates the `StandardOauth2AccessTokenProvider` to allow processing all 200-series HTTP responses as successful.\r\n\r\nThe update changes from checking if the response code equals to 200 to calling [Response.isSuccessful()](https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-response/is-successful/), which allows all 200-series response codes.\r\n\r\n[RFC 6749 Section 5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5.1) describes a successful response with an HTTP 200 response code, but some OAuth2 providers, such as [IBM Cloud Pak](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/dbaoc?topic=applications-using-oauth-20-based-authentication) return HTTP 201. Making adjustments to support other successful HTTP response codes enables compatibility with a wider array of OAuth2 providers.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9987](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9987) Standardizes Apache Commons IO on version 2.11.0 using dependency management in the root Maven configuration. This approach removes a number of version references and also ensures that all components rely on a version that avoids vulnerabilities associated with earlier revisions.\r\n\r\nThe majority of framework and extension components already depend on 2.10.0 or 2.11.0, so this change eliminates the need for managing direct or transitive version references in a number of modules.\r\n\r\nThe only code change required was the removal of a catch clause for `IOException` in `PutDynamoDB` where `IOUtils.toString()` no longer throws an `IOException` in Commons IO 2.11.0. As described in the Release Notes for [2.11.0](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/changes-report.html#a2.11.0), this version maintains binary compatibility with previous versions, but requires this source code change due to no longer throwing the checked exception.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9980](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-99800) Corrects conflicting dependencies for GCP Processors and Controller Services in the `nifi-gcp-bundle` and related modules.\r\n\r\nThe current configuration of the `google-cloud-bom` version `0.172.0` conflicts with the `google-cloud-core` version `2.1.7`, resulting in `NoClassDefFoundError` messages when

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9979](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9979) Removes the `nifi-druid-bundle` including `PutDruidRecord` and `DruidTranquilityService` components. The `nifi-druid-bundle` is not part of the standard binary release, and the components are based on Druid 0.9.1, which was released in June 2016. Current versions of Apache Druid support access through HTTP or JDBC, which NiFi supports through more generalized components.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps
