the Cherry Picker tool for backporting commits.\r\n\r\nThe Cherry Picker tool simplifies backporting by allowing you to apply a squashed commit to any specified branch via CLI arguments.\r\n\r\ncherry_picker {commit_sha} v2-1-test\r\n\r\nhttps://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/\r\n\r\nHere are some tests from my repository:\r\n1. All backports succeeded: https://github.com/gopidesupavan/backporting-test/pull/3\r\n2. One backport failed with conflicts, while two succeeded:https://github.com/gopidesupavan/backporting-test/pull/10\r\n\r\nAm not good at html/css 😄 so basic thing i have tried and added to backport completion message to pr comment.\r\n\r\nThe workflows operates two ways.\r\n\r\n1. When a PR is merged, if it contains any backport-to-* labels, the commit automatically backported to all the branches specified by those labels.\r\n2. Alternatively, the backport can be triggered manually by specifying the commit and the target branch.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

refactor of running providers tests and after some recent changes we need to re-sort the order of test type execution and separate out standards provider.\r\n\r\nThs \"standard\" provider has slow Venv tests and it is now the slowest provider when it comes to test suite. Similarly API test type has many more tests now and it is pretty slow. Both should be started earlier in order to make use of the parallelism we have (long running tests should go first to avoid them to stay as last ones and utilise only one processor while doing so.\r\n\r\nThis PR separates standard provider and moves both standard provider and API to the top of the list used for sorting, similarly google and amazon are put higher on the list\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

of all - thanks so much for building Airflow, it is an absolutely awesome platform! 🙌 🚀 \r\n\r\nThis PR extends the functionality of `SnowflakeHook` to make the host/port configurable for Snowflake connections. This facilitates testing against non-standard Snowflake endpoints, for example when testing against [LocalStack](https://www.localstack.cloud/localstack-for-snowflake) (a local cloud emulator).\r\n\r\nA similar PR has been created against the Astronomer Cosmos repo some time ago (see https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos/pull/1063), and our users have now requested to use the standard Airflow Snowflake connector with LocalStack Snowflake as well.\r\n\r\nThe PR also updates the documentation for the Snowflake connector, but it does not contain any tests at this point. If adding a test is required, then any pointers or guidance would be appreciated. 👍 \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested this locally against the LocalStack Snowflake emulator - with a connection config like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1009\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0977470c-234f-4cd2-8aff-736b3fc82124\">\r\n\r\n... and a simple DAG like this:\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.providers.snowflake.operators.snowflake import SnowflakeOperator\r\n\r\nconn_id = \"snowflake_local\"\r\n\r\ndag = DAG(\r\n    'snowflake_test',\r\n    default_args={'snowflake_conn_id': conn_id},\r\n    tags=['example'],\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n)\r\n\r\nsnowflake_op_sql_str = SnowflakeOperator(\r\n    task_id='query1',\r\n    dag=dag,\r\n    sql=\"SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT()\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n... the DAG executes successfully, and outputs:\r\n<img width=\"862\" alt=\"image\"

pre-commit as devel dependency is not a good idea because it might conflict with the one installed globall when you install a local venv.

function was added by not used or tested in the first PR that added the\ntask_runner code, and in the final throes of that PR we swapped from msgspec\nto pydantic, and in doing so introduced a runtime error from Pydantic as it\ntried to look at the type hints of the `task: BaseOperator` property\n\nThe fix here is to call model_construct to skip pydantic validations, which is\nsafe here as the TI (which RuntimeTI inherits from) was validated when the\nStartupDetails object was parsed+created.\n\nAnd this time add tests for the function too.\n\nIn order to test this I have created the first very simple test dag in the\nSDK and configured pytest to skip that entire directory when looking for\ntests.\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor

`wait_for_completion` was `True`\r\n- `WaitPolicy.WAIT_FOR_STEPS_COMPLETION`: New behaviour - wait for the cluster to terminate.\r\n\r\nThis is useful because it will eliminate the need to have an

Description\r\n\r\nDuring implementation of the slot handling in the Edge provider package (see https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43737) a discussion about how to enable executors to use additional information was started. This PR tackles the idea on extend the execute_async function with task_instance to allow executor consuming all the task_instance parameters. With this it is pretty simple to change a the interface and the executer can decide with task_instance parameters he wants to use to implement task specific behaviors.\r\n\r\nThis PR shows a possible solution how to tackle option 2 of discussion in this PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43737. Will also create a devlist discussion about this.\r\n\r\n# Details about changes\r\n\r\n* Add execute function into BaseExecutor which has task_instance as parameter.\r\n* New execute function calls old execute_async function to keep not updated Executors running.\r\n* Add deprecation warning for Executor which use the old execute_async

tests execution was traditionally using single \"breeze testing tests\" command and you could select which test to run via TEST_TYPE.\r\n\r\nHowever the recent move of providers and adding task_sdk necessitates splitting the tests commands into separate commands for core, providers, task_sdk, helm, integration and system.\r\n\r\nThis is done via introducing \"TEST_GROUP\" - which determines which group of tests is being executed, and dedicated testing command for each of the groups - with \"db\" and \"non-db\" variants where applicable.\r\n\r\nCleanup and small refactoring has been done to make it easier to reason about parameters passed down from the command line to docker and in-container pytest command.\r\n\r\nRelated: #42632\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software
