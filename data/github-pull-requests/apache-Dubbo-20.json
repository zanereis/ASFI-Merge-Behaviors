quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-23T03:33:06Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T00:50:19Z","closed_at":"2023-03-28T07:34:45Z","merged_at":"2023-03-28T07:34:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"b967d3c1f83265f99b1b86303ccf4899ec4ee072","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1bd1d1376c5b1f22c21529a2d03195841013749f","head":{"label":"eye-gu:binary-search-weights-11776","ref":"binary-search-weights-11776","sha":"1bd1d1376c5b1f22c21529a2d03195841013749f","user":{"login":"eye-gu","id":20450037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDUwMDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20450037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu","html_url":"https://github.com/eye-gu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":359671866,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTk2NzE4NjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"eye-gu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eye-gu","id":20450037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDUwMDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20450037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu","html_url":"https://github.com/eye-gu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eye-gu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eye-gu/dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-22T15:34:08Z","updated_at":"2023-03-28T08:43:14Z","closed_at":"2023-03-28T08:43:13Z","merged_at":"2023-03-28T08:43:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"e54494024a52a3a47de6bfc7e6c1abd4650bcf7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/92dd7f15d319d25234d205755b3dd384c8009ec5","head":{"label":"mytang0:provider-payload","ref":"provider-payload","sha":"92dd7f15d319d25234d205755b3dd384c8009ec5","user":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596634531,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4_row","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mytang0/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n#11878 \r\n\r\nRemove simplified logic for ConstraintViolationException. The reason is as follows:\r\n\r\n- I checked the historical submission records, but did not find the corresponding serialization issues to support the simplified logic.\r\n- Assuming it does cause serialization issues, it's not optimal to fix it here.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-21T13:39:39Z","updated_at":"2023-03-28T07:57:22Z","closed_at":"2023-03-28T07:57:22Z","merged_at":"2023-03-28T07:57:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"20a713faf5d093ce2ecd2ed0d562fc0213b6ec32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11881/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11881/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11881/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7a2f5de5fa1e279bdb7d104215b66547eef3e9e0","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:fix/processiong_req_end","ref":"fix/processiong_req_end","sha":"7a2f5de5fa1e279bdb7d104215b66547eef3e9e0","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-21T13:32:19Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T13:40:30Z","closed_at":"2023-03-21T13:40:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/135585e65953c7125409d40f37c704952a14309d","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:fix/procssing_end","ref":"fix/procssing_end","sha":"135585e65953c7125409d40f37c704952a14309d","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-20T10:07:43Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T08:54:33Z","closed_at":"2023-03-21T08:54:32Z","merged_at":"2023-03-21T08:54:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"6296c4401d6be323de53dc310dffeba556836d50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11872/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11872/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11872/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b5057997834b26d5ac31918ee7973884dcfc6ad9","head":{"label":"SeasonPanPan:add_java.util.x_to_serialize.allowlist","ref":"add_java.util.x_to_serialize.allowlist","sha":"b5057997834b26d5ac31918ee7973884dcfc6ad9","user":{"login":"SeasonPanPan","id":25130182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTMwMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25130182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan","html_url":"https://github.com/SeasonPanPan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610525795,"node_id":"R_kgDOJGPiYw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"SeasonPanPan/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SeasonPanPan","id":25130182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTMwMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25130182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan","html_url":"https://github.com/SeasonPanPan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SeasonPanPan/dubbo","description":"Apache

[maven-core](https://github.com/apache/maven) from 3.9.0 to 3.9.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/maven/releases\">maven-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>3.9.1</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.1/release-notes.html\">Release Notes - Maven - Version 3.9.1\n</a></h2>\n<h2>Overview About the Changes</h2>\n<p>Regression fixes from Maven 3.9.0. General performance and other fixes.</p>\n<h2>Potentially Breaking Core Changes (if migrating from 3.8.x)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Maven Resolver transport has changed from Wagon to “native HTTP”, see <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-resolver-transport.html\">Resolver Transport guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maven 2.x was auto-injecting an ancient version of plexus-utils dependency into the plugin classpath, and Maven 3.x continued doing this to preserve backward compatibility. Starting with Maven 3.9, it does not happen anymore. This change may lead to plugin breakage. The fix for affected plugin maintainers is to explicitly declare a dependency on plexus-utils. The workaround for affected plugin users is to add this dependency to plugin dependencies until issue is fixed by the affected plugin maintainer. See <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-6965\">MNG-6965</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mojos are prevented to boostrap new instance of RepositorySystem (for example by using deprecated ServiceLocator), they should reuse RepositorySystem instance provided by Maven instead. See <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7471\">MNG-7471</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each line in .mvn/maven.config is now interpreted as a single argument. That is, if the file contains multiple arguments, these must now be placed on separate lines, see <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7684\">MNG-7684</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7213\">MNG-7213</a>] - StackOverflowError when version ranges are unsolvable and graph contains a cycle</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7544\">MNG-7544</a>] - MavenMetadataSource#retrieve(MetadataResolutionRequest) does not check for null when reading from project map</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7676\">MNG-7676</a>] - On Maven 3.9.0+ release, sha512 hashes have &quot;null&quot; classifier</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7677\">MNG-7677</a>] - Maven 3.9.0 is ~10% slower than 3.8.7 in large multi-module builds</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7679\">MNG-7679</a>] - [REGRESSION] Build fails when executing a single mojo without a POM</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7685\">MNG-7685</a>] - Unable to ignore certificate errors with v3.9.0</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7693\">MNG-7693</a>] - NPE in createModelCache, modelCacheFactory is null</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7697\">MNG-7697</a>] - Cannot parse POM that contains an emoji in a comment</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7708\">MNG-7708</a>] - Resolver in Maven 3.9+ no longer retries on a conection failure</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7709\">MNG-7709</a>] - plexus-utils upgrade changes the way configuration is parsed</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7710\">MNG-7710</a>] - Upgrade plexus-utils to 3.5.1</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7716\">MNG-7716</a>] - ConcurrencyDependencyGraph deadlock if no root can be selected</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7717\">MNG-7717</a>] - Maven warns wrongly about ${localRepository} expression</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7720\">MNG-7720</a>] - [REGRESSION] Build order is incorrect and does not respect Reactor Build Order</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7721\">MNG-7721</a>] - Maven 3.9 resolver ignores proxy configured via MAVEN_OPTS</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7726\">MNG-7726</a>] - Maven 3.9.0 resolves properties in file profile activation incorrectly</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7731\">MNG-7731</a>] - MNG-7520 incorrectly back ported to Maven 3.9.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-5185\">MNG-5185</a>] - Improve &quot;missing dependency&quot; error message when _maven.repositories/_remote.repositories contains other repository ids than requested</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7686\">MNG-7686</a>] - Speed up by replacing non-pattern #replaceAll() with #replace() or precompiled patterns</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7706\">MNG-7706</a>] - Deprecate ${localRepository} mojo parameter expression</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7197\">MNG-7197</a>] - Simplify exit code handling in Windows command startup script</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[maven-plugin-api](https://github.com/apache/maven) from 3.9.0 to 3.9.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/maven/releases\">maven-plugin-api's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>3.9.1</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.1/release-notes.html\">Release Notes - Maven - Version 3.9.1\n</a></h2>\n<h2>Overview About the Changes</h2>\n<p>Regression fixes from Maven 3.9.0. General performance and other fixes.</p>\n<h2>Potentially Breaking Core Changes (if migrating from 3.8.x)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Maven Resolver transport has changed from Wagon to “native HTTP”, see <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-resolver-transport.html\">Resolver Transport guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maven 2.x was auto-injecting an ancient version of plexus-utils dependency into the plugin classpath, and Maven 3.x continued doing this to preserve backward compatibility. Starting with Maven 3.9, it does not happen anymore. This change may lead to plugin breakage. The fix for affected plugin maintainers is to explicitly declare a dependency on plexus-utils. The workaround for affected plugin users is to add this dependency to plugin dependencies until issue is fixed by the affected plugin maintainer. See <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-6965\">MNG-6965</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mojos are prevented to boostrap new instance of RepositorySystem (for example by using deprecated ServiceLocator), they should reuse RepositorySystem instance provided by Maven instead. See <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7471\">MNG-7471</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each line in .mvn/maven.config is now interpreted as a single argument. That is, if the file contains multiple arguments, these must now be placed on separate lines, see <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7684\">MNG-7684</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7213\">MNG-7213</a>] - StackOverflowError when version ranges are unsolvable and graph contains a cycle</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7544\">MNG-7544</a>] - MavenMetadataSource#retrieve(MetadataResolutionRequest) does not check for null when reading from project map</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7676\">MNG-7676</a>] - On Maven 3.9.0+ release, sha512 hashes have &quot;null&quot; classifier</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7677\">MNG-7677</a>] - Maven 3.9.0 is ~10% slower than 3.8.7 in large multi-module builds</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7679\">MNG-7679</a>] - [REGRESSION] Build fails when executing a single mojo without a POM</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7685\">MNG-7685</a>] - Unable to ignore certificate errors with v3.9.0</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7693\">MNG-7693</a>] - NPE in createModelCache, modelCacheFactory is null</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7697\">MNG-7697</a>] - Cannot parse POM that contains an emoji in a comment</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7708\">MNG-7708</a>] - Resolver in Maven 3.9+ no longer retries on a conection failure</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7709\">MNG-7709</a>] - plexus-utils upgrade changes the way configuration is parsed</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7710\">MNG-7710</a>] - Upgrade plexus-utils to 3.5.1</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7716\">MNG-7716</a>] - ConcurrencyDependencyGraph deadlock if no root can be selected</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7717\">MNG-7717</a>] - Maven warns wrongly about ${localRepository} expression</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7720\">MNG-7720</a>] - [REGRESSION] Build order is incorrect and does not respect Reactor Build Order</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7721\">MNG-7721</a>] - Maven 3.9 resolver ignores proxy configured via MAVEN_OPTS</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7726\">MNG-7726</a>] - Maven 3.9.0 resolves properties in file profile activation incorrectly</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7731\">MNG-7731</a>] - MNG-7520 incorrectly back ported to Maven 3.9.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-5185\">MNG-5185</a>] - Improve &quot;missing dependency&quot; error message when _maven.repositories/_remote.repositories contains other repository ids than requested</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7686\">MNG-7686</a>] - Speed up by replacing non-pattern #replaceAll() with #replace() or precompiled patterns</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7706\">MNG-7706</a>] - Deprecate ${localRepository} mojo parameter expression</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7197\">MNG-7197</a>] - Simplify exit code handling in Windows command startup script</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-19T14:24:20Z","updated_at":"2023-03-21T14:09:45Z","closed_at":"2023-03-21T13:29:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"638f6886b0f491545d8bf80d2143c89ebca96ecb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11865/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11865/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11865/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3bdba37529bd812e3e401506406dc440dea4d11a","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"3bdba37529bd812e3e401506406dc440dea4d11a","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-16T02:33:31Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T10:36:22Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T10:36:22Z","merged_at":"2023-03-16T10:36:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b7a735a4d44d214e618ebc2ef341d03a0ebe1eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bf4e558ab7212600064fb4010326496e6e4e4fb4","head":{"label":"mytang0:tri-compressor-config","ref":"tri-compressor-config","sha":"bf4e558ab7212600064fb4010326496e6e4e4fb4","user":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596634531,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4_row","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mytang0/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-16T02:26:33Z","updated_at":"2023-03-17T03:51:53Z","closed_at":"2023-03-17T03:51:52Z","merged_at":"2023-03-17T03:51:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"af3f75acedd9e5ca964292b2f647a2766815367d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11848/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11848/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11848/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/44da2d2b0a2b37d63be59ce5b13e20c81b80ad89","head":{"label":"mytang0:fix-ut","ref":"fix-ut","sha":"44da2d2b0a2b37d63be59ce5b13e20c81b80ad89","user":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596634531,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4_row","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mytang0/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-15T14:56:08Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T01:43:03Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T01:43:03Z","merged_at":"2023-03-16T01:43:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9bff0d6e951c3ebcbcb8e14fb3efcc2d59f1ba7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11843/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11843/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11843/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/766c6f45bc7737a6f9b2508757e0d760ba09ed6d","head":{"label":"xiaohuashengpeanut:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"766c6f45bc7737a6f9b2508757e0d760ba09ed6d","user":{"login":"xiaohuashengpeanut","id":125560790,"node_id":"U_kgDOB3vn1g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125560790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaohuashengpeanut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":614401777,"node_id":"R_kgDOJJ8G8Q","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xiaohuashengpeanut/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaohuashengpeanut","id":125560790,"node_id":"U_kgDOB3vn1g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125560790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaohuashengpeanut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaohuashengpeanut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaohuashengpeanut/dubbo","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-15T08:35:28Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T02:23:19Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T02:23:19Z","merged_at":"2023-03-16T02:23:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f6528fb86a843b2308167ffd1e5faac22e33a4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ee1baac74f9e2c09e0e282957e62fe59619fdbf7","head":{"label":"guohao:fix-deser","ref":"fix-deser","sha":"ee1baac74f9e2c09e0e282957e62fe59619fdbf7","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-15T08:14:18Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T01:42:34Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T01:42:34Z","merged_at":"2023-03-16T01:42:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0574962ecf48cf7331daf7d3ce43027300ca14e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11837/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11837/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11837/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/853d4e6b9d29048693bb8ed59d9b9f87171e8718","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/null","ref":"fix/null","sha":"853d4e6b9d29048693bb8ed59d9b9f87171e8718","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-15T05:32:13Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T06:23:59Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T06:03:44Z","merged_at":"2023-03-15T06:03:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"df0241b6dde0463517be3f5fd6968ea0a2dd9cf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11830/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11830/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11830/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d57a33f108fda28c58d2c5da6ae0a39673d490fb","head":{"label":"icodening:11760","ref":"11760","sha":"d57a33f108fda28c58d2c5da6ae0a39673d490fb","user":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460051832,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2vVeA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icodening/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icodening/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-13T07:42:17Z","updated_at":"2023-03-31T14:10:22Z","closed_at":"2023-03-13T07:44:13Z","merged_at":"2023-03-13T07:44:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d50209404cc15f5b4a37258c80327eecd713310","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/caecf2f5839a4d6c827b6ae24df98c0deb8e28a4","head":{"label":"x-shadow-man:cert_npe","ref":"cert_npe","sha":"caecf2f5839a4d6c827b6ae24df98c0deb8e28a4","user":{"login":"x-shadow-man","id":25278283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mjc4Mjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25278283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man","html_url":"https://github.com/x-shadow-man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":401980464,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDE5ODA0NjQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"x-shadow-man/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"x-shadow-man","id":25278283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mjc4Mjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25278283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man","html_url":"https://github.com/x-shadow-man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/x-shadow-man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/x-shadow-man/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-10T02:53:54Z","updated_at":"2024-10-14T10:51:53Z","closed_at":"2023-03-10T08:25:57Z","merged_at":"2023-03-10T08:25:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0a1bd014331483c19208b831c4f6b488654a508","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11780/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11780/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11780/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b862674be87e128aa908359bde7f70753191e810","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0310_fix_destroy","ref":"0310_fix_destroy","sha":"b862674be87e128aa908359bde7f70753191e810","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-08T12:03:26Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T03:17:17Z","closed_at":"2023-03-10T03:09:00Z","merged_at":"2023-03-10T03:08:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"16c61c53c6caf8ac5710f85ce7ddb2592da52dc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3bfb17dd4c040dcdcd1ecdff4e52ca70a2a5392e","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0308_metadata","ref":"0308_metadata","sha":"3bfb17dd4c040dcdcd1ecdff4e52ca70a2a5392e","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nClass BitList override the method of Object.clone(), but not implements Cloneable, maybe this is a mistake.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nAdd `implements Cloneable` of BitList.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-07T15:33:49Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T07:57:06Z","closed_at":"2023-03-10T07:18:41Z","merged_at":"2023-03-10T07:18:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"27420cf68acf9917ff982836ca3453b2616bd887","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bbecd726a48c50227c772b403b60dd1b2bcf4a3d","head":{"label":"SeasonPanPan:fixclass_implements_Cloneable","ref":"fixclass_implements_Cloneable","sha":"bbecd726a48c50227c772b403b60dd1b2bcf4a3d","user":{"login":"SeasonPanPan","id":25130182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTMwMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25130182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan","html_url":"https://github.com/SeasonPanPan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610525795,"node_id":"R_kgDOJGPiYw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"SeasonPanPan/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SeasonPanPan","id":25130182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTMwMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25130182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan","html_url":"https://github.com/SeasonPanPan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SeasonPanPan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SeasonPanPan/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n:bug: fix the disorder of aggregation indicators\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed.

(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9311\">#9311</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Ruby 3.1 support for CI and releases (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9566\">#9566</a>).</li>\n<li>Message.decode/encode: Add recursion_limit option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9218\">#9218</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9486\">#9486</a>)</li>\n<li>Allocate with xrealloc()/xfree() so message allocation is visible to the\nRuby GC.  In certain tests this leads to much lower memory usage due to more\nfrequent GC runs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9586\">#9586</a>).</li>\n<li>Fix conversion of singleton classes in Ruby (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9342\">#9342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
