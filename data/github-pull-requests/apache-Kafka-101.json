Background\r\n\r\nWhen a partition subscription is initialized it has a `null` position and is in the INITIALIZING state. Depending on the consumer, it will then transition to one of the other states. Typically a consumer will either reset the offset to earliest/latest, or it will provide an offset (with or without offset metadata). For the reset case, we still have no position to act on so fetches should not occur.\r\n\r\nRecently we made changes for KAFKA-9724 (#8376) to prevent clients from entering the AWAIT_VALIDATION state when targeting older brokers. New logic to bypass offset validation as part of this change exposed this new issue.\r\n\r\n## Bug and Fix\r\n\r\nIn the partition subscriptions, the AWAIT_RESET state was incorrectly reporting that it had a position. In some cases a position might actually exist (e.g., if we were resetting offsets during a fetch after a truncation), but in the initialization case no position had been set. We saw this issue in system tests where there is a race between the offset reset completing and the first fetch request being issued.\r\n\r\nSince AWAIT_RESET#hasPosition was incorrectly returning `true`, the new logic to bypass offset validation was transitioning the subscription to FETCHING (even though no position existed).\r\n\r\nThe fix was simply to have AWAIT_RESET#hasPosition to return `false` which should have been the case from the start. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this fix includes some guards against NPE when reading the position from the

total amount of memory per Percentiles metric is actually the sizeInBytes * number of samples, where the default number of samples is 2. There are also at least 2 Percentiles metrics per task (and more when there are multiple sources or multiple terminal nodes). So the total memory we allocate for the current e2e latency metrics is `4 * sizeInBytes * numTasks`\r\n\r\nThe current sizeInBytes we chose was 1MB. This is still not particularly large, but may add up and cause unnecessary pressure for users running on lean machines.\r\n\r\nI reduced the size to 100kB and still found it accurate enough* so we may as well reduce the size so we don't have to worry.

Split the consumer coordinator's `REBALANCING` state into `PREPARING_REBALANCE ` and `COMPLETING_REBALANCE`. The first is when the join group request is sent, and the second is after the join group response is received. During the first state we should still not send hb since it shares the same socket with the join group request and the group coordinator has disabled timeout, however when we transit to the second state we should start sending hb in case leader's `assign` takes long time. This is also for fixing KAFKA-10122.\r\n\r\n2. When deciding `coordinator#timeToNextPoll`, do not count in timeToNextHeartbeat if the state is in `UNJOINED` or `PREPARING_REBALANCE` since we would disable hb and hence its timer would not be updated.\r\n\r\n3. On the broker side, allow hb received during `PREPARING_REBALANCE`, return NONE error code instead of REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS. However on client side, we still need to ignore REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS if state is COMPLETING_REBALANCE in case it is talking to an old versioned broker.\r\n\r\n4. Piggy-backing a log4j improvement on the broker coordinator for triggering rebalance reason, as I found it a bit blurred during the investigation. Also subsumed https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9038 with log4j improvements.\r\n\r\nThe tricky part for allowing hb during `COMPLETING_REBALANCE` is in two parts: 1) before the sync-group response is received, a hb response may have reset the generation; also after the sync-group response but before the callback is triggered, a hb response can still reset the generation, we need to handle both cases by checking the generation / state. 2) with the hb thread enabled, the sync-group request may be sent by the hb thread even if the caller thread did not call `poll` yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###

PR is mainly to make StreamsPartitionAssignor more efficient in repartition count logic.\r\n\r\n**Method to be refactored:**\r\n```\r\n    private void setRepartitionTopicMetadataNumberOfPartitions(final Map<String, InternalTopicConfig> repartitionTopicMetadata,\r\n                                                               final Map<Integer,

`repartitionSourceTopics` in all the `TopicsInfo` provided. \r\nRule: \r\n1) If a topic is one of the sink topics of a TopicInfo, use the maximum of all the TopicInfo's source topic partitions as the number of partitions.\r\n2) If a topic is contained by more than one TopicInfos, use the maximum of all these TopicInfos' source topic partitions as the number of partitions.\r\nTo be more concrete, see the graph below, we will have(We use `tx` to refer to `NumOfPartition(TopicNode(\"tx\") )` for simplicity):\r\n\r\n```\r\n     t3 = max(t1,t2)\r\n     t4 = max(max(t1,t2), max(t6,t7))\r\n```\r\nIn this PR, we create the `TopicNode` to represent the topic node.\r\n\r\nThe simple example of a graph built of `TopicNode` and `TopicsInfo`\r\n```\r\n     TopicNode(\"t1\")      TopicNode(\"t2\")                       TopicNode(\"t6\")          TopicNode(\"t7\")\r\n                             \\           /                                                            \\                           /\r\n    TopicsInfo(source = (t1,t2), sink = (t3,t4))                    TopicsInfo(source = (t6,t7),sink = (t4))\r\n                                /           \\                                                                        /\r\n                             /                 \\                                                          /\r\n                          /                        \\                                           /\r\n                      /                                \\                           /\r\n                 /                                       \\            /\r\n     TopicNode(\"t3\")                      TopicNode(\"t4\")\r\n            \\\r\n     TopicsInfo(source = (t3), sink = ())\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow do we achieve it?\r\nWe can solve this by recursion with memoization.\r\n1) Build the graph constructed with `TopicNode` and `TopicsInfo`, collect all the topics that need to calculate repartition count \r\n2) For all the topics to be calculated, find the corresponding `TopicNode`, use the maximum of all its upstream `TopicsInfo` number of partitions as its number of partitions.\r\n3) For a given `TopicsInfo`, use the maximum of all its `sourceTopics` number of partitions as its number of partitions. So basically it's a mutual recursion.\r\n4) For the topics that have no upstream `TopicInfo`, it should be the ending of the recursion and we can find the partition count of these topics in the parameter `metadata`.\r\n\r\n**NB:**\r\n1) We didn't mention the memoization part in the above algo description, but we have it in the impl for efficiency.\r\n\r\n**Assumptions(my understanding, please correct me if it is not the case ):**\r\n1) There should be no cycle dependency\r\n2) All the `TopicsInfo` will have non-empty `sourceTopics`, but some `TopicsInfo` may have empty `sinkTopics`, we can deduce that the top level node in the graph must be `TopicNode`, so we can definitely terminate the recursive function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

#8270 \r\n\r\nThis change adds a check to the KafkaConfigBackingStore, KafkaOffsetBackingStore, and KafkaStatusBackingStore to use the admin client to verify that the internal topics are compacted and do not use the `delete` cleanup policy.\r\n\r\nConnect already will create the internal topics with `cleanup.policy=compact` if the topics do not yet exist when the Connect workers are started; the new topics are created always as compacted, overwriting any user-specified `cleanup.policy`. However, if the topics already exist the worker did not previously verify the internal topics were compacted, such as when a user manually creates the internal topics before starting Connect or manually changes the topic settings after the fact.\r\n\r\nThe current change helps guard against users running Connect with topics that have delete cleanup policy enabled, which will remove all connector configurations, source offsets, and connector & task statuses that are older than the retention time. This means that, for example, the configuation for a long-running connector could be deleted by the broker, and this will cause restart issues upon a subsequent rebalance or restarting of Connect worker(s).\r\n\r\nConnect behavior requires that its internal topics are compacted and not deleted after some retention time. Therefore, this additional check is simply enforcing the existing expectations, and therefore does not need a KIP.\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for the new logic, and added an integration test that verifies that the worker will fail to start if each of the three internal topics does not use only `cleanup.policy=compact`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

Incremental Cooperative Rebalancing is enabled and a worker fails to read to the end of the config topic, it needs to voluntarily revoke its locally running tasks on time, before these tasks get assigned to another worker, creating a situation where redundant tasks are running in the Connect cluster. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, instead of using the delay `worker.unsync.backoff.ms` that was defined for the eager rebalancing protocol and has a long default value (which coincidentally is equal to the default value of the rebalance delay of the incremental cooperative protocol), the worker should quickly attempt to re-read the config topic and backoff for a fraction of the rebalance delay. After this fix, the worker will retry for a maximum time of 5 times before it revokes its running assignment and for a cumulative delay less than the configured `scheduled.rebalance.max.delay.ms`.\r\n\r\nUnit tests are added to cover the backoff logic with incremental cooperative rebalancing. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-07T19:46:29Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T20:02:40Z","closed_at":"2020-06-09T20:02:35Z","merged_at":"2020-06-09T20:02:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2d37cc74e9b694713a561d307f52cc0ddf08fe6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8827/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8827/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8827/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3ff4915d9149537b46ba26738c81544de9e5a25c","head":{"label":"kkonstantine:kafka-9849","ref":"kafka-9849","sha":"3ff4915d9149537b46ba26738c81544de9e5a25c","user":{"login":"kkonstantine","id":16238634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM4NjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16238634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine","html_url":"https://github.com/kkonstantine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66110287,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjExMDI4Nw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"kkonstantine/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kkonstantine","id":16238634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM4NjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16238634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine","html_url":"https://github.com/kkonstantine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kkonstantine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kkonstantine/kafka","description":"Mirror

This is because a process translates the Properties to a Map in the Utils class which uses the underlying Hastable methods rather than the Propoerty methods.  This pull request corrects that to use the appropriate Properties methods a well as being backwards compatible for code that has been using the underlying Hashtable methods to contruct properties (there are differences due to the fact that Properties key and values must be Strings.\r\n\r\nPerformed full suite of unit test and integration tests.

patch fixes a bug in the constructor of `LogTruncationException`. We were passing the divergent offsets to the super constructor as the fetch offsets. There is no way to fix this without breaking compatibility, but the harm is probably minimal since this exception was not getting raised properly until KAFKA-9840 anyway.\r\n\r\nNote that I have also moved the check for unknown offset and epoch into `SubscriptionState`, which ensures that the partition is still awaiting validation and that the fetch offset hasn't changed. Finally, I made some minor improvements to the logging and exception messages to ensure that we always have the fetch offset and epoch as well as the divergent offset and epoch included.\r\n\r\n###

the first version of the incremental cooperative protocol, in the presence of a failed sync request by the leader, the assignor was designed to treat the unapplied assignments as lost and trigger a rebalance delay. \r\n\r\nThis commit applies optimizations in these cases to avoid the unnecessary activation of the rebalancing delay. First, if the worker that loses the sync group request or response is the leader, then it detects this failure by checking the what is the expected generation when it performs task assignments. If it's not the expected one, it resets its view of the previous assignment because it wasn't successfully applied and it doesn't represent a correct state. Furthermore, if the worker that has missed the assignment sync is an ordinary worker, then the leader is able to detect that there are lost assignments and instead of triggering a rebalance delay among the same members of the group, it treats the lost tasks as new tasks and reassigns them immediately. If the lost assignment included revocations that were not applied, the leader reapplies these revocations again. \r\n\r\nExisting unit tests and integration tests are adapted to test the proposed optimizations. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

However, after KAFKA-9184 the need appeared for the worker to revoke tasks voluntarily and proactively without having received a new assignment. \r\n\r\nThis commit will allow the worker to restart tasks that have been stopped as a result of voluntary revocation after a rebalance reassigns these tasks to the work. \r\n\r\nThe fix is tested with an integration test but we should consider adding

protocol generator generates useless conditions when a field of type string is made nullable after the request has been converted to using optional fields.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we have make the field `ProtocolName` nullable in the `JoinGroupResponse`. The `JoinGroupResponse` supports optional fields since version 6 and the field is nullable since version 7. Under these conditions, the generator generates the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (protocolName == null) {\r\n if (_version >= 7) {\r\n   if (_version >= 6) {\r\n     _writable.writeUnsignedVarint(0);\r\n   } else {\r\n     _writable.writeShort((short) -1);\r\n  }\r\n } else {\r\n   throw new NullPointerException();\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nspotbugs raises an `UC_USELESS_CONDITION` because `_version >= 6` is always true.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by propagating the outer versions to the underlying `VersionConditional` so it can generate the code accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

spotbugsPlugin to have clear error output to indicate where the error is. \r\n\r\nWhen investigating KAFKA-10081, I found the error output of spotbugs is very poor.

by @ableegoldman in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8778#discussion_r434008302, remove the unused isSticky assert out from tests only do `constrainedAssign`. I printed out the test name and which assign method used during tests. Below is the output. So, we can remove the `isSticky()` assertion from the tests using `constrainedAssign` method.\r\n\r\nIn summary, total 9 tests were doing `assertTrue(assignor.isSticky())` but using `constrainedAssign`.

The partition load time sensors for the transaction and group coordinators used the same name, so data recorded to either was stored in the same object.

failed test is because we changed the class member `partitionMovements` initialization to when the class instance created, from initialized when used within `assign` method. This won't have any issue when 1st used the `AbstractStickyAssignor` instance. But if it is used later, the `partitionMovements` will store the old info, and cause this failed tests. Fix it by moving the `partitionMovements` initialization back to `assign` method.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

the failed `testMultiConsumerStickyAssignment` by modifying the logic error in `allSubscriptionsEqual` method. \r\n\r\nWe will create the `consumerToOwnedPartitions` to keep the set of previously owned partitions encoded in the Subscription. It's our basis to do the reassignment. In the `allSubscriptionsEqual`, we'll get the member generation of the subscription, and remove all previously owned partitions as invalid if the current generation is higher. However, the logic before my fix, will remove the current highest member out of the `consumerToOwnedPartitions`, which should be kept because it's the current higher generation member. Fix this logic error.  BTW, it's a nice improvement in KAFKA-9987!\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

PR reduces allocations by using a plain old `foreach` in\r\n`matchingAcls` and improves `AclSeqs.find` to only search the inner\r\ncollections that are required to find a match (instead of searching all\r\nof them).\r\n\r\nA recent change (90bbeedf52) in `matchingAcls` to remove `filterKeys` in\r\nfavor of filtering inside `flatMap` caused a performance regression in\r\ncases where there are large number of topics, prefix ACLs and\r\nTreeMap.from/to filtering is ineffective. In such cases, we rely on\r\nstring comparisons to exclude entries from the ACL cache that are not\r\nrelevant.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not present in any release yet, so we should include the\r\nsimple fix in the 2.6 branch.\r\n\r\nThe original benchmark did not show a performance difference, so I\r\nadjusted the benchmark to stress the relevant code more. More\r\nspecifically, `aclCacheSnapshot.from(...).to(...)` returns nearly 20000\r\nentries where each map value contains 1000 AclEntries. Out of the 200k\r\nAclEntries, only 1050 are retained due to the `startsWith` filtering.\r\n\r\nThis is the case where the implementation in master is least\r\nefficient when compared to the previous version and the version in this\r\nPR.\r\n\r\nThe adjusted benchmark results for testAuthorizer are 4.532ms for\r\nmaster, 2.903ms for the previous version and 2.877ms for this PR.\r\nNormalized allocation rate was 593 KB/op for master, 597 KB/op for the\r\nprevious version and 101 KB/s for this PR.

6.5 includes a fix for https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/12866, which\r\naffects the performance of Scala compilation.\r\n\r\nI profiled the scalac build with async profiler and 54% of the time was on GC\r\neven after the Gradle upgrade (it was more than 60% before), so I switched to\r\nthe throughput GC (GC latency is less important for batch builds) and it\r\nwas reduced to 38%.\r\n\r\nI also centralized the jvm configuration in `build.gradle` and simplified it a bit\r\nby removing the minHeapSize configuration from the test tasks.\r\n\r\nOn my desktop, the time to execute clean builds with no cached Gradle daemon\r\nwas reduced from 127 seconds to 97 seconds. With a cached daemon, it was\r\nreduced from 120 seconds to 88 seconds. The performance regression when\r\nwe upgraded to Gradle 6.x was 27 seconds with a cached daemon \r\n(https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7677#issuecomment-616271179), so it\r\nshould be fixed
