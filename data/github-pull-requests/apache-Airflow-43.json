investigating a user comment, I noticed that the Kuberneters Pod Manager uses a lot of hardcoded sleep loops.  I'm not sure if this will fix their issue, but it seems like a worthwhile update.\r\n\r\nContext\r\n---\r\n\r\nA user shared some logs and resource usage graphs which seem to indicate very high CPU usage spikes while waiting for kubernetes pods to start.  I traced the code back to find a few different `while true: if resource_not_ready: sleep()` style blocks and it seems that changing those to a capped exponential backoff may be at least part of the solution for those spikes.\r\n\r\nEven if it isn't at least part of the solution to the CPU spikes, maybe it's still a worthwhile update to the code?  I'm not sure.   My main issue is I'm not really sure how to benchmark this.  It seems logical that it would help some, but I can't think of a repeatable way to see how much it's helping, if at all.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n---\r\nExisting unit tests and static checks are passing

Custom Operator to trigger the Power BI Dataset refresh. \r\n\r\n## Operators\r\n### PowerBIDatasetRefreshOperator\r\nThe operator triggers the Power BI dataset refresh and pushes the details of refresh in Xcom. It can accept the following parameters:\r\n\r\n* `dataset_id`: The dataset Id.\r\n* `group_id`: The workspace Id.\r\n* `wait_for_termination`: (Default value: True) Wait until the pre-existing or current triggered refresh completes before exiting.\r\n* `force_refresh`: When enabled, it will force refresh the dataset again, after pre-existing ongoing refresh request is terminated.\r\n* `timeout`: Time in seconds to wait for a dataset to reach a terminal status for non-asynchronous waits. Used only if ``wait_for_termination`` is True.\r\n* `check_interval`: Number of seconds to wait before rechecking the refresh status.\r\n\r\n## Hooks\r\n### PowerBI Hook\r\nA hook to interact with Power BI.\r\n* `powerbi_conn_id`: Airflow Connection ID that contains the connection information for the Power BI account used for authentication.\r\n\r\n## Custom Connection form\r\n### Connection type: Power BI\r\nYou need to store following credentials:\r\n* `client_id`: The Client ID of your service principal.\r\n* `client_secret`: The Client Secret of your service principal.\r\n* `tenant_id`: The Tenant Id of your service principal.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* #### Xcom Integration: The Power BI Dataset refresh operator enriches the Xcom with essential fields for downstream tasks:\r\n1. `powerbi_dataset_refresh_id`: Request Id of the Dataset Refresh.\r\n2. `powerbi_dataset_refresh_status`: Refresh Status.\r\n    * `In Progress`: Refresh state is unknown or a refresh is in progress.\r\n    * `Completed`: Refresh successfully completed.\r\n    * `Failed`: Refresh failed (details in `powerbi_dataset_refresh_error`).\r\n    * `Disabled`: Refresh is disabled by a selective refresh.\r\n3. `powerbi_dataset_refresh_end_time`: The end date and time of the refresh (may be None if a refresh is in progress)\r\n4. `powerbi_dataset_refresh_error`: Failure error code in JSON format (None if no error)\r\n\r\n* #### External Monitoring link: The operator conveniently provides a redirect link to the Power BI UI for monitoring refreshes.\r\n\r\n## Sample DAG to use the plugin.\r\n\r\nCheck out the sample DAG code below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom operators.powerbi_refresh_dataset_operator import PowerBIDatasetRefreshOperator\r\n\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n        dag_id='refresh_dataset_powerbi',\r\n        schedule_interval=None,\r\n        start_date=datetime(2023, 8, 7),\r\n        catchup=False,\r\n        concurrency=20,\r\n        tags=['powerbi', 'dataset', 'refresh']\r\n) as dag:\r\n\r\n    refresh_in_given_workspace = PowerBIDatasetRefreshOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"refresh_in_given_workspace\",\r\n        dataset_id=\"<dataset_id\",\r\n        group_id=\"workspace_id\",\r\n        force_refresh = False,\r\n        wait_for_termination = False\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    refresh_in_given_workspace\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

this PR for running CI tests. Changes are as follows : \r\n\r\n* import path changed\r\n* db renamed to client\r\n* encode method changed to dumps\r\n* decode method changed to loads\r\n* flask-session creates session table by default so migration is removed to avoid duplicate table error.\r\n\r\nIssues :\r\n \r\n* serialization tests fail since flask_session switched to msgpack by default from pickle which causes objects that were compatible with pickle like flask's flash message objects to fail in the test since msgpack doesn't know how to serialize them.\r\n* It seems after the release of 0.8.0 the methods encode/decode were again changed to dumps/loads in https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-session/commit/0c22ec67b4ccfd210f2ac94a70b39e6d46497d5b . This will cause an issue moving to 0.8.0+ since there is no compatibility layer between two methods.\r\n\r\ncloses: #36897\r\nrelated: #36897

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: [#40297](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40297)\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNow I fully understand why we had a \"concurrency\" issue with the XCom's when using the MSGraphAsyncOperator which has a paged result with a dynamic task mapping.\r\n\r\nThe issue is not a concurrency issue at all, but rather a misusage of the Xcoms when handling paged results within dynamic mapped tasks.\r\n\r\nYou have to be aware that when the MSGraphAsyncOperator detects that the result will be composed of multiple pages, it will append the consequent pages to the already fetched ones within the current XCom.\r\nThis worked fine until we start using is with the partial and expand functionally, e.g. applying dynamic task mapping on the MSGraphAsyncOperator.\r\n\r\nThis issue there was that we didn't take into account the map_index of the TaskInstance, and by default when you use the xcom_pull method of the BaseOperator, it will automatically used all available map_indices to retrieve the XCom, and thus return all fetched page results for all mapped tasks, which is wrong in this case as we need to only append the paged result to the already existing one for the current task instance in which it is being run and NOT to all the xcoms, which is the default behaviour when you do a xcom_pull.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the xcom_pull method of the BaseOperator doesn't allow you to specify the map_index, so it taks all indices by default.  So in order to fix that, I need to call the xcom_pull method directly on the TaskInstance from the context, as there the method allows you to specifiy map_index, which solves then our problem but has nothing to do with concurrency.\r\n\r\nI think it would be good to adapt the xcom_pull method of the BaseOperator so it can also take into account the map_index if needed (and also add default while we're at it), but leave it to None as it's done in the TaskInstance.\r\nOf course to be able to used it, the provider will need at least the version of Airflow that has that new implementation. In the meantime I do it directly on the TaskInstance but I think it's a good idea to still adapt the method on BaseOperator,\r\nespecially once Airflow 3 will be there, the code will be cleaner.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    @provide_session\r\n    def xcom_pull(\r\n        self,\r\n        task_ids: str | Iterable[str] | None = None,\r\n        dag_id: str | None = None,\r\n        key: str = XCOM_RETURN_KEY,\r\n        include_prior_dates: bool = False,\r\n        session: Session = NEW_SESSION,\r\n        *,\r\n        map_indexes: int | Iterable[int] | None = None,  # add those 2 extra params like in TaskInstance\r\n        default: Any = None,  # add those 2 extra params like in TaskInstance\r\n    ) -> Any:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Pull XComs that optionally meet certain criteria.\r\n\r\n        The default value for `key` limits the search to XComs\r\n        that were returned by other tasks (as opposed to those that were pushed\r\n        manually). To remove this filter, pass key=None (or any desired value).\r\n\r\n        If a single task_id string is provided, the result is the value of the\r\n        most recent matching XCom from that task_id.

Description\r\n#### As mentioned in #17447:\r\nCurrently it is not possible to avoid the default Helm annotations on resources such as ```extraConfigMaps``` and ```extraSecrets``` and there's no way in ArgoCD to override / ignore those default hooks.\r\n\r\nThis issue might be related to ArgoCD’s behavior, though it is not certain, but it can result in pods entering ```CreateContainerConfigError``` state during updates like when the scheduler is trying to boot up new tasks or when new Airflow pods are created that depend on extra secrets / configMaps, which the hooks have just deleted.\r\n\r\n### Solution:\r\nThe fix in this PR takes after the same approach and conventions used in PR #18776 for the ```migrateDatabaseJob``` and ```createUserJob``` resources by using ```useHelmHooks``` flag to decide whether or not to add the Helm hooks annotations.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Support disabling helm hooks by setting ```useHelmHooks=false``` (by default the annotations are added)\r\n- Add helm tests\r\n- Update Airflow Helm documentation \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license

run over and over even when no changes have happened that would allow it to pass. This causes the scheduler loop to get slower and slower as more blocked TIs pile up.\r\n\r\nThis scenario is easy to reproduce with this DAG (courtesy of @rob-1126): Before running it, enable debug logging\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator\r\n\r\nclass FailsFirstTimeOperator(BashOperator):\r\n    def execute(self, context):\r\n        if context[\"ti\"].try_number == 1:\r\n            raise Exception(\"I fail the first time on purpose to test retry delay\")\r\n        print(context[\"ti\"].try_number)\r\n        return super().execute(context)\r\n\r\none_day_of_seconds = 60 * 60 * 24\r\nwith DAG(dag_id=\"waity\", schedule_interval=None, start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1)):\r\n    starting_task = FailsFirstTimeOperator(task_id=\"starting_task\", retry_delay=one_day_of_seconds, retries=1, bash_command=\"echo whee\")\r\n    for i in range(0,1*1000):\r\n        task = BashOperator(task_id=f\"task_{i}\", bash_command=\"sleep 1\")\r\n        starting_task >> task\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimply run multiples of the above DAG (6 dagruns is enough to observe the delay). Note that the scheduler loop is now taking ~4-6 seconds, and grows with each new waity dagrun.\r\n\r\nThe solution was to change the last_scheduling_decision to next_schedulable date for the dagrun.\r\n1. When the task instance enter up_for_retry state, we set the next_schedulable date for the dagrun to the next retry date of the ti. This way, we stop unnecessary dependency checks for other TIs blocked by this retry state.\r\n2.

Since the classifier requires a minimum of 10 documents for training for each label. I've observed that it takes a maximum of 10 to 15 minutes to train the classifier, given the limited number of labels and documents. This is the minimum setup I was able to get running, so it can be executed in the daily system test suite.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1220\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/31437079/11d9cabf-66c9-4f49-99e7-2dc4b5fdb2d4\">\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

finalization is run generally when all tests succeded in canary run. What the finalization does is:\r\n\r\n* updating constrainst\r\n* pushing them\r\n* updating image cache\r\n* summarizing warnings\r\n\r\nHowever special tests are really to test some special cases - back compatibility, lowest dependencies, latest boto etc. All those tests will only be run in a few selected PRs where we upgrade dependencies and they will not affect \"regular\" PRs, so we can safely update the constraints and update the cache without waiting for special tests.\r\n\r\nThis will increase the frequency of updates to constraints - because now they might be quite delayed in case some special tests fail, but this is unnecessary holding the constraints update.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

to #39496 and the aftermath of it.\r\nIn that PR tests for served logs were added for other instance states than `TaskInstanceState.RUNNING`, including `TaskInstanceState.UP_FOR_RETRY` (added in the PR) and `TaskInstanceState.DEFERRED` (not added in the PR).\r\n\r\nHowever, as it was briefly discussed in the PR and was later [discovered](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39496#issuecomment-2149692239), the current testing setup does not seem to guarantee consistent behavior for  `TaskInstanceState.DEFERRED`, as the tests succeed in local, but fail in the CI.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the testing of the state `TaskInstanceState.DEFERRED`, as it was not the main purpose of #39496 but was rather an attempt to add better testing coverage for old behavior cases as well.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR is a DRAFT to further discuss technical details on AIP-69 direction. DO NOT MERGE - but please feedback on it.\r\n\r\nPlease treat this as a PoC, it is only partly working. It can be used to distribute the first task but a lot of core required functions to make a MVP are missing. Status of implementation is tracked in `airflow/providers/remote/TODO.md` in this PR.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test it you can:\r\n- Checkout the branch\r\n- Run `breeze start-airflow --python 3.12 --load-example-dags --backend postgres --executor RemoteExecutor --answer y`\r\n- Start the Remote executor with `airflow/providers/remote/_start_remote_worker.sh`\r\n- A (non templated, not mapped, non failing) task can be run, e.g. use example DAG `example_python_operator`. Wohoo! \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/c0e148d7-8712-43d4-b927-958d1fd578ad)\r\n- If you open the UI you will see an additional plugin loaded in the menu \"Admin\" -> \"Remote Worker Status\": \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/a7a6ae19-f962-44db-a8c7-cf913a7edbeb)\r\n\r\nBased on progress and time I will sometimes rebase and push changes to this branch. But it will not be something that will be review-able.\r\nI will not add any migration logic in case of updates for the additional tables in DB Scheme. If I update the draft PR and DB schema changes, DB might need to be reset. Of course migration support would need to be added before a \"real\" release.","created_at":"2024-06-13T21:30:55Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T04:47:22Z","closed_at":"2024-10-11T04:47:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35986, `RedshiftToS3Operator` began wrapping `select_query` in `$$` to handle single quotes. Escaped single quotes (`''`) are un-escaped using regex replacement for backwards compatibilty. The regex is greedy, however, and lines containing multiple strings inside of escaped single quotes only have the outermost quotes un-escaped.\r\n\r\nA query such as:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE name IN (''foo'', ''bar'')\r\n```\r\nis modified to:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE name IN ('foo'', ''bar')\r\n```\r\nIn this example, the operator succeeds but the results are unexpected.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the regex pattern to match as few characters as possible, and adds test coverage for this case.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

allows testing a DAG locally. [See documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/debug.html#testing-dags-with-dag-test). `Dag.test()` uses no scheduler and no executor to run the task. It runs just all the task instances of the DAG in the current process.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends `Dag.test()` functionality to add capability of testing a DAG with an executor. If a different executor than `LocalExecutor` is configured in config, then it will use this executor to run the DAG. By default, `pytest` erases all environment variables before executing tests, thus I introduced a new flag to disable this behavior if desired: `--keep-env-variables`.\r\n\r\nFor example, the command below executes successfully the system test `tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_sns.py` with a different executor than `LocalExecutor`. Here my Airflow environment was configured to use `AwsEcsExecutor` but it could have been another one.\r\n\r\n`breeze testing tests tests/system/providers/amazon/aws/example_sns.py --system amazon --keep-env-variables --test-type System --forward-credentials --test-timeout 500`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
