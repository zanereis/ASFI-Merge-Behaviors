PR is another \"eye candy\" for upcoming 2.9.0 release - and I hope I pass the review and merge if before release cut-off.\r\n\r\nLogging is usually a mass of text. Tasks/Operators generate a lot of text and it is hard to read and understand what is going on. Expertise need to be built-up. In our departments users are mostly over-whelmed with the logs in Airflow.\r\n\r\nA bit of filtering had been introduced but what I personally always was missing was a kind of log grouping which is existing in [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#grouping-log-lines) or also [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/scripts/logging-commands?view=azure-devops&tabs=powershell#formatting-commands).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Log Grouping also to Airflow with the following effects:\r\n- Log grouping can be made with the same keywords like in Github or AzureDevOps - means that if users have scripts from these systems, they could be used in Airflow as well. Start a group with `::group::Some Headline` and end it with `::endgroup::`\r\n- Task instance runs automatically \"fold\" log details of task execution prior and post `execute()` method, making logs clean per default (showing only real business logic)\r\n- If a user un-folds a section, un-folding state is remembered in Grid view\r\n- Grouping is also working in old/legacy log view as well as Grid if the log is updated (auto-tail when task is running)\r\n\r\nExample, how do logs look like for the `example_params_trigger_ui` DAG:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/5718a2d1-70e6-4316-83bb-1c0ab104f47a)\r\n\r\nIf you click on the blue colored log group header, the section

Don't allow a default parameter other than None for context parameters, since this is always replaced by None in 2.8. Keeping this behavior allowed would only bring confusion as it's ambiguous. Suggested by @potiuk in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38007#pullrequestreview-1926201627.\r\n2. Improve the error message for cases where the replacement of default values breaks the function signature.

PR aim to fix a bug in the GlueJobHook that occurs when setting the `verbose` parameter of GlueJobOperator to True.\r\nThe `print_job_logs` method is instantiating a new boto3 client instead of using an AwsLogsHook.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/hooks/glue.py#L228\r\n\r\nIf the `GlueJobOperator` is instantiated with an Airflow Connection with a `role_arn` different than the one used by the Airflow Workers, it result in a `AccessDeniedException` (because the boto3 client is using the default credentials)\r\n\r\nTo fix this bug I've deleted the boto3 client instantiated in the `print_job_logs` method and instead, created a new `AwsLogsHook` using the `aws_conn_id` attribute.\r\n\r\nClose

[discussion](https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/29302)\r\n\r\nWhen DockerOperator logs are displayed in the Airflow UI, the logs from the container are prefixed with \"[asctime UTC] {docker.py:[line]} INFO -\" in some \"random\" lines. This prefix can disrupt the logging format inside the container and is often redundant:\r\n\r\n- [asctime UTC]: This timestamp may duplicate timestamps already present in the container logs\r\n-

reverts commit 39befdce1205decb871fea86379b427cfc7106bc.\r\n\r\nSomething in this commit broke a bunch of other system tests.  It looks like every AWS system test which gets a value from SSM stopped working once this was merged.  Since I'm not sure what else may be affected, and it's the end of the day on a Friday, I want to revert this commit and we can have a look at it on Monday to pinpoint the problem.\r\n\r\nSystem Test Dashboard is [here](https://aws-mwaa.github.io/#/open-source/system-tests/dashboard.html) to see the blast radius, timing, and hopefully the fix.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nRan the tests and they failed, reverted this commit, rebuild ci-image, re-ran a couple of the tests again and the ones I ran all passed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR adds a new operator to the dbt provider `DbtCloudRetryJobOperator`. This operator calls DBT cloud API for retrying a job from point of failure.\r\n\r\nNote after making the retrying call, the behavior of this operator is very similar to the `DbtCloudRunJobOperator` to poll the job status, hence it references the same operator link `DbtCloudRunJobOperatorLink` and the openlineage code is also the same. \r\n\r\nAlso makes a minor fix for `DbtCloudRunJobOperator` and related docs. \r\n\r\nTested locally with example DBT dag \r\n<img width=\"1200\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-08 at 9 23 15 AM\"

This PR adds `fallback` to `conf.get` where missing. This PR has been released in `apache-airflow-providers-openlineage=1.7.0`.\r\n\r\nSymptom you can see is only getting OpenLineage DAG start events, as when a task level event is trying to be sent, the above errors are raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n1. If possible, install `apache-airflow-providers-openlineage>=1.7.0`.\r\n2.

User who do not wish to use Airflow's core otel feature, or having Airflow version that does NOT have the otel feature available can use the provider package to send user specific metrics and traces.\r\n\r\nThe provider package also comes with listener plugin that will, when configured, automatically emit traces on DAG runs and TaskInstance runs. You can also combine the user-generated spans as part of the DAG run, giving users a complete control over how they would like to generate OpenTelemetry data while running DAGs.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-08T05:14:03Z","updated_at":"2024-08-15T19:31:50Z","closed_at":"2024-07-22T16:13:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d35e3a5345bc49fd5eb7a7e733d0d6abd8daaf1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"josh-fell","id":48934154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTM0MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48934154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell","html_url":"https://github.com/josh-fell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josh-fell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/37989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/37989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}

PR addresses a bug in the ECS Executor where the executor did not attempt all queued tasks in one `sync` cycle if a task failed. This PR fixes the behaviour, and the ECS Executor now attempts all queued tasks exactly once per iteration, regardless of the state of the task. If a task fails to run (i.e. some `Exception` is thrown when calling `run_task`), it gets put back on the queued tasks list, and gets attempted in the next `sync` iteration. This continues until the maximum number of attempts for a task has been reached. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

data shows that wait_for_crawl usually takes around 180s with spikes up to 360 seconds.

There is no need for the test to run for 1 hour if it is doomed to fail.\r\n\r\nAdding a timeout of 500 seconds should give plenty of buffer for success cases while stopping failure cases from running excessively long.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Unfortunately, Airbyte [currently supports two different APIs](https://docs.airbyte.com/api-documentation): \r\n1. The [Config API](https://airbyte-public-api-docs.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rapidoc-api-docs.html) is for OSS Airbyte users self-hosting Airbyte. \r\n2. The [Cloud API](https://reference.airbyte.com/reference/start) is for Airbyte Cloud users.\r\n\r\nSome noteable differences:\r\n- Authentication to the Config API is done via user:password basic auth while the Cloud API takes an API Token\r\n- Endpoint payloads are similar, but not identical\r\n- API Call methods are different (i.e., some `POST` requests in the config api are `GET` requests in the cloud API)\r\n\r\nTo get around this, I'm suggesting we provide users the ability to specify `api_type=\"cloud\"` on the operator/hook parameters. The default setting is `config` so that functionality doesn't break for existing users.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-06T17:53:16Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T05:02:59Z","closed_at":"2024-03-06T19:48:41Z","merged_at":"2024-03-06T19:48:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"25fd66c4b48fd940b11b09d3b590ab9d002cda11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5787812864,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABWPsEAA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:airbyte","name":"provider:airbyte","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/37943/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/37943/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/37943/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c4c4ac6b503ed6d3c017f303308def8fa8a6eae6","head":{"label":"chrishronek:airbyte-api","ref":"airbyte-api","sha":"c4c4ac6b503ed6d3c017f303308def8fa8a6eae6","user":{"login":"chrishronek","id":31361051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzYxMDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31361051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek","html_url":"https://github.com/chrishronek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":743020401,"node_id":"R_kgDOLEmXcQ","name":"airflow","full_name":"chrishronek/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chrishronek","id":31361051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzYxMDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31361051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek","html_url":"https://github.com/chrishronek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrishronek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chrishronek/airflow","description":"Apache

Maybe the check will be to restrictive, so I hope we will see the effect of this in the integration tests as the check is disabled when running unit tests, otherwise the execute method of an operator would never be able to run.  I've added 2 unit tests, one case where it's being called directly and thus fails and another one where it's indirectly being called from a TaskInstance.\r\n\r\nAny remarks are welcome.\r\n---\r\n**^

While it makes sense that `delegate_to` has been deprecated in favour of `impersonation_chain` for the Google Cloud Hooks, I suspect this was removed in error from GoogleDriveHooks in Transfer Operators that also include Google Cloud Hooks. Google Drive Hooks and Transfer Operators that do not involve Google Cloud still supports the `delegate_to` parameter, so it make sense that the Transfer operators copying from Google Cloud into Google Drive do as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following changes:\r\n- Adds delegate_to as constructor arguments and instance variables for GCSToGoogleDrive and GCSToGoogleSheets Transfer operators.\r\n- Adds appropriate unittest coverage.\r\n- Updates inline documentation for these classes to explicitly note that the `delegate_to` argument only applies to the GoogleDrive

PR updates SnowflakeSqlApiHook to support [OAuth](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/sql-api/authenticating#using-oauth).\r\n\r\nIn order to update this hook have to update the `SnowflakeHook` to parse the refresh token and client credentials.\r\n\r\nThe OAuth workflow assumes the user already obtained the `refresh_token`, `client_id`, and `client_secret`. In particular the `refresh_token` should be obtained outside of airflow. \r\n\r\nThe PR also fixes the snowflake `account_identifier` used in the hook which used to force a region, but region should be [optional](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier) in the identifier. \r\n\r\nAlso tested locally by running the `SnowflakeSqlApiOperator` operator in example

small adjustments were needed to make this run for our dashboard.\r\n\r\n- System Tests should be self-contained; rather than accepting a cluster-id passed in, the test now creates and tears down the cluster\r\n- Only one of our system tests uses `pendulum.datetime`, the rest all use `datetime.datetime`\r\n- Trivial adjustments to the DAG parameters to match the other tests (added an \"example\" tag and set the same start date) \r\n- Our system test runners do not yet support deferrable mode, removed that for now\r\n\r\nLocal run results:

of the operators in Apache Beam had side effect that they modified detault options passed to it in constructor, and in case of xdist tests it had side effect that they could impact other test results (this happened recently in main). The default options are already set by the Dataflow mixin in execute method in all Beam operators, but in Python and Go operator the defaults are also set in the constructor.\r\n\r\nSetting the defaults in mixin uses deepcopy to avoid such side effects.\r\n\r\nThis might  be intended, so this PR rather than removing default settings in the constructor, also adds deepcopy in them and fixes resulting tests - removing the defaults in tests that do not have the defaults set in the constructor.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

testing auth managers I realized that `is_authorized_custom_view` is also called when custom pages are defined in plugins. Therefore, we need to make the method `BaseAuthManager.is_authorized_custom_view` abstract so that auth managers can also work in environments with custom pages defined in plugins.\r\n\r\nThis is technically a breaking change but:\r\n- Auth managers have been introduced recently, I am very confident nobody used the interface yet\r\n- Documentation related to auth managers have not been released yet (will be in 2.9), hence the likelihood of having user using the interface is even less\r\n- This is a bug fix\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR is a WIP proposal to fix/resolve the request for feature #37810 \r\n\r\nNOTE: It is just a code preview, therefore WIP.\r\n\r\nIdea:\r\n- Use XCom / task result as `extra` (if not provided in Dataset reference)\r\n  - If dataset defines `extra` use this as params\r\n  - If task returns a dict, pass this as params\r\n  - If task does not return a dict, provide the task name as key, return as value\r\n- Pass the `extra` to the data triggered DAG as `params`\r\n  - If multiple events trigger a DAG, params are merged\r\n\r\nOpen items:\r\n- Agree on \"this is a good idea\"\r\n-
