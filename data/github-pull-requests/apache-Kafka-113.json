describes a case where fetch sessions appear to be prematurely evicted from the FetchSessionCache causing frequent `FETCH_SESSION_ID_NOT_FOUND` errors and fetch session restarts.\r\n\r\nI believe the handling in `kafka.server.FetchSession` is incorrect in two ways. Firstly it only touches the cache entry if the number of partitions changed between fetches. This means that a fetch session that is in steady state will not have its last used time updated. The second problem is that it supplies the current lastUsedMs as the current time when updating lastUsedMs for the session. As a result, even when the cache entry is touched, the time is not updated. Overall I believe this means that every entry's lastUsedMs will be the time it was created. When the fetch session becomes full, the oldest entry will be evicted, not the least recently used entry. Note that this also breaks the privileged session semantics as recently used ReplicaFetcher sessions will be considered to have been lost as they will not be considered used for longer than `MIN_INCREMENTAL_FETCH_SESSION_EVICTION_MS`.\r\n\r\nThe cache itself is currently tested reasonably well, but the interaction between FetchSession and FetchSessionCache is not currently tested. I have added a new test that tests the integration point between FetchSession and FetchSessionCache by adding new sessions and incrementally fetching them to check whether the right session is evicted.","created_at":"2019-11-04T16:45:38Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T01:27:51Z","closed_at":"2019-11-06T01:27:51Z","merged_at":"2019-11-06T01:27:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4cbdc6a7b3140ccbcd0e2339e28c048b434974e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/02f9ddcd13096bde2f373db489a1fbfb34617380","head":{"label":"lbradstreet:KAFKA-9137","ref":"KAFKA-9137","sha":"02f9ddcd13096bde2f373db489a1fbfb34617380","user":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154184520,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQxODQ1MjA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"lbradstreet/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet/kafka","description":"Mirror

follow up to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7608:\r\nFor some reason the `AssignedStreamTasks#updateRestored` method only updates the `restoring` and `restoredPartitions` data structures, but there is a third map holding restored tasks & partitions: `restoringByPartitions` -- this was causing failures during `onPartitionsLost` due to the new strict emptiness checks introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7608)\r\n\r\nAlso fixes a strict emptiness check based on a faulty assumption (introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7608) , as the `partitionInfo` in `StoreChangelogReader` is just the latest metadata for all topics and does not need to be, and shouldn't be, empty.\r\n\r\nAlso improves the `TaskManager#closeLostTasks` logging, by separating by case and logging the specific failure before throwing.\r\n\r\nNeeds to be cherry-picked to 2.4 as well","created_at":"2019-11-01T01:49:00Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T01:08:19Z","closed_at":"2019-11-02T17:22:37Z","merged_at":"2019-11-02T17:22:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b905ade0cdc7a5f6f746727ecfe4e7a7463a200","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/be1994fa4dd51c67bdb8e964d40699bedf770f30","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:HOTFIX-AssignedTasks-isEmpty-runningByPartition","ref":"HOTFIX-AssignedTasks-isEmpty-runningByPartition","sha":"be1994fa4dd51c67bdb8e964d40699bedf770f30","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

Background:\r\nCurrently, whenever a batch is dropped because of`InvalidRecordException` or `InvalidTimestampException`, only the culprit record appears in `ProduceResponse.PartitionResponse.recordErrors`. However, after users try to resend that batch excluding the rejected message, the latter records are not guaranteed to be free of problems.\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\nTo address this issue, I changed the function signature of `validateKey`, `validateRecord` and `validateTimestamp` to return a Scala's `Option` object. Specifically, this object will hold the reason/message the current record in iteration fails and leaves to the callers (`convertAndAssignOffsetsNonCompressed`, `assignOffsetsNonCompressed`, `validateMessagesAndAssignOffsetsCompressed`) to gathered all troubling records into one place. Then, all these records will be returned along with the `PartitionResponse` object. As a result, if a batch contains more than one record errors, users see exactly which records cause the failure. `PartitionResponse.recordErrors` is a list of `RecordError` objects introduced by #7167 which include `batchIndex` denoting the relative position of a record in a batch and `message` indicating the reason of failure.\r\n\r\n## Gotchas:\r\nThings are particularly tricky when a batch has records rejected because of both `InvalidRecordException` and `InvalidTimestampException`. In this case, the `InvalidTimestampException` takes higher precedence. Therefore, the `Error` field in `PartitionResponse` will be encoded with `INVALID_TIMESTAMP`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

bugfix for the failing broker bounce system test with cooperative rebalancing:\r\n\r\n**tl;dr** We need to remove everything associated with a task when it is closed, but in some cases (eg `AssignedTasks#commit`) on a `TaskMigratedException` we would close it as a zombie and then (only) remove the taskId from the `running` map. This left  its partitions, restorers, state stores, etc around and in an undefined state, causing exceptions when closing and/or opening the stores again.\r\n\r\n**Longer explanation:**\r\nIn AssignedTasks (the abstract class from which the standby and active task variations extend) a commit failure (even due to broker down/unavailable) is treated as a TaskMigratedException after which the failed task is closed as a zombie and removed from running -- the remaining tasks (ie those still in running are then also closed as zombies in the subsequent onPartitionsLost\r\n\r\nHowever we do not remove the closed task from runningByPartition nor do we remove the corresponding changelogs, if restoring, from the StoreChangelogReader since that applies only to active tasks, and AssignedTasks is generic/abstract. The changelog reader then retains a mapping from the closed task's changelog partition to its CompositeRestoreListener (and does not replace this when the new one comes along after the rebalance). The restore listener has a reference to a specific RocksDBStore instance, one which was closed when the task was closed as a zombie, so it accidentally tries to restore to the \"old\" RocksDBStore instance rather than the new one that was just opened.\r\n\r\nAlthough technically this bug existed before KIP-429, it was only uncovered now that we remove tasks and clear their state/partitions/etc one at a time. We don't technically need to cherrypick the fix back earlier as before we just blindly clear all data structures entirely during an eager rebalance.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-29T02:20:09Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T01:00:29Z","closed_at":"2019-10-30T04:20:01Z","merged_at":"2019-10-30T04:20:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb5c7313b469b2fcd4bcd5042e74affb28f3616e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7608/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7608/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7608/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/01a2aedaf962ef937687f97786c637ed6821efd5","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:8972-close-zombies-together","ref":"8972-close-zombies-together","sha":"01a2aedaf962ef937687f97786c637ed6821efd5","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

following functional changes are implemented here:\r\n• Top-level strings beginning with `\"true\"`, `\"false\"` and then followed by token delimiters (e.g., `\"true}\"` and `\"false]\"`) are parsed as strings, not as booleans\r\n• The empty array (`\"[]\"`) is now parsed as an array with a null value schema\r\n• The empty map (`\"{}\"`) is now parsed as a map with null key and value schemas\r\n• Arrays with all-null elements are now parsed successfully (whereas before an NPE was thrown) as an array with a null value schema\r\n• Maps with all-null values are now parsed as maps with null value schemas, but non-null key schemas\r\n• Strings that appear to be arrays at first but are missing comma delimiters (e.g., `\"[0 1 2]\"`) are now parsed as strings instead of arrays\r\n• A small improvement is made to the debug message generated when map parsing fails due to unexpected comma delimiters (\"Unable to parse a map entry has no key or value\" is changed to \"Unable to parse a map entry with no key or value\")\r\n• A small improvement is made to the debug message generated when map parsing fails due to a missing `}` (\"Map is missing terminating ']'\" is changed to \"Map is missing terminating '}'\")\r\n• A small improvement is made to the debug message generated when array or map parsing fails and parsing is reset to process the input as a string (\"Unable to parse the value as a map\" is changed to \"Unable to parse the value as a map or an array\")\r\n• Embedded values that lack surrounding quotes (e.g., `foo` in `\"[foo]\"`) are no longer treated as strings; this is in line with the JSON-like representation that is meant to be supported by the `Values` class and prevents errors such as parsing `\"[0 1 2]\"` as an array containing a single string element with a value of `\"0 1 2\"`\r\n• The top-level string `\"null\"` is now parsed as `null` instead of the string `\"null\"`; this does not break attempts to convert the top-level string `\"null\"` into a string (which should also be the string `\"null\"`)\r\n\r\nEvery change (except for log message alterations) is verified with one or more unit tests, and several unit tests are also added to prevent regression in functionality that, while not currently broken, is subtle enough that it may be missed in future changes without tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-24T19:45:36Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T06:15:42Z","closed_at":"2020-01-21T19:33:51Z","merged_at":"2020-01-21T19:33:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"58a0b99e92f9caba16003256ee7db771939bb956","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d38391483b7f2c0ae8b0f794a0ce2f209d858176","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-9083","ref":"kafka-9083","sha":"d38391483b7f2c0ae8b0f794a0ce2f209d858176","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

The colon could be escaped, but then the backslash character used to escape the colon is not removed and the parser fails to match the literal as a time or timestamp value.\r\n\r\nThis fix corrects the parsing logic to properly parse timestamp and time literal strings whose colon characters are either escaped or unescaped.

many runs of reproducing the failure (on my local MP5 it takes about 100 - 200 run to get one) I think it is more likely a flaky one and not exposing a real bug in rebalance protocol.\r\n\r\nWhat I've observed is that, when the verifying consumer is trying to fetch from the output topics (there are 11 of them), it `poll(1sec)` each time, and retries 30 times if there's no more data to fetch and stop. It means that if there are no data fetched from the output topics for 30 * 1 = 30 seconds then the verification would stop (potentially too early). And for the failure cases, we observe consistent rebalancing among the closing / newly created clients since the closing is async, i.e. while new clients are added it is possible that closing clients triggered rebalance are not completed yet (note that each instance is configured with 3 threads, and in the worst case there are 6 instances running / pending shutdown at the same time, so a group fo 3 * 6 = 18 members is possible).\r\n\r\nHowever, there's still a possible bug that in KIP-429, somehow the rebalance can never stabilize and members keep re-rejoining and hence cause it to fail. We have another unit test that have bumped up to 3 rebalance by @ableegoldman and if that failed again then it may be a better confirmation such bug may exist.\r\n\r\nSo what I've done so far for this test:\r\n\r\n1. When closing a client, wait for it to complete closure before moving on to the next iteration and starting a new instance to reduce the rebalance churns.\r\n\r\n2. Poll for 5 seconds instead of 1 to wait for longer time: 5 * 30 = 150 seconds, and locally my laptop finished this test in about 50 seconds.\r\n\r\n3. Minor debug logging improvement; in fact some of them is to reduce redundant debug logging since it is too long and sometimes hides the key information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

purpose of this patch is to make the reassignment algorithm simpler and more resilient to unexpected errors. Specifically, it has the following improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Remove `ReassignedPartitionContext`. We no longer need to track the previous reassignment through the context and we now use the assignment state as the single source of truth for the target replicas in a reassignment.\r\n2. Remove the intermediate assignment state when overriding a previous reassignment. Instead, an overriding reassignment directly updates the assignment state and shuts down any unneeded replicas. Reassignments are _always_ persisted in Zookeeper before being updated in the controller context.\r\n3. To fix race conditions with concurrent submissions, reassignment completion for a partition always checks for a zk partition reassignment to be removed. This means the controller no longer needs to track the source of the reassignment.\r\n4. Api reassignments explicitly remove reassignment state from zk prior to beginning the new reassignment. This fixes an inconsistency in precedence. Upon controller failover, zookeeper reassignments always take precedence over any active reassignment. So if we do not have the logic to remove the zk reassignment when an api reassignment is triggered, then we can revert to the older zk reassignment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

the metadata manager loads the groups and the offsets of a partition of the `__consumer-offsets` topic, `GroupMetadataManager.doLoadGroupsAndOffsets` could loop forever if the start offset of the partition is smaller than the end offset and no records are effectively read from the partition.\r\n\r\nWhile the conditions leading to this issue are not clear, I've got the case where a partition was having two segments which were both empty in a cluster. This could theoretically happen when all the tombstones in the first are expired and the second is truncated or when the partition is accidentally corrupted.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect, the `doLoadGroupsAndOffsets` spins forever, blocks the single thread of the scheduler, blocks the loading of all the groups and offsets which are after in the queue, and blocks the expiration of the offsets.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

is not guaranteed to actually fix `queryOnRebalance`, since the\r\nfailure could never be reproduced locally. I did not bump timeouts\r\nbecause it looks like that has been done in the past for this test\r\nwithout success. Instead this change makes the following improvements:\r\n\r\n1. It waits for the application to be in a RUNNING state before\r\nproceeding with the test.\r\n\r\n2. It waits for the remaining instance to return to RUNNING state\r\nwithin a timeout after rebalance. I observed once that we were able to\r\ndo the KV queries but the instance was still in REBALANCING, so this\r\nshould reduce some opportunity for flakiness.\r\n\r\n3. The meat of this change: we now iterate over all keys in one shot\r\n(vs. one at a time with a timeout) and collect various failures, all of\r\nwhich are reported at the end. This should help us to narrow down the\r\ncause of flakiness if it shows up again.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: Condition not met within timeout 120000. waiting for metadata, store and value to be non null\r\n    at org.apache.kafka.test.TestUtils.waitForCondition(TestUtils.java:376)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: Not all keys are available for store word-count-store-stream-three-0 in 120000 ms\r\n    * No value is available for these keys: [goodbye, foo, bar]\r\n    * Exceptions were raised for the following keys:\r\n        Sam:\r\n            java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Ooops\r\n            \tat org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.QueryableStateIntegrationTest.lambda$verifyAllKVKeys$6(QueryableStateIntegrationTest.java:289)\r\n            \tat org.apache.kafka.test.TestUtils.retryOnExceptionWithTimeout(TestUtils.java:417)\r\n            \tat org.apache.kafka.test.TestUtils.retryOnExceptionWithTimeout(TestUtils.java:385)\r\n            \tat org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.QueryableStateIntegrationTest.verifyAllKVKeys(QueryableStateIntegrationTest.java:265)\r\n            \tat org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.QueryableStateIntegrationTest.queryOnRebalance(QueryableStateIntegrationTest.java:431)\r\n\r\n\tat org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:24)\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.
