avoid client subscription data inconsistencies, we need to ensure\r\nthat we minimize the chance that an event is processed while a client is\r\nregistering but before it has fully registered.  There are two major\r\nphases in registration - one is to request filter info from a peer\r\nalready hosting the queue for the client, and the other is doing a GII\r\nof the queue from a peer.  If an event which a client would be\r\ninterested in is processed concurrently during registration, but before\r\nthe filter info has been fully received and processed, the event will be\r\nmissed by the client.  To reduce this window, we will start queueing\r\nevents for the registering client as soon as possible (deserialization\r\nof the client proxy membership ID).  After registration is complete, we\r\ndrain the queued events and put them into the clients subscription\r\nqueue.\r\n\r\nTo make this code unit testable, it was necessary to extract the logic\r\nreading data off the socket/deserializing that data into a separate\r\nclass which can be injected, the ClientRegistrationMetadata class.  This\r\nallows us to mock a ClientRegistrationMetadata without actually doing any IO.\r\nThe CacheClientNotifier could be futher broken up to allow for even more\r\nunit testability, but this was a first step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

problem being solved is that a client putIfAbsent may be retried and be handled\r\nby a server that already has the change but it is not in the server's EventTracker.\r\n\r\nThis commit moves the

This allows the operation to propagate throughout the cluster and\r\nallows the client to receive a valid version tag, if concurrency checks\r\nare enabled.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes GEODE-6630, \"RedundancyLogger might throw NPE\" because\r\ntests were frequently running into that issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
