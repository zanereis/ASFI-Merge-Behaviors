What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a `downScaleFactor` value to `UnixTime` to control scaling of returned values. Default value of `downScaleFactor` is `1000000` (microseconds per second) which means the result of string parsing in microseconds is divided by `1000000` in `UnixTimestamp` and `ToUnixTimestamp`. The `UnixTime` class is used in `ParseToTimestamp` which sets `downScaleFactor` to 1 as proposed in the PR. \r\n\r\nSimilar `timestampScaleFactor` is added to the `Cast` expression to control scaling in casting `timestampScaleFactor ` * `long` <-> `timestamp`.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the `ParseToTimestamp` expression and `to_timestamp` function will be able to parse input strings with timestamps in microsecond precision.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy `DateFunctionsSuite`, and added new test to the test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAccording to SQL standard, value of `DATE` type is union of year, month, dayInMonth, and it is independent from any time zones. To convert it to Catalyst's `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE` value should be \"extended\" by the time at midnight - `00:00:00`. The resulted local date+time should be considered as a timestamp in the session time zone, and casted to microseconds since epoch in `UTC` accordingly. \r\n\r\nThe reverse casting from `TIMESTAMP` to `DATE` should be performed in the similar way. `TIMESTAMP` values should be represented as a local date+time in the session time zone. And the time component should be just removed. For example, `TIMESTAMP 2019-04-10 00:10:12` -> `DATE 2019-04-10`. The resulted date is converted to days since epoch `1970-01-01`. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested by existing test suites - `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite` and `CastSuite`.","created_at":"2019-04-09T22:10:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T15:57:54Z","closed_at":"2019-04-10T14:44:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e918d67f808dfbfc5ed89ad436a428740a728927","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7aafb5a966c02f2f61d80ece84ee106374f2bc3f","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:cast-timestamp-to-date2","ref":"cast-timestamp-to-date2","sha":"7aafb5a966c02f2f61d80ece84ee106374f2bc3f","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to restrict the range of random timestamp literals generated in `LiteralGenerator. timestampLiteralGen`. The generator creates instances of `java.sql.Timestamp` by passing milliseconds since epoch as `Long` type. Converting the milliseconds to microseconds can cause arithmetic overflow of Long type because Catalyst's Timestamp type stores microseconds since epoch in `Long` type internally as well. Proposed interval of random milliseconds is `[Long.MinValue / 1000, Long.MaxValue / 1000]`.\r\n\r\nFor example, generated timestamp `new java.sql.Timestamp(-3948373668011580000)` causes `Long` overflow at the method:\r\n```scala\r\n  def fromJavaTimestamp(t: Timestamp): SQLTimestamp = {\r\n  ...\r\n      MILLISECONDS.toMicros(t.getTime()) + NANOSECONDS.toMicros(t.getNanos()) % NANOS_PER_MICROS\r\n  ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nbecause `t.getTime()` returns `-3948373668011580000` which is multiplied by `1000` at `MILLISECONDS.toMicros`, and the result `-3948373668011580000000` is less than `Long.MinValue`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy `DateExpressionsSuite` in the PR

not having any significance even if it is enabled or disabled.

enabled.\r\nReference:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/StatsDev\r\n\r\nAs part of fix , autoSizeUpdateEnabled  validation is been done initially so that system will calculate the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose simpler implementation of `toJavaTimestamp()`/`fromJavaTimestamp()` by reusing existing functions of `DateTimeUtils`. This will allow to:\r\n- Simply implementation of `toJavaTimestamp()`, and handle properly negative inputs.\r\n- Detect `Long` overflow in conversion of milliseconds (`java.sql.Timestamp`) to microseconds (Catalyst's Timestamp).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy existing test suites `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite` and `CastSuite`. And by new benchmark for export/import timestamps added to `DateTimeBenchmark`:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nTo/from java.sql.Timestamp:               Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)

search\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `HighlyCompressedMapStatus` to use a new feature in RoaringBitmap which buffers insertions to 16-but containers and appends containers to the underlying bitmap as late as possible. This has two effects: the best container type is chosen incrementally, so there is no need to call `runOptimize` and there are never binary searches in the high 16 bits to locate the container to add a bit to, which improves insertion performance. This performance improvement is proportional to the number of empty blocks, but always avoids a call to `runOptimize`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis change was verified not to break existing unit tests. New tests to demonstrate that the new mechanism always builds a bitmap as compressed as a bitmap after calling `runOptimize` were added, as well as justification (in terms of bitmap size) for the existing decision to represent empty blocks rather than full blocks.\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-06T14:56:28Z","updated_at":"2019-04-07T11:56:24Z","closed_at":"2019-04-07T05:56:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42fbf827858305480969f562774e2a825cb30939","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b3200868ec4592f2d0b1aa7847614dad64d72fa8","head":{"label":"richardstartin:use-bitmap-appender","ref":"use-bitmap-appender","sha":"b3200868ec4592f2d0b1aa7847614dad64d72fa8","user":{"login":"richardstartin","id":16439049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDM5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16439049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin","html_url":"https://github.com/richardstartin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richardstartin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4a5768b2a2adf87e3df278655918f72558f0b3b9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs part of schema clipping in `ParquetReadSupport.scala`, we add fields in the Catalyst requested schema which are missing from the Parquet file schema to the Parquet clipped schema. However, nested schema pruning requires we ignore unrequested field data when reading from a Parquet file. Therefore we pass two schema to `ParquetRecordMaterializer`: the schema of the file data we want to read and the schema of the rows we want to return. The reader is responsible for reconciling the differences between the two.\r\n\r\nAside from checking whether schema pruning is enabled, there is an additional complication to constructing the Parquet requested schema. The manner in which Spark's two Parquet readers reconcile the differences between the Parquet requested schema and the Catalyst requested schema differ. Spark's vectorized reader does not (currently) support reading Parquet files with complex types in their schema. Further, it assumes that the Parquet requested schema includes all fields requested in the Catalyst requested schema. It includes logic in its read path to skip fields in the Parquet requested schema which are not present in the file.\r\n\r\nSpark's parquet-mr based reader supports reading Parquet files of any kind of complex schema, and it supports nested schema pruning as well. Unlike the vectorized reader, the parquet-mr reader requires that the Parquet requested schema include only those fields present in the underlying Parquet file's schema. Therefore, in the case where we use the parquet-mr reader we intersect the Parquet clipped schema with the Parquet file's schema to construct the Parquet requested schema that's set in the `ReadContext`.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Additional description (by @HyukjinKwon):_\r\n\r\nLet's suppose that we have a Parquet schema as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmessage spark_schema {\r\n  required int32 id;\r\n  optional group name {\r\n    optional binary first (UTF8);\r\n    optional binary last (UTF8);\r\n  }\r\n  optional binary address (UTF8);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the clipped schema as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmessage spark_schema {\r\n  optional group name {\r\n    optional binary middle (UTF8);\r\n  }\r\n  optional binary address (UTF8);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nParquet MR does not support access to the nested non-existent field (`name.middle`).\r\n\r\nTo workaround this, this PR removes `name.middle` request at all to Parquet reader as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmessage spark_schema {\r\n  optional binary address (UTF8);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand produces the record (`name.middle`) properly as the requested Catalyst schema.\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n-- name: struct (nullable = true)\r\n    |-- middle: string (nullable = true)\r\n-- address: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think technically this is what Parquet library should support since Parquet library made a design decision to produce `null` for non-existent fields IIRC. This PR targets to work around it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA previously ignored test case which exercises the failure scenario this PR addresses has been enabled.\r\n\r\nThis

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe actual implementation doesn't support multi-cluster Kafka connection with delegation token. In this PR I've added this functionality.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains:\r\n* New way of configuration\r\n* Multiple delegation token obtain/store/use functionality\r\n* Documentation\r\n* The change works on DStreams also\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting + additional unit tests.\r\nAdditionally tested on cluster.\r\n\r\nTest scenario:\r\n\r\n* 2 * 4 node clusters\r\n* The 4-4 nodes are in different kerberos realms\r\n* Cross-Realm trust between the 2 realms\r\n* Yarn\r\n* Kafka broker version 2.1.0\r\n* security.protocol = SASL_SSL\r\n* sasl.mechanism = SCRAM-SHA-512\r\n* Artificial exceptions during processing\r\n* Source reads from realm1 sink writes to realm2\r\n\r\nKafka broker settings:\r\n\r\n* delegation.token.expiry.time.ms=600000 (10 min)\r\n*

This addition make it possible to encode Avro objects.\r\n\r\nThe Beans are objects defined by properties; A property is defined by a setter and a getter functions where the getter return type is equal to the setter unique parameter type and the getter and setter functions have the same name; if the getter name is prefixed by \"get\" then the setter name must be prefixed by \"set\"; see tests for bean examples.\r\n\r\nAvro objects are beans and thus we can create an expression encoder for avro objects as follows:\r\n```\r\nimplicit val exprEncoder = ExpressionEncoder[Foo]()\r\n```\r\nAll avro types, including fixed types, and excluding complex union types, are suppported by this addition.\r\n\r\nThe avro fixed types are beans  with exactly one property: bytes.\r\n\r\nCurrently complex avro unions are not supported because a complex union is declared as Object and there is no expression encoder for Object type (need to use a custom serializer like kryo for example)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ncurrently only 1 encodeDecodeTest was added to ExpressionEncoderSuite; the test uses an avro object with all accepted types (ie. array, map, fixed, bytes, enum, ...). \r\n\r\n```\r\n    AvroExample1.newBuilder()\r\n      .setMyarray(List(\"Foo\", \"Bar\").asJava)\r\n      .setMyboolean(true)\r\n      .setMybytes(java.nio.ByteBuffer.wrap(\"MyBytes\".getBytes()))\r\n      .setMydouble(2.5)\r\n      .setMyfixed(new Magic(\"magic\".getBytes))\r\n      .setMyfloat(25.0F)\r\n      .setMyint(100)\r\n      .setMylong(10L)\r\n      .setMystring(\"hello\")\r\n      .setMymap(Map(\r\n        \"foo\" -> new java.lang.Integer(1),\r\n        \"bar\" -> new java.lang.Integer(2)).asJava)\r\n      .setMymoney(Money.newBuilder().setAmount(100.0F).setCurrency(Currency.EUR).build())\r\n      .build(),\r\n    \"Avro encoder with map, array and fixed types\")(\r\n

tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested the UI locally with the javascript console open and didn't observe any problems or JS errors. The only 'risky' change seems to be mustache, but on reading its release notes, don't think the changes from 0.8.1 to 2.x would affect Spark's simple

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to make casting of `TIMESTAMP` to/from `DATE` independent from the session time zone (and system default time zone as well) because both types internally contains intervals since epoch (in `UTC`). In this way, they must be converted directly without any shifts.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy existing test suites like `CastSuite` and `DateTimeUtilsSuite`.","created_at":"2019-04-03T19:33:59Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T15:57:41Z","closed_at":"2019-04-09T13:02:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b6a8824bf6053a7e7f475d59cd10e20895b4227","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24287/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24287/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24287/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/468d7722a1eb4dbc33da3ce0ed7e1466591d4d65","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:cast-timestamp-to-date","ref":"cast-timestamp-to-date","sha":"468d7722a1eb4dbc33da3ce0ed7e1466591d4d65","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the current file source V2 framework, the schema of `FileScan` is not returned correctly if there are overlap columns between `dataSchema` and `partitionSchema`. The actual schema should be \r\n`dataSchema - overlapSchema + partitionSchema`, which might have different column order from the pushed down `requiredSchema` in `SupportsPushDownRequiredColumns.pruneColumns`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the data schema is `[a: String, b: String, c: String]` and the partition schema is `[b: Int, d: Int]`, the result schema is `[a: String, b: Int, c: String, d: Int]` in current `FileTable` and `HadoopFsRelation`. while the actual scan schema is `[a: String, c: String, b: Int, d: Int]` in `FileScan`.\r\n\r\nTo fix the corner case, this PR proposes that the output schema of `FileTable` should be `dataSchema - overlapSchema + partitionSchema`, so that the column order is consistent with `FileScan`.\r\nPutting all the partition columns to the end of table schema is more reasonable. \r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-03T15:51:24Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T05:37:32Z","closed_at":"2019-04-05T05:37:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a31ed4a64c6d6a493781927df8849ef8e11b5e5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24284/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24284/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24284/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a64107dffd7ffd4054eefe36088c38624063c6b3","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:FixReadSchema","ref":"FixReadSchema","sha":"a64107dffd7ffd4054eefe36088c38624063c6b3","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn [SPARK-23503](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20936), we enforce sequencing of committed epochs for Continuous Execution. In case a message for epoch n is lost and epoch (n + 1) is ready for commit before epoch n is, epoch (n + 1) will wait for epoch n to be committed first. With extreme condition, we will wait for `epochBacklogQueueSize` (10000 in default) epochs and then failed. There is no need to wait for such a long time before query fail **if there maybe some message LATE/LOST**. In this PR, we make the condition more sensitive.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nupdate existing unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug where `--supervised` Spark jobs would retry multiple times whenever an agent would crash, come back, and re-register even when those jobs had already relaunched on a different agent.\r\n\r\nThat is: \r\n```\r\n- supervised driver is running on agent1\r\n- agent1 crashes\r\n- driver is relaunched on another agent as `<task-id>-retry-1`\r\n- agent1 comes back online and re-registers with scheduler\r\n- spark relaunches the same job as `<task-id>-retry-2`\r\n- now there are two jobs running simultaneously\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because when an agent would come back and re-register it would send a status update `TASK_FAILED` for its old driver-task. Previous logic would indiscriminately remove the `submissionId` from Zookeeper's `launchedDrivers` node and add it to `retryList` node. Then, when a new offer came in, it would relaunch another `-retry-`  task even though one was previously running. \r\n\r\nFor example logs, scroll to bottom\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Added a unit test to simulate behavior described above\r\n- Tested manually on a DC/OS cluster by\r\n  ```\r\n  - launching a --supervised spark job\r\n  - dcos node ssh <to the agent with the running spark-driver>\r\n  - systemctl stop dcos-mesos-slave\r\n  - docker kill <driver-container-id>\r\n  - [ wait until spark job is relaunched ]\r\n  - systemctl start dcos-mesos-slave\r\n  - [ observe spark driver is not relaunched as `-retry-2` ]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nLog snippets included below. Notice the `-retry-1` task is running when status update for the old task comes in afterward: \r\n```\r\n19/01/15 19:21:38 TRACE MesosClusterScheduler: Received offers from Mesos: \r\n...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI haven't tested by myself on Windows and I am not 100% sure if this is going to cause an actual problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, this one

throw an exception because the newline in the binary is `\\n` but `System.lineSeparator` returns `\\r\\n`.\r\n\r\nI think this is not yet found because this particular codes are not released yet (see SPARK-26426).\r\n\r\nLooks just better to loosen the condition and forget about this stuff.\r\n\r\nThis should be backported into branch-2.4 as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith this change, unnecessary file scans are avoided in case of Limit 0 queries. \r\n\r\nI added a case (rule) to `PropagateEmptyRelation` to replace `GlobalLimit 0` and `LocalLimit 0` nodes with an empty `LocalRelation`. This prunes the subtree under the Limit 0 node and further allows other rules of `PropagateEmptyRelation` to optimize the Logical Plan - while remaining semantically consistent with the Limit 0 query.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n**Query:**\r\n`SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN (SELECT * FROM table2 LIMIT 0) AS table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`\r\n\r\n**Optimized Plan without fix:**\r\n```\r\nJoin Inner, (id#79 = id#87)\r\n:- Filter isnotnull(id#79)\r\n:  +- Relation[id#79,num1#80] parquet\r\n+- Filter isnotnull(id#87)\r\n   +- GlobalLimit 0\r\n      +- LocalLimit 0\r\n         +- Relation[id#87,num2#88] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Optimized Plan with fix:**\r\n`LocalRelation <empty>, [id#75, num1#76, id#77, num2#78]`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests to verify Limit 0 optimization for:\r\n- Simple query containing Limit 0\r\n- Inner Join, Left Outer Join, Right Outer Join, Full Outer Join queries containing Limit 0 as one of their children\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a long-standing bug.\r\n\r\nIn `TaskMemoryManager.acquireExecutionMemory`, we may lock `TaskMemoryManager` and spill `MemoryConsumer`s. `UnsafeExternalSorter` is a `MemoryConsumer` and locks its `SpillableIterator` during spill.\r\n\r\nIn `UnsafeExternalSorter#SpillableIterator.loadNext`, we lock `SpillableIterator` and may call `freePage` which locks `TaskMemoryManager`.\r\n\r\nIf there are 2 threads doing these 2 locking chains together, a deadlock happens:\r\nthread1: lock `TaskMemoryManager` and then `SpillableIterator`\r\nthread2: lock `SpillableIterator` and then `TaskMemoryManager`\r\n\r\nAs an example, PythonUDFExec launches 2 threads for one task, which can trigger this deadlock.\r\n\r\nThe thread dump when the deadlock happens:\r\nthread

addition, after SPARK-26856, the utility function `search_jar` is shared to find `avro` jar files which are identical for both `sbt` and `mvn`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `UnsafeExternalSorter.SpillableIterator#loadNext()` takes lock on the `UnsafeExternalSorter` and calls `freePage` once the `lastPage` is consumed which needs to take a lock on `TaskMemoryManager`. At the same time, there can be another MemoryConsumer using `UnsafeExternalSorter` as part of sorting can try to `allocatePage` needs to get lock on `TaskMemoryManager` which can cause spill to happen which requires lock on `UnsafeExternalSorter` again causing deadlock. This is a classic deadlock situation happening similar to the SPARK-26265.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we can move the `freePage` call in `loadNext` outside of `Synchronized` block similar to the fix in SPARK-26265\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests were being done and will also try to add a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to two things:\r\n\r\n1. Add `deprecated` field to `ExpressionDescription` so that it can be shown in our SQL function documentation (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/), and it can be shown via `DESCRIBE FUNCTION EXTENDED`.\r\n\r\n2. While I am here, add some more restrictions for `note()` and `since()`. Looks some documentations are broken due to malformed `note`:\r\n\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2019-03-31 at 3 00 53 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/55285518-a3e88500-53c8-11e9-9e99-41d857794fbe.png)\r\n\r\n    It should start with 4 spaces and end with a newline. I added some asserts, and fixed the instances together while I am here. This is technically a breaking change but I think it's too trivial to note somewhere (and we're in Spark 3.0.0).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `deprecated` property into `from_utc_timestamp` and `to_utc_timestamp` (it's deprecated as of #24195) as examples of using this field.\r\n\r\nNow it shows the deprecation information as below:\r\n\r\n- **SQL documentation is shown as below:**\r\n\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2019-03-31 at 3 07 31 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/55285537-2113fa00-53c9-11e9-9932-f5693a03332d.png)\r\n\r\n- **`DESCRIBE FUNCTION EXTENDED from_utc_timestamp;`**:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Function: from_utc_timestamp\r\n    Class: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.FromUTCTimestamp\r\n    Usage: from_utc_timestamp(timestamp, timezone) - Given a timestamp like '2017-07-14 02:40:00.0', interprets it as a time in UTC, and renders that time as a timestamp in the given time zone. For example, 'GMT+1' would yield '2017-07-14 03:40:00.0'.\r\n    Extended Usage:\r\n        Examples:\r\n          > SELECT from_utc_timestamp('2016-08-31', 'Asia/Seoul');\r\n           2016-08-31 09:00:00\r\n\r\n        Since: 1.5.0\r\n\r\n        Deprecated:\r\n          Deprecated since 3.0.0. See SPARK-25496.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via:\r\n\r\n- For documentation verification:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ cd sql\r\n    $ sh

This PR proposes to:\r\n1. Rename the rule `FallbackOrcDataSourceV2 ` to `FallBackFileSourceV2`.The name is more generic. And we use \"fall back\" as verb, while \"fallback\" is noun.\r\n2. Rename the method `fallBackFileFormat` in `FileDataSourceV2` to `fallbackFileFormat`. Here we should use \"fallback\" as noun.\r\n3. Add new method `fallbackFileFormat` in `FileTable`. This is for falling back to V1 in rule `FallbackOrcDataSourceV2 `.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting Unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen you submit a stage on a large cluster, rack resolving takes a long time when initializing TaskSetManager because a script is invoked to resolve the rack of each host, one by one.\r\nBased on current implementation, it takes 30~40 seconds to resolve the racks in our 5000 nodes' cluster. After applied the patch, it decreased to less than 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nYARN-9332 has added an interface to handle multiple hosts in one invocation to save time. But before upgrading to the newest Hadoop, we could construct the same tool in Spark to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT and manually testing on a 5000 node
