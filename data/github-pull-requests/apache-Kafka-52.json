if a user tried to perform an overly large batch operation on the KRaft controller (such as creating a million topics), we would create a very large number of records in memory. Our attempt to write these records to the Raft layer would fail, because there were too many to fit in an atomic batch. This failure, in turn, would trigger a controller failover.\r\n\r\n(Note: I am assuming here that no topic creation policy was in place that would prevent the creation of a million topics. I am also assuming that the user operation must be done atomically, which is true for all current user operations, since we have not implemented KIP-868 yet.)\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we fail immediately when the number of records we have generated exceeds the threshold that we can apply. This failure does not generate a controller failover.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement this in a simple way, this PR adds the BoundedList class, which wraps any list and adds a maximum length. Attempts to grow the list beyond this length cause an exception to be thrown.","created_at":"2023-05-22T23:43:48Z","updated_at":"2023-05-31T14:52:38Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T20:16:18Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T20:16:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"b74204fa0a41e5779d513116cb32c0f24e7662c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/64b38e88d931423b8ed1d4f3d3a76ffd634d7fe2","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-14996","ref":"KAFKA-14996","sha":"64b38e88d931423b8ed1d4f3d3a76ffd634d7fe2","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

additional testing for the various KRaft *Image classes.  For every image that we create we already test that we can get there by applying all the records corresponding to that image written out as a list of records.  This patch adds more tests to confirm that we can get to the final image with intermediate stops at all possible intermediate images along the way -- there are O(N^2) such images.  For example, if we have 4 records that comprise a final image, ensure that we can build that exact final image by:\r\n\r\n1. applying the first record against an empty image, creating an initial image, then:\r\n  apply record 2, creating an intermediate image\r\n  apply record 3, creating the next intermediate image\r\n  apply record 4, and checking that this received image matches the expected final image\r\n\r\n2. applying the first record against an empty image, creating an initial image, then:\r\n  apply records 2 and 3, creating an intermediate image\r\n  apply record 4, and checking that this received image matches the expected final image\r\n\r\n3. applying the first record against an empty image, creating an initial image, then:\r\n  apply records 2, 3, and 4, and checking that this received image matches the expected final image\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n\r\n1. applying the first two records against an empty image, creating an initial image, then:\r\n  apply record 3, creating an intermediate image\r\n  apply record 4, and checking that this received image matches the expected final image\r\n\r\n2. applying the first two records against an empty image, creating an initial image, then:\r\n  apply records 3 and 4, and checking that this received image matches the expected final image\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n\r\n1. applying the first three records against an empty image, creating an initial image, then:\r\n  apply record 4, and checking that this received image matches the expected final image\r\n\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n\r\n1. applying all four records against an empty image, and checking that this received image matches the expected final image\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

What changed\r\nAdded a validation to check if the record timestamp is in the future compared to the broker's timestamp and throw an exception to reject the record.\r\n\r\nThe current validation for  checking the record's timestamp based on the configuered ```timestampDiffMaxMs``` remain unchanged. This new validation will take care of scenarios where producers are sending future timestamp for a record.\r\nSpecific changes are:\r\n- Updated validation logic in LogValidator\r\n- Added Unit test coverage for the change\r\n- Update Unit tests that failed because of the new validation logic\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14991\r\nImproves the accuracy of the log validation logic and avoids unexpected gotchas for customers\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Added relevant unit tests\r\n- Reproduced the issue by setting nonseconds instead of miliseconds in the producer logic and verified that validation is working as expected. Example API response\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"responses\":[{\"name\":\"myTopic1\",\"partitionResponses\":[{\"index\":0,\"errorCode\":32,\"baseOffset\":-1,\"logAppendTimeMs\":-1,\"logStartOffset\":0,\"recordErrors\":[\r\n{\"batchIndex\":0,\"batchIndexErrorMessage\":\"Timestamp

controller log4j output for replaying important records. The log message should include word \"replayed\" to make it clear that this is a record replay. Log the replay of records for ACLs, client quotas, and producer IDs, which were previously not logged. Also fix a case where we weren't logging changes to broker registrations.\r\n\r\nAclControlManager, ClientQuotaControlManager, and ProducerIdControlManager didn't previously have a log4j logger object, so this PR adds one. It also converts them to using Builder objects. This makes junit tests more readable because we don't need to specify paramaters where the test can use the default (like LogContexts).\r\n\r\nThrow an exception in replay if we get another TopicRecord for a topic which already exists.\r\n\r\nExample log messages:\r\n  INFO [QuorumController id=3000] Replayed a FeatureLevelRecord setting metadata version to 3.6-IV0\r\n  DEBUG

the partitions of ReplicaFetcherThread finished truncating, the ReplicaAlterLogDirsThread to which these partitions belong needs to be marked truncate. The lag value in the newState (PartitionFetchState) obtained in this process is still the original value (state.lag). If the truncationOffset is smaller than the original state.fetchOffset, then the original lag value is incorrect and needs to be updated. It should be the original lag value plus the difference between the original state.fetchOffset and truncationOffset.\r\n\r\nIf the original lag value is used incorrectly, then ReplicaAlterLogDirsThread may set the wrong lag value for fetcherLagStats when executing \"processFetchRequest\".

The lag value in the newState (PartitionFetchState) obtained in this process is still the original value (state.lag). If the truncationOffset is smaller than the original state.fetchOffset, then the original lag value is incorrect and needs to be updated.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14974:\r\n\r\n> `KafkaBasedLog` is a widely used utility class that provides a generic implementation of a shared, compacted log of records in a Kafka topic. It isn't in Connect's public API, but has been used outside of Connect and we try to preserve backward compatibility whenever possible. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14455 modified the two overloaded void `KafkaBasedLog::send` methods to return a `Future`. While this change is source compatible, it isn't binary compatible. We can restore backward compatibility simply by re-instating the older send methods, and renaming the new Future returning send methods.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

image classes such as MetadataImage, ClusterImage, FeaturesImage, and so forth contain numerous sub-images. This PR adds a structured way of traversing those sub-images. This is useful for the metadata shell, and also for implementing toString functions.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the previous solution was suboptimal. The metadata shell was previously implemented in an ad-hoc way by mutating text-based tree nodes when records were replayed. This was difficult to keep in sync with changes to the record types (for example, we forgot to do this for SCRAM). It was also pretty low-level, being done at a level below that of the image classes. For toString, it was difficult to keep the implementations consistent previously, and also support both redacted and non-redacted output.\r\n\r\nThe metadata shell directory was getting crowded since we never had submodules for it. This PR creates glob/, command/, node/, and state/ directories to keep things better

currently, but it's worth fixing it to avoid unexpected problems.\r\nAnd there is a bunch of of confusing methods in `ApiVersionResponse` which are only used in test code, I moved them to `TestUtils` to make the code more clear, and force everyone to pass in the correct parameters instead of the default zero parameters, for example, empty `supportedFeatures` and empty `finalizedFeatures`.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)*\r\nAdded logic for checking `supportedFeatures` and `finalizedFeatures` in

PR publishes a build scan for every CI build on Jenkins and GitHub Actions and for every local build from an authenticated Apache committer. The build will not fail if publishing fails.\r\n\r\nThe build scans of the Apache Kafka project are published to the Gradle Enterprise instance at [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and run in partnership between the ASF and Gradle. This Gradle Enterprise instance has all features and extensions enabled and is freely available for use by the Apache Kafka project and all other Apache projects.\r\n\r\nThis pull request enhances the functionality of publishing build scans to the publicly available [scans.gradle.com](https://scans.gradle.com/) by instead publishing build scans to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/). On this Gradle Enterprise instance, Apache Kafka will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:\r\n\r\n- Dashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time\r\n- Build failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures\r\n- Test failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests\r\n\r\nIf interested in exploring a fully populated Gradle Enterprise instance, please explore the builds already connected to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), the [Spring project’s instance](https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.relativeStartTime=P28D&search.timeZoneId=Europe/Zurich), or any number of other [OSS projects](https://gradle.com/enterprise-customers/oss-projects/) for which we sponsor instances of Gradle Enterprise.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any questions about the value of Gradle Enterprise or the changes in this pull request and I’d be happy to address them.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-04T20:46:27Z","updated_at":"2023-07-18T23:31:23Z","closed_at":"2023-07-12T08:47:33Z","merged_at":"2023-07-12T08:47:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"451fff8937c626a187371b8fcdf50cfb5177d38f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/72bf6bf742664ca1b84e3e5c1e322d3f34162b01","head":{"label":"clayburn:connect-to-ge.apache.org","ref":"connect-to-ge.apache.org","sha":"72bf6bf742664ca1b84e3e5c1e322d3f34162b01","user":{"login":"clayburn","id":625514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn","html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":636428024,"node_id":"R_kgDOJe8e-A","name":"kafka","full_name":"clayburn/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clayburn","id":625514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn","html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch introduces the `PartitionWriter` interface in the `group-coordinator` module. The `ReplicaManager` resides in the `core` module and it is thus not accessible from the `group-coordinator` one. The `PartitionWriterImpl` is basically an implementation of the interface residing in `core` which interfaces with the `ReplicaManager`.\r\n\r\nOne notable difference from the usual produce path is that the `PartitionWriter` returns the offset following the written records. This is then used by the coordinator runtime (coming later) to track when the request associated with the write can be completed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

an instance (or thread within an instance) of Kafka Streams has a soft failure and the group coordinator triggers a rebalance, that instance would temporarily become a \"zombie writer\". That is, this instance does not know there's already a new rebalance and hence its partitions have been migrated out, until it tries to commit and then got notified of the illegal-generation error and realize itself is the \"zombie\" already. During this period until the commit, this zombie may still be writing data to the changelogs of the migrated tasks as the new owner has already taken over and also writing to the changelogs.\r\n\r\nWhen EOS is enabled, this would not be a problem: when the zombie tries to commit and got notified that it's fenced, its zombie appends would be aborted. With EOS disabled, though, such shared writes would be interleaved on the changelogs where a zombie append may arrive later after the new writer's append, effectively overwriting that new append.\r\n\r\nNote that such interleaving writes do not necessarily cause corrupted data: as long as the new producer keep appending after the old zombie stops, and all the corrupted keys are overwritten again by the new values, then it is fine. However, if there are consecutive rebalances where right after the changelogs are corrupted by zombie writers, and before the new writer can overwrite them again, the task gets migrated again and needs to be restored from changelogs, the old values would be restored instead of the new values, effectively causing data loss.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new producer configuration to enable registering a transaction ID, but without requiring the client to use any of the transactional operations. This enables using the transaction ID to fence the zombie producer, just as with EOS, but when in ALOS mode. The new configuration is used in the streams producer when ALOS is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe change includes an ALOS integration test that reliably fails without the `transaction.id`, and reliably passes with the `transaction.id`.","created_at":"2023-05-03T16:09:43Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T03:37:56Z","closed_at":"2025-01-02T03:37:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

a bunch of tests in `RaftClusterSnapshotTest`, `KRaftClusterTest`, `QuorumControllerTest` failed in recent builds: [#_1801](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka/job/trunk/1801), [#_1800](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka/job/trunk/1800) after this PR merged: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13407. \r\n\r\nDid some investigation, found they all failed because of this kind of error: (ex: [here](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka/job/trunk/1800/testReport/junit/kafka.server/KRaftClusterTest/Build___JDK_8_and_Scala_2_12___testIncrementalAlterConfigs__/), [here](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka/job/trunk/1801/testReport/junit/kafka.server/KRaftClusterTest/Build___JDK_11_and_Scala_2_13___testUnregisterBroker__/))\r\n```\r\norg.apache.kafka.server.fault.FaultHandlerException: fatalFaultHandler: exception while activating controller: xxxxx\r\n```\r\n\r\nMostly, the reason of exception thrown is `No controller appears to be active`. And it's because when the active controller tried to write and commit the activation messages, the leadership changed to other nodes, which is quite normal. We should not treat it as fatal error with this case. \r\n\r\nAnd there are also cases like this ([here](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka/job/trunk/1801/testReport/junit/org.apache.kafka.controller/QuorumControllerTest/Build___JDK_8_and_Scala_2_13___testUpgradeMigrationStateFrom34__/))\r\n```\r\norg.apache.kafka.server.fault.FaultHandlerException: fatalFaultHandler: exception while activating controller: java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException\r\n```\r\nIt's because while activating the controller, it's shutting down. Again, this should not be a fatal error, instead, we can just fail this commit as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-27T09:52:30Z","updated_at":"2023-04-28T20:43:46Z","closed_at":"2023-04-28T02:09:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a62f10ff65a1d40244bb9146da7898219dc5057","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13647/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13647/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/07dee34049cedece248960685ca1a4dc0a256364","head":{"label":"showuon:fixKRaftClusterTest","ref":"fixKRaftClusterTest","sha":"07dee34049cedece248960685ca1a4dc0a256364","user":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":249690395,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDk2OTAzOTU=","name":"kafka","full_name":"showuon/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/showuon/kafka","description":"Mirror

(The confusion arose because of internal ZK representation details that treated them both as \"client configs.\")\r\n\r\nAdd unit tests for ClientQuotaControlManager.isValidIpEntity and ClientQuotaControlManager.configKeysForEntityType.\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't affect metadata record application, only input validation. If there are bad client quotas that are set currently, this change will not alter the current behavior (of throwing an exception and ignoring the bad quota).","created_at":"2023-04-26T23:14:54Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T17:43:02Z","closed_at":"2023-04-27T17:42:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14d3f4cbbcb03557ec358244cc01e53202d783c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4ba88ce89411d22dfa10fc8d35a34e00887ca1f7","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-14943","ref":"KAFKA-14943","sha":"4ba88ce89411d22dfa10fc8d35a34e00887ca1f7","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

the exact record offset to QuorumController.replay() in all cases. There are several situations\r\nwhere this is useful, such as logging, implementing metadata transactions, or handling broker\r\nregistration records.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the QC is inactive, and simply replaying records, it is easy to compute the exact\r\nrecord offset from the batch base offset and the record index.\r\n\r\nThe active QC case is more difficult. Technically, when we submit records to the Raft layer, it can\r\nchoose a batch end offset later than the one we expect, if someone else is also adding records.\r\nWhile the QC is the only entity submitting data records, control records may be added at any time.\r\nIn the current implementation, these are really only used for leadership elections. However, this\r\ncould change with the addition of quorum reconfiguration or similar features.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR allows the QC to tell the Raft layer that a record append should fail if it\r\nwould have resulted in a batch end offset other than what was expected. This in turn will trigger a\r\ncontroller failover. In the future, if automatically added control records become more common, we\r\nmay wish to have a more sophisticated system than this simple optimistic concurrency mechanism. But\r\nfor now, this will allow us to rely on the offset as correct.\r\n\r\nIn order that the active QC can learn what offset to start writing at, the PR also adds a new\r\nendOffset parameter to handleLeaderChange. Since the Raft layer only invokes handleLeaderChange on\r\nthe active once it has replayed the log, this information should always be up-to-date in that\r\ncontext.\r\n\r\nAt the Raft level, this PR adds a new exception, UnexpectedEndOffsetException. This gets thrown\r\nwhen we request an end offset that doesn't match the one the Raft layer would have given us.\r\nAlthough this exception should cause a failover, it should not be considered a fault. This\r\ncomplicated the exception handling a bit and motivated splitting more of it out into the new\r\nEventHandlerExceptionInfo class. This will also let us unit test things like slf4j log messages a\r\nbit better.","created_at":"2023-04-25T23:24:33Z","updated_at":"2023-07-28T00:02:00Z","closed_at":"2023-07-28T00:01:55Z","merged_at":"2023-07-28T00:01:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"10bcd4fc7f7258c20d5b0cdedf91ebb54697f97a","assignee":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dengziming","id":26023240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIzMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26023240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming","html_url":"https://github.com/dengziming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13643/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13643/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13643/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/fb67f9db614daa2badc44caefbdc8dabce2d4004","head":{"label":"cmccabe:txn1","ref":"txn1","sha":"fb67f9db614daa2badc44caefbdc8dabce2d4004","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.gith
