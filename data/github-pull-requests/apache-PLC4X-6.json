href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues?q=milestone%3A0.12.4+is%3Aissue\">10 issues</a>, with two especially noteworthy changes, and a number of other smaller bug fixes and enhancements.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The default Jackson deserializer will now reject duplicate JSON members by default in an attempt to be a little more strict at rejecting potentially malicious or malformed JSON.  This is a default and can be overridden with a custom <code>ObjectMapper</code> if desired.</li>\n<li>Password-based JWE encryption key algorithms (<code>PBES2_HS256_A128KW</code>, <code>PBES2_HS384_A192KW</code> and <code>PBES2_HS512_A256KW</code>) now enforce an upper bound (maximum) number of iterations allowed during decryption to mitigate against potential DoS attacks. Many thanks to Jingcheng Yang and Jianjun Chen from Sichuan University and Zhongguancun Lab for their work on this!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A number of other issues fixed: thread-safe <code>ServiceLoader</code> usage for dynamic JSON processor lookup, Android enhancements for JSON <code>Reader</code> APIs, fixed Elliptic Curve field element padding, and more.  Please read the <a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/blob/0.12.4/CHANGELOG.md\">0.12.4 CHANGELOG</a> for full details of all of these changes, and as always, project documentation is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/blob/0.12.4/README.md\">0.12.4 README</a>.</p>\n<p>Please allow 30 minutes from the time this announcement is published for the release to be available in Maven Central.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>0.12.4</h3>\n<p>This patch release includes various changes listed below.</p>\n<h4>Jackson Default Parsing Behavior</h4>\n<p>This release makes two behavioral changes to JJWT's default Jackson <code>ObjectMapper</code> parsing settings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the interest of having stronger standards to reject potentially malformed/malicious/accidental JSON that could\nhave undesirable effects on an application, JJWT's default <code>ObjectMapper </code>is now configured to explicitly reject/fail\nparsing JSON (JWT headers and/or Claims) if/when that JSON contains duplicate JSON member names.</p>\n<p>For example, now the following JSON, if parsed, would fail (be rejected) by default:</p>\n<pre lang=\"json\"><code>{\n  &quot;hello&quot;: &quot;world&quot;,\n  &quot;thisWillFail&quot;: 42,\n  &quot;thisWillFail&quot;: &quot;test&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Technically, the JWT RFCs <em>do allow</em> duplicate named fields as long as the last parsed member is the one used\n(see <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-4\">JWS RFC 7515, Section 4</a>), so this is allowed.\nHowever, because JWTs often reflect security concepts, it's usually better to be defensive and reject these\nunexpected scenarios by default. The RFC later supports this position/preference in\n<a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-10.12\">Section 10.12</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>Ambiguous and potentially exploitable situations\ncould arise if the JSON parser used does not enforce the uniqueness\nof member names or returns an unpredictable value for duplicate\nmember names.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, this is just a default, and the RFC does indeed allow duplicate member names if the last value is used,\nso applications that require duplicates to be allowed can simply configure their own <code>ObjectMapper</code> and use\nthat with JJWT instead of assuming this (new) JJWT default. See\n[Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/877\">#877</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/877\">jwtk/jjwt#877</a>) for more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If using JJWT's support to use Jackson to parse\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt#json-jackson-custom-types\">Custom Claim Types</a> (for example, a Claim that should be\nunmarshalled into a POJO), and the JSON for that POJO contained a member that is not represented in the specified\nclass, Jackson would fail parsing by default.  Because POJOs and JSON data models can sometimes be out of sync\ndue to different class versions, the default behavior has been changed to ignore these unknown JSON members instead\nof failing (i.e. the <code>ObjectMapper</code>'s  <code>DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES</code> is now set to <code>false</code>)\nby default.</p>\n<p>Again, if you prefer the stricter behavior of rejecting JSON with extra or unknown properties, you can configure\n<code>true</code> on your own <code>ObjectMapper</code> instance and use that instance with the <code>Jwts.parser()</code> builder.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Additional Changes</h4>\n<p>This release also:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

and an Attribute's key is changed (\nvia <code>Attribute.setKey(String)</code>), the source range is now still tracked\nin <code>Attribute.sourceRange()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2070\">2070</a></li>\n<li><strong>Wildcard attribute selector</strong>: Added support for the <code>[*]</code> element with any attribute selector.

The fix includes a EvaluatorDebug class\nthat generates a sexpr to represent the query, allowing simpler and more thorough query parse\ntests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2073\">2073</a></li>\n<li><strong>XML CData output</strong>: When generating XML-syntax output from parsed HTML, script nodes containing (pseudo) CData\nsections would have an extraneous CData section added, causing script execution errors. Now, the data content is\nemitted in a HTML/XML/XHTML polyglot format, if the data is not already within a CData\nsection. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2078\">2078</a></li>\n<li><strong>Thread safety</strong>: The <code>:has</code> evaluator held a non-thread-safe Iterator, and so if an Evaluator object was\nshared across multiple concurrent threads, a NoSuchElement exception may be thrown, and the selected results may be\nincorrect. Now, the iterator object is a thread-local. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2088\">2088</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES.md\">org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.17.2 (2023-Dec-29)</h2>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attribute object accessors</strong>: Added <code>Element.attribute(String)</code> and <code>Attributes.attribute(String)</code> to more simply\nobtain an <code>Attribute</code> object. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2069\">2069</a></li>\n<li><strong>Attribute source tracking</strong>: If source tracking is on, and an Attribute's key is changed (\nvia <code>Attribute.setKey(String)</code>), the source range is now still tracked\nin <code>Attribute.sourceRange()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2070\">2070</a></li>\n<li><strong>Wildcard attribute selector</strong>: Added support for the <code>[*]</code> element with any attribute selector.

Now, the data content is\nemitted in a HTML/XML/XHTML polyglot format, if the data is not already within a CData\nsection. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2078\">2078</a></li>\n<li><strong>Thread safety</strong>: The <code>:has</code> evaluator held a non-thread-safe Iterator, and so if an Evaluator object was\nshared across multiple concurrent threads, a NoSuchElement exception may be thrown, and the selected results may be\nincorrect. Now, the iterator object is a thread-local. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2088\">2088</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Older changes for versions 0.1.1 (2010-Jan-31) through 1.17.1 (2023-Nov-27) may be found in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/change-archive.txt\">change-archive.txt</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/9dec1baba5b3d0fa11268c95630b391f9de664ad\"><code>9dec1ba</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release jsoup-1.17.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d3a572423233ff6ce4ff2892e60e4c80febc7b9c\"><code>d3a5724</code></a> Changelog for 1.17.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/1963a7c17fc8b95ec6f6d150d716c9d9c4065c2e\"><code>1963a7c</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin from 3.12.0 to 3.12.1 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2\">#2</a>...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d4b2c36dadad3e644d1c1b5b85aa704b22c3b077\"><code>d4b2c36</code></a> Simplify node filtering operations using Streams API (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2080\">#2080</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/78be89abde691c066fd55a1ca24254447e21cfe6\"><code>78be89a</code></a> Move iter into Has class</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/374ded2bc3d57108fffbead844371ecc5fab63ee\"><code>374ded2</code></a> Use a threadlocal to hold the NodeIterator</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/4fb1036ce7892fa1f938cee4f37435e85dd30797\"><code>4fb1036</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin from 3.2.2 to 3.2.3 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2086\">#2086</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/c9ce65a9fec3cf6ddeb2dbe5d98214b6a03698b4\"><code>c9ce65a</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-failsafe-plugin from 3.2.2 to 3.2.3 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2085\">#2085</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/20c9162234e55a297cd1a2195af70d9353ab3e05\"><code>20c9162</code></a> Bump org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin from 3.11.0 to 3.12.0 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2\">#2</a>...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d5bc100eab6238b4b682a45fc04e829ff46459ef\"><code>d5bc100</code></a> Corrected namespace tests</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/compare/jsoup-1.17.1...jsoup-1.17.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.jsoup:jsoup&package-manager=maven&previous-version=1.17.1&new-version=1.17.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set the ISOTP frame_txtime to real zero for the isotp listener test. The default changed with kernel 5.15.34 and made the test very slow.</li>\n<li>Correctly construct CAN FD frames when setting the FD_FLAG_FD_FRAME flag but not providing more than 8 bytes of data</li>\n<li>Correct strict-mode in the setup-vcan.sh script so it properly created the vcan device</li>\n<li>Correctly configure the surefire plugin to use JUnit 5 instead of 4, so tests can be run with maven again</li>\n<li>Use logback's 1.3.x version that is still compatible with Java 8 instead of the 1.4.x version</li>\n<li>Only build the *-arch-detect modules when using the <code>all-architectures</code> profile, since they don't make sense without that</li>\n<li>Restart the epoll_wait syscall on EINTR</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally 3.3.1 can now also be built with docker and not just with podman.</p>\n<p><strong>Caution</strong>: Technically this release contains a small API breakage: <code>IsotpOptions.withFrameTransmissionType</code> has been renamed to <code>IsotpOptions.withFrameTransmissionTime</code>. Given that no bug reports for this exist, I assume that nobody actually used this method and it is save to rename it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/6798e29cc7849c00fb75b60f4c7029ecd1326451\"><code>6798e29</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release javacan-3.3.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/8c5c53f81cd09fc29d5e344e3004998f4b669124\"><code>8c5c53f</code></a> it seems <code>deploy</code> is broken from <code>release</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/b048e6e6ca9b68155d7d2c9c2040e98461b2fc94\"><code>b048e6e</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/0bb419df8ba3fd7042f23697dcfc67a3cdca0fb2\"><code>0bb419d</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release javacan-3.3.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/2d937fac7c7e10ad739a6b551224278776bf6f16\"><code>2d937fa</code></a> setting the txtime to zero on both fixes the delay</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/1f93cee5b5764911155fce3ea1c851c80d1f3da3\"><code>1f93cee</code></a> set the frame_txtime to (real) zero for the test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/1f9af9de133828a18867de4cf89fbf45e1c5e9b8\"><code>1f9af9d</code></a> a bunch of tweaks to the isotp listener test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/1f5468d38de215da61bc80e592d2550295b7dc7b\"><code>1f5468d</code></a> restart the epoll syscall on EINTR</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/e0a6aec9983c55e0182dc78346cd5c7bb172fe2d\"><code>e0a6aec</code></a> update can headers to linux 6.6</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/commit/c895e7d474d71fe2d5d3c4f49745ab2962092bdf\"><code>c895e7d</code></a> fix the setup-vcan.sh strict mode command</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN/compare/javacan-3.3.0...javacan-3.3.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=tel.schich:javacan-core&package-manager=maven&previous-version=3.3.0&new-version=3.3.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

instead.</strong></p>\n<p>This release fixes a regression that appears in rare circumstances when using <code>Unmarshal</code> or <code>UnmarshalExact</code> to decode values onto pointers with multiple indirection (eg. pointer to a pointer, etc). The change was introduced in 1.18.0 as a means to resolve a long-standing bug when decoding environment variables to structs.</p>\n<p>The feature is now disabled by default and can be enabled using the <code>viper_bind_struct</code> build tag. It's also considered experimental at this point, so breaking changes may be introduced in the future.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes 🐛</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>feat!: hide struct binding behind a feature flag by <a href=\"https://github.com/sagikazarmark\"><code>@​sagikazarmark</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/spf13/viper/pull/1715\">spf13/viper#1715</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/viper/compare/v1.18.1...v1.18.2\">https://github.com/spf13/viper/compare/v1.18.1...v1.18.2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/viper/commit/ab3a50c0ce2020028f8cb515c62fc4d2d97a8996\"><code>ab3a50c</code></a> fix!: hide struct binding behind a feature flag</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/viper/commit/9154b900c34ad9d88897f7e5288ce43f457f698b\"><code>9154b90</code></a> build(deps): bump actions/setup-go from 4.1.0 to 5.0.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/viper/commit/08e4a009491f5fdcd8f2d2d1ee0c4a96d3e4973d\"><code>08e4a00</code></a> build(deps): bump github/codeql-action from 2.22.8 to 2.22.9</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/viper/compare/v1.18.1...v1.18.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=github.com/spf13/viper&package-manager=go_modules&previous-version=1.18.1&new-version=1.18.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

some package-private methods whose signature includes the Java 8 <code>Collector</code> API. This is a test to identify any problems before we expose those methods publicly to users. Please report any problems that you encounter. (73dbf7ef26)</li>\n<li>Changed various classes to catch <code>Exception</code> instead of <code>RuntimeException</code> even when only <code>RuntimeException</code> is theoretically possible. This can help code that throws undeclared exceptions, as some bytecode rewriters (e.g., Robolectric) and languages (e.g., Kotlin) do. (c294c23760, 747924e, b2baf48)</li>\n<li>Added an <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code> to <code>failureaccess</code>, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">Guava's one strong runtime dependency</a>. (280b5d2f60)</li>\n<li><code>reflect</code>: In <code>guava-android</code> only, removed <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. These methods never worked in an Android VM, and to reflect that, they were born <code>@Deprecated</code>, <code>@Beta</code>, and <code>@DoNotCall</code>. They're now preventing us from rolling out some new Android compatibility testing. This is <strong>the only binary-incompatible change in this release</strong>, and it should have no effect in practice. Still, we bump the major version number to follow Semantic Versioning. (045cd8428f)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed our implementations to avoid eagerly initializing loggers during class loading. This can help performance, especially under Android.

[github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) from 2.6.0 to 2.7.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/releases\">github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Version 2.7.0 Feature Release</h2>\n<p>Significant changes in this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced <code>ColorNone</code> which can be used in a style to avoid changing the existing foreground or background color.</li>\n<li>Refactored the screen logic to provide better code reuse and facilitate extending the Screen API in future releases.  (This changes internal APIs only)</li>\n<li><code>Color</code> grew some methods to report a <code>String()</code> (color name) or <code>CSS()</code> (color hex string in CSS style)</li>\n<li><code>LockRegion()</code> and <code>Tty</code> API changes from Tim Culverhouse <a href=\"mailto:tim@timculverhouse.com\">tim@timculverhouse.com</a> in support of Sixel coexistence.  This does not itself provide support for Sixel graphics, but it allows tcell applications to be used with other sixel graphics libraries.</li>\n<li>Mouse focus reporting (see <code>EnableFocus()</code>,  <code>DisableFocus()</code>, and <code>EventFocus</code>) courtesy of stk <a href=\"mailto:stk@ableton.com\">stk@ableton.com</a> (I also added support for focus reporting in the WASM terminal.)  Windows console does not report this yet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The refactoring in particular will enable some further improvements.  Also, we added more test cases and coverage.  While much of tcell remains uncovered by formal testing, every improvement here is welcome.</p>\n<p>I expect to follow up with another release soon -- things I'm hoping for are gpm mouse support for the linux console (oft-requested), refactoring wide character support to fix some long standing bugs, and convenience methods to apply content or style changes to a rectangular region of the screen.
