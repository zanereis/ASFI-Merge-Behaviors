Description ##\r\ncuDNN expects bias stride to be (C, 1, C, C), whereas currently it is provided by MXNet as (C, 1, 1, 1).\r\nThis PR also changes the order of calls to wgrad and bgrad. This has potential to boost performance, because wgrad uses the same data as bgrad, but is typically compute-limited (so the data transfer cost is hidden), so there is a chance that the data needed by purely BW-bound bgrad is already in cache.. \r\n\r\n@DickJC123

Description ##\r\nHi MXNet community, \r\n\r\nI would like to propose another feature in MXNet Extensions for \"_external ops_\". Currently we have the following categories of operators in MXNet:\r\n- **builtin/backend operators** are those defined in the src/operator directory and are compiled into libmxnet.so\r\n- **Python custom operators** are custom operators written in Python by users (not part of MXNet source code)\r\n- **C++ custom operators** are custom operators written in C++ by users (not part of MXNet source code) that use the MXNet Extensions (lib_api.h)\r\n\r\n_External operators_ will be builtin/backend operators but not compiled into libmxnet.so. Instead, they will be compiled into a separate shared object and dynamically loaded at runtime similar to C++ custom operators. \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nCurrent C++ custom operators were designed to be simple to write, and easy to add to MXNet. They were not intended to be feature-equivalent to builtin/backend operators. There have been many users who start with a fork of MXNet, add some custom operators, and then try and use the C++ custom operator to load them. But C++ custom operators were not designed to be used this way. \r\n\r\nCurrent examples\r\n- https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17559 intgemm operators could be made available as a separate library of ops instead of contributing directly to the MXNet repo to distribute to users\r\n- Prototyping of new operators (like those for BERT) can have a better flow:\r\n  - start in custom fork, build, test\r\n  - compile into separate library, shared with others, test\r\n  - community rejects the new ops, or new ops cause complications to MXNet codebase so best to keep them separate\r\n  - keep op source code in separate library, depend on MXNet as 3rdparty/submodule, build/distribute separate library of ops\r\n\r\n### Current prototype flow\r\n1. add your custom op files to src/operator directory\r\n2. compile MXNet normally\r\n3. go find _my_op.cc.o_ file(s) in the build directory\r\n4. package *.o files into a shared object like _libmy_op.so_\r\n5. dynamically load shared library into MXNet via `mx.library.load()`\r\n\r\nThe example in **example/extensions/lib_external_ops** shows a minimum useful example. In the **min_ex-inl.h** file we define the minimum required components of a backend operator in MXNet:\r\n```\r\nvoid MinExForward(const nnvm::NodeAttrs& attrs,\r\n                  const OpContext& ctx,\r\n                  const std::vector<TBlob>& inputs,\r\n                  const std::vector<OpReqType>& req,\r\n                  const std::vector<TBlob>& outputs) {\r\n  //do nothing                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\ninline bool MinExOpShape(const nnvm::NodeAttrs& attrs,\r\n                         mxnet::ShapeVector* in_attrs,\r\n                         mxnet::ShapeVector* out_attrs) {\r\n    //do nothing                                                                                                                                                                       \r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninline bool MinExOpType(const nnvm::NodeAttrs& attrs,\r\n                        std::vector<int> *in_attrs,\r\n                        std::vector<int> *out_attrs) {\r\n  //do nothing                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen in the **min_ex.cc** file we register the operator:\r\n```\r\nNNVM_REGISTER_OP(min_ex)\r\n.describe(\"some description\")\r\n.set_num_inputs(0)\r\n.set_num_outputs(0)\r\n.set_attr<mxnet::FInferShape>(\"FInferShape\", MinExOpShape)\r\n.set_attr<nnvm::FInferType>(\"FInferType\", MinExOpType)\r\n.set_attr<FCompute>(\"FCompute<cpu>\", MinExForward);\r\n```\r\nWhile this operator doesnt actually do anything, it has enough parts to register successfully and execute. Putting these two files in **src/operator** and building MXNet will produce a **min_ex.cc.o** file somewhere. After copying this file back into the **example/extensions/lib_external_ops** directory we can build a shared object with the operator implementation in it. The compilation command in this example is:\r\n```\r\ng++ -shared -fPIC -std=c++11 init_lib.cc min_ex.cc.o ../../../src/lib_api.cc -o libmin_ex.so -I../../../include -L../../../build -lmxnet\r\n```\r\nNotice that we compile **lib_api.cc** and **init_lib.cc** into the library also, these are the APIs necessary to use the `MXLoadLib` API. We also link it against **libmxnet.so** since the library depends on symbols in MXNet (after all thats the whole point, for this operator to have access to all the internal goodies that regular operators have). After building `libmin_ex.so` we can load it into MXNet dynamically at runtime by using the existing `library.load()` API:\r\n```\r\nmx.library.load('libmin_ex.so`)\r\n```\r\nDuring loading the of the library (ie. in `dlopen`) the operator will be registered directly into the MXNet operator Registry. There are no additional overheads or lambda functions for these operators. \r\n\r\n### Other Considerations\r\n- Needed to refactor lib_api.h into lib_api.cc so that we can compile the necessary APIs into the shared object in order to load the library using the same [`MXLoadLib` API](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/2610c10701c2b8155dbf094aaecba37ebbf67d0f/src/c_api/c_api.cc#L1465)\r\n- Needed to remove the `dlclose` on libraries loaded inside libmxnet.so. Since operators are existing in the library loaded by MXNet, MXNet needs to destruct and free all allocated memory before exiting. But, the objects/functions in the library still need to be available during destruction. So the custom library must outlive libmxnet.so. For python, we can move the `dlclose` from libmxnet.so to Python no problem. But for C/C++ users, they will need to call dlcose on their own. So we had to change the signature of `MXLoadLib` to: `MXNET_DLL int MXLoadLib(const char *path, unsigned verbose, void** lib);` and return the void* pointer to the library.\r\n\r\n### Open

`pushpull` could be called on a wrong key when the model uses shared_parameter, and I created a minimal reproducible example https://gist.github.com/ZiyueHuang/2c9384c60de04fb2ca943236bedd15b8. After this PR, the training will proceeds normally.\r\n\r\nThe reason: when the model uses shared parameters, `param` in this [line](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/gluon/trainer.py#L108) contains duplicate parameters while `self._params` contains distinct parameters, and in the current implementation `trainer._init_params` uses the index in `param` as the key (see [line](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/gluon/trainer.py#L175)) while `trainer._allreduce_grads` uses the index in `self._params` as the key, thus there exists a mismatch (meaning that for the same parameter, the init and all_reduce operation are performed on different keys).\r\n\r\ncc @sxjscience @eric-haibin-lin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with

Description ##\r\nGluon trainer is usually constructed with `Trainer(net.collect_params())`. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-07T22:14:17Z","updated_at":"2020-08-08T01:11:17Z","closed_at":"2020-08-08T01:11:17Z","merged_at":"2020-08-08T01:11:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5fdcbf3bae3ea85cb89394147db4b1da0105fb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18877/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18877/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18877/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9e2e32989bd25a60e0fa5fac0069aef9752e5b93","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:trainer-list","ref":"trainer-list","sha":"9e2e32989bd25a60e0fa5fac0069aef9752e5b93","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

This is suggested in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18855\r\n\r\nOpenBLAS 64 is built from source using this script:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n\r\n# This script builds the static library of openblas that can be used as dependency of mxnet.\r\nset -ex\r\nrm -rf ~/deps\r\nmkdir ~/deps\r\nDEPS_PATH=~/deps\r\nOPENBLAS_VERSION=develop\r\n\r\nif [[ (! -e $DEPS_PATH/lib/libopenblas.a) || (! -e $DEPS_PATH/lib/libopenblas.so) ]]; then\r\n# download and build openblas\r\n>&2 echo \"Building openblas...\"\r\n\r\nwget \\\r\nhttps://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/archive/${OPENBLAS_VERSION}.zip \\\r\n-O ${DEPS_PATH}/openblas.zip\r\nunzip -q $DEPS_PATH/openblas.zip -d $DEPS_PATH\r\npushd .\r\ncd $DEPS_PATH/OpenBLAS-${OPENBLAS_VERSION}\r\n\r\necho -e \"DYNAMIC_ARCH=1\\nDYNAMIC_OLDER=1\\nUSE_OPENMP=1\\nINTERFACE64=1\\nBINARY=64\\nNO_SHARED=0\\nNO_LAPACK=0\\nSYMBOLSUFFIX=64_\" >> Makefile.rule\r\nCXX=\"g++ -fPIC\" CC=\"gcc -fPIC\" make -j\r\n\r\n# make -j PREFIX=$DEPS_PATH install\r\nsudo make -j PREFIX=/usr/local install\r\n\r\npopd\r\n\r\nfi\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR currently only works with `USE_LAPACK=0`.

`libopenblas64_.so.0` which is our OpenBLAS 64 build.\r\n\r\n```\r\nubuntu@ip-172-31-6-47:~/blasfix/build$ ldd libmxnet.so \r\n\tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd12965000)\r\n\tlibdl.so.2 =>

Description ##\r\nremove unnecessary usage of pretrained models, and prefer smaller size in tests\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] remove unnecessary usage of pretrained models, and prefer smaller size in tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- #18843 prevents the tests that use export from being switched.\r\n- this attempts at addressing timeout in test_gluon_model_zoo\r\n- the built-in gluon model zoo will be deprecated. later on, the models will be moved to test_utils.py only for testing purpose.","created_at":"2020-08-03T00:18:45Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T21:11:59Z","closed_at":"2020-08-03T15:59:34Z","merged_at":"2020-08-03T15:59:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"54b9e9c8d063fa00853e6cf80d22c922014e3e67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18844/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18844/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18844/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/618516046b6e1deaefe1a65c6321f9374c033aee","head":{"label":"szha:ci_model_zoo","ref":"ci_model_zoo","sha":"618516046b6e1deaefe1a65c6321f9374c033aee","user":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92538952,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MjUzODk1Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"szha/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/szha/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Although external blas libraries support large tensors (>2^32 sized), large dimensions (>= 2^31) will trigger an openblas int overflow error under current configuration. This PR adds checks to exit those use cases properly.\r\n\r\nDone:\r\n1. gemm and gemm2\r\n2. trmm and trms\r\n3. syrk\r\n4. gelqf\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\nAll done. The rest of operators take square matrices as inputs, which cannot possibly have large dimensions (>= 2^31) because of memory constrains. For example a 2^32 * 2*31 float matrix will take up 2^24 TB of memory! \r\n```\r\nubuntu@ip-172-31-6-47:~/mx/incubator-mxnet/build$  nosetests --logging-level=DEBUG --verbose -s

this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nSupport additional inputs to custom subgraph ops that are not direct dependencies to ops in the subgraph. This will enable various use cases: custom control flow ops, custom ops that maintain a state that should be saved/loaded, etc.\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\n- Added test that uses a graph pass (`addInputPass`) to add a new custom input to the subgraph op\r\n- Added new optional argument (`clear`) to `hybridize` & `optimize_for` APIs in Gluon Block to enable multiple optimizations\r\n- refactored lib_api.h JSON utilities\r\n- added new Graph data structure utilities to simplify custom graph passes\r\n- refactored custom op registration\r\n- enhanced custom subgraph op to support additional inputs to subgraph op that is not an input to ops in the subgraph\r\n- updated subgraph & graph pass READMEs\r\n- Added error messaging from external library\r\n\r\n### Extra Inputs for Subgraph Ops ###\r\nThis feature is enabled by combining the custom partitioner and custom graph pass features. We leverage the custom graph partitioner to create the subgraph op and perform regular partitioning. Then, leverage a custom graph pass to find the newly created subgraph ops and add extra inputs.\r\n\r\nThe \"lib_subgraph\" example in example/extensions/lib_subgraph has been extended to optionally add extra inputs to the subgraph op. It shows finding the subgraph nodes that were created during partitioning, and adding extra inputs. Heres a snippet (but I encourage you to go look at the code change in subgraph_lib.cc):\r\n```\r\nGraph *g = Graph::fromString(in_graph);\r\n//find node with '_custom_subgraph_op' op type\r\nfor(Node* n : g->nodes) {\r\n  if(n->op.compare(\"_custom_subgraph_op\") == 0) {\r\n    //set extra input\r\n    n->attrs[MX_STR_EXTRA_INPUTS] = std::to_string(1);\r\n\r\n    // ... create a new node in the graph, write it up to the subgraph node ...\r\n\r\n    // add a corresponding tensor for this input\r\n    new_node.alloc_arg({1},MXContext::CPU(0),kFloat32);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nModifying the `Graph` object updates the symbol, and calling the `alloc_arg` creates a tensor that will be added to the params for the model. \r\n\r\n### Custom Subgraph Op Enhancements ###\r\nAdded new custom lambda functions for subgraph ops instead of using default `DefaultSubgraphOp*` from src/operator/subgraph/common.h. These functions \"hide\" the extra inputs to the subgraph op from processing for inferring shapes, types, storage types for the ops inside the subgraph. This is configured via the `MX_STR_EXTRA_INPUTS` attribute that can be set on subgraph ops.\r\n\r\n### Gluon API Changes ###\r\nPreviously hybridize used to clear the `cachedOp` and `cached_graph` on every call. In this PR we add a new argument `clear` that defaults to `True` to preserve current behavior. When set to `False` it allows re-using the previous `cached_graph` to chain multiple optimization calls together. Heres an example:\r\n```\r\nnet = nn.SymbolBlock(sym, inputs)\r\nnet.optimize_for(x, backend=\"opt1\")\r\nnet.optimize_for(x, backend=\"opt2\", clear=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Graph Pass Enhancements ###\r\nRaises the level of abstraction for custom graph pass writers by adding a `Graph` class to represent the symbol graph. Builds on top of the JSON support. Enables users to easily add/remove nodes in the graph, connect/disconnect nodes, modify attributes, and add new args/aux, etc. At a high level, this means modifying operators, fusing operators (ie. replacing Conv, BN, Act chains with a custom op), fusing params, etc. All conversion from JSON string to Graph object and back is now built-in. Users can just use the Graph object directly. Heres an example:\r\n```\r\nMXReturnValue addInputPass(Graph *g,\r\n\t\t\t   const std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>& options) { \r\n  // ... do custom graph pass ...\r\n\r\n  return MX_SUCCESS;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHeres an example adding a new node in the graph and then allocating a new arg param for it:\r\n```\r\nNode *n = g->addNode(\"myNode\",\"null\");\r\nn->alloc_arg({1},MXContext::CPU(0),kFloat32);\r\n```\r\nHeres an example creating an edge between two nodes:\r\n```\r\nn1->outputs[0] = {n2,1};\r\nn2->inputs[1] = {n1,0};\r\n```\r\nHere node `n1` produces an output at index 0 that is consumed by node `n2` on the input at index 1.\r\n![example_nodes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1541993/88966633-7aac6300-d261-11ea-80de-ae3490640ff7.png)\r\n\r\n### JSON parsing enhancements ###\r\nRemoved the JsonParser class and refactored the parsing functions into the JsonVal class as static function. Before you used to do this to parse a string into a JSON object:\r\n```\r\nJsonParser parser;\r\nJsonVal json_val = parser.parse_to_json(subgraph_sym);\r\n```\r\nAnd now you can just call the static function:\r\n```\r\nJsonVal json_val = JsonVal::parse(subgraph_sym);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test changes ###\r\nRefactors `test_subgraph.py` and removes the old `Symbol.bind` uses now that they are deprecated in 2.0. \r\n\r\n### Error messaging ###\r\nAdded support to enable returning custom error messages from external library API calls. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"test_subgraph.py\", line 35, in <module>\r\n    mx.library.load(path)\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/subgraph_inputs/python/mxnet/library.py\", line 56, in load\r\n    check_call(_LIB.MXLoadLib(chararr, mx_uint(verbose_val)))\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/subgraph_inputs/python/mxnet/base.py\", line 246, in check_call\r\n    raise get_last_ffi_error()\r\nmxnet.base.MXNetError: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/subgraph_inputs/src/c_api/c_api.cc\", line 1465\r\nMXNetError: Library failed to initialize\r\nExtension Traceback:\r\n\tsubgraph_lib.cc[329]: MXNet version 20000 not supported by custom library\r\n```\r\nNotice the new *Extension Traceback* at the bottom. On the user-side, a new macro simplifies adding error messages:\r\n```\r\nMX_ERROR_MSG << \"MXNet version \" << version << \" not supported by custom library\" << std::endl;\r\n```\r\nUsers can enqueue multiple error messages by using `MX_ERROR_MSG` multiple times. Error messages are printed when returning `MX_FAIL` from any extension API (ie. `initialize`, `supportedOps`, etc that return an `MXReturnValue`).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

Description ##\r\nFixes #18765\r\nWhen the script terminates, the threads in the engine are still free to execute ops. If those ops use `static` variables they may already be destroyed by the time a thread tries to access them, which causes a segfault.\r\n\r\nPreviously there was a little bit of protection against it by setting `shutdown_phase_` in the engine and not executing new ops when it was set. However, if the op takes a long time, it is possible for it to already be inside the op, therefore still triggering the segfault. \r\n\r\n@leezu @eric-haibin-lin @szha \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

Description ##\r\nI recently ran into a CI failure in test_numpy_interoperability.py::test_np_array_function_protocol: http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/mxnet-validation%2Fwindows-cpu/detail/PR-18694/14/pipeline.  I was not able to use the  reported seed for the failure to reproduce it.  I have investigated why and am supplying this PR as a fix- now reported seeds can be used to repro failures.  I was then able to use the new facility to troubleshoot which tests needed loosened tolerances for increased test robustness, and have supplied that as well- the failure rate I estimate now is around 1:10000.\r\n\r\nAs a review, the robustness of a test should be able to be explored with:\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_COUNT=10000 pytest --verbose -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG <my_test>\r\n<see a failure, note failure seed NNN>\r\nMXNET_TEST_SEED=NNN pytest --verbose -s <my_test>\r\n```\r\nThe issue with test_numpy_interoperability.py was that it was creating a test workload at file import time using unseeded random values.  The fix makes the workload be regenerated for each test at test runtime in a manner that will depend on the seed of the test.\r\n\r\nThe two tests that required loosened tolerances were linalg.tensorinv and linalg.solve.  At the setting as I left them, I saw 1 failure in 10K trials.  Rather than loosening the tolerances further, I will leave it to the code owners to diagnose the situation and propose a fix if they see fit to.  The tolerances could be loosened further, but other approaches could involve changing the scale or other properties of the input data.  The remaining failure can (after the PR is merged) be repro'd with:\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_SEED=801992040 pytest --verbose -s tests/python/unittest/test_numpy_interoperability.py::test_np_array_function_protocol\r\n```\r\nA curious property of the remaining failure is that so many of the values are consistently smaller than the golden copy by 1.9%:\r\n```\r\nDispatch test: linalg.tensorinv\r\n\r\n*** Maximum errors for vector of size 3600:  rtol=0.01, atol=0.005\r\n\r\n  1: Error 1.934343  Location of error: (1, 1, 0,

Then X = QU and get X_grad by applying the gradient derivation from the square input case (m=n) with adjusted Q_grad. Also get Y_grad separately. Then A_grad is the concatenation of X_grad and Y_grad.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] qr backward wide input\r\n- [x]

Description ##\r\nDisabling this test for now to unblock other PRs, while I'm looking into it.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18740\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-17T01:25:29Z","updated_at":"2020-07-17T17:27:45Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T17:27:44Z","merged_at":"2020-07-17T17:27:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e0df1b98faa0e83f06118b6d2f5957a28d9f2c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18741/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18741/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18741/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c4e4219218001a217e1a9a232a1d9c08aeff9b17","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:sparse-bug","ref":"sparse-bug","sha":"c4e4219218001a217e1a9a232a1d9c08aeff9b17","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
