I am not sure if it's because they are instantiated in a different way. However, I was able to get the error to be raised by adding the following code to def partial() in baseoperator.py.\r\n```\r\nif partial_kwargs[\"pool_slots\"] < 1:\r\n    dag_str = f\" in dag {partial_kwargs['dag'].dag_id}\" if partial_kwargs[\"dag\"] else \"\"\r\n    raise ValueError(f\"pool slots for {partial_kwargs['task_id']}{dag_str} cannot be less than 1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am working on investigating whether this is the correct approach or whether this code should be executed when the task is instantiated like it is for a regular task. I'm not sure if mapped tasks using partial() are purposely designed to be instantiated differently or if they should pass through some of the same checks as a regular task upon instantiation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if modifying def partial() is the way to go, I might have to modify the expand() method in the _TaskDecorator class as well.\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

I am starting to build a PoC and experience code in  and for AIP-69 I realized that provider packages from the mono-repo do not load plugins when starting the system via breeze. Plugins are correctly published via entry-point definition if packages are released but are missing in the global pyproject.toml. Mainly also because they should not be contained there.\r\n\r\nFollowing a Slack discussion in https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/C06K9Q5G2UA/p1715545743922549 with @potiuk I attempted and succeeded in extending the `hatch_build.py`. With this PR the plugins defined in the provider packages are dynamically extended for the development setup, means that when starting Airflow with breeze, the included \"hive\" and \"openlineage\" plugin are loaded by default. (Any maybe if Romte Executor will bring nother also this...\r\n\r\nHow to test?\r\n- Use the branch and start Airflow with `breeze start-airflow --answer y`\r\n- In the tmux started run `airflow plugins` and see hive and openlineage are added from source automatically.\r\n\r\nNote: Needed to extend the \"provider_dependencies.json\" to have the plugin information contained there as well as hatch loads the other details from there as well. First wanted to start another second JSON... but actually the provider dependencies is not cleanly a dependency, so added it there.\r\n\r\n@mobuchowski FYI needed to adjust pytest as the openlineage provider plugin is now loaded before pytest and module needs to be un-loaded to make fixture for config working. This replaces the module-unloading post test.","created_at":"2024-05-20T21:47:15Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T18:39:40Z","closed_at":"2024-05-24T13:41:58Z","merged_at":"2024-05-24T13:41:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"c9c352d0dd2370ce39fc978b4255b6b507f1fbc6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mobuchowski","id":6503007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDMwMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6503007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski","html_url":"https://github.com/mobuchowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mobuchowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

I have had to add a new button on the home page to view all states:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"646\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/41503039/6ac8c577-eb42-4250-b874-29e2180bdd2f\">\r\n\r\nI've had to add a few SQL queries to ensure that the number next to each label is correct. Without them, if a DAG has multiple running DAG Runs, it counts them all. For example: we have 1 DAG with 3 running DAG runs --> without the new queries, a (3) appears, instead of a (1).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the numbers next to the label may seem strange at first, since they change continuously according to the applied filters.\r\n\r\nI initially thought of making this work as the TAGs filter, but it is nice to see the count next to the label.\r\n\r\n@PApostol since you developed this initially: what do you think?

#39693\r\n\r\nSpecial logic was added to `KubernetesPodOperator`'s lifecycle to handle the case where an istio proxy sidecar is running and preventing the pod from completing, but this logic should have been applied more generally to handle when multiple containers are ran in the pod. The new behavior considers the pod completed if the container matching the base name has completed.\r\n\r\nThe istio-specific logic has been removed because it is no longer used.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

But the previous implementation only accepted `list[tuples]` and `list[Any]` which is wrong. Hence the dag is breaking as the previous client accepted `list[list[float]]` as well. I have added a transformation method to fix this.\r\n\r\nI have tested this DAG with the change.\r\n<img width=\"1723\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-17 at 9 10 51 PM\"

- Renamed the file to example_bedrock_retrieve_and_generate.py, a more accurate and descriptive name\r\n - Added an example for invoking Claude models and added that to the docs\r\n \r\nThe Claude models have two different APIs that can be called (Messages and Completions) based on the format of the input_data, which is why the new example is phrased the way it is.  Messages API is intended for multiple back-and-forth conversation like a chatbot so my example uses the Completions API format.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

We should avoid this.\r\n\r\nAirflow < 3.0 should raise a warning, and from Airflow 3.0, we can make errors by default. We can have a feature flag to allow users who want to see this in advance to enable errors in Airflow 2. x, but this should not be the default behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe DAGs should continue working on Airflow 2.x minor/micro releases without errors (unless the user opts in via configuration).\r\n\r\n# How to reproduce\r\n\r\nBy running the following DAG with `apache-airflow==2.9.1` and `apache-airflow-providers-postgres==5.11.0`, as an example:\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.datasets import Dataset\r\nfrom airflow.operators.empty import EmptyOperator\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith DAG(dag_id='empty_operator_example', start_date=datetime(2022, 1, 1), schedule_interval=None) as dag:\r\n\r\n    task1 = EmptyOperator(\r\n        task_id='empty_task1',\r\n        dag=dag,\r\n        outlets=[Dataset(\"postgres://postgres:5432/postgres.dbt.stg_customers\")]\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    task2 = EmptyOperator(\r\n        task_id='empty_task2',\r\n        dag=dag\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    task1 >> task2\r\n```\r\n\r\nCauses to the exception:\r\n```\r\nBroken DAG: [/usr/local/airflow/dags/example_issue.py]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/datasets/__init__.py\", line 81, in _sanitize_uri\r\n    parsed = normalizer(parsed)\r\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/providers/postgres/datasets/postgres.py\", line 34, in sanitize_uri\r\n    raise ValueError(\"URI format postgres:// must contain database, schema, and table names\")\r\nValueError: URI format postgres:// must contain database, schema, and table names\r\n```\r\n\r\n# About the changes introduced\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the following:\r\n\r\n1. A boolean configuration within `[core],` named `strict_dataset_uri_validation,` which should be `False` by default.\r\n\r\n2. When this configuration is `False,` Airflow should raise a warning saying:\r\n```\r\nFrom Airflow 3, Airflow will be more strict with Dataset URIs, and the URI xx will no longer be valid. Please, follow the expected standard as documented in XX.\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. If this configuration is `True,` Airflow should raise the exception, as it does now in Airflow 2.9.0 and 2.9.1\r\n\r\n4. From Airflow 3.0, we change this configuration to be `True` by default.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-16T14:22:31Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T10:46:15Z","closed_at":"2024-05-17T06:51:15Z","merged_at":"2024-05-17T06:51:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"a07d7994827db5b869f340037e39cb81e27a8b8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Lee-W","id":5144808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDQ4MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5144808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W","html_url":"https://github.com/Lee-W","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lee-W/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

Due to its future deprecation AutoML's URLs have been divided between Google Translation and Vertex AI services. This PR updates the operators that are going to be used only with Google Translation services. \r\n\r\nI opted to create a new module `airflow/providers/google/cloud/links/translate.py` and put the new links there instead of updating the existing AutoML links in `airflow/providers/google/cloud/links/automl.py` because:\r\n- The links are leading to Google Translation URLs anyway;\r\n- Corresponding AutoML URLs are no longer accessible and will be deprecated in the future;\r\n- There is no module for the Google Translation links yet even though Google Translation operators exist.\r\n\r\nThis PR is dependent on and should not be merged before https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38673 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

The execute method makes two client requests: the first to the BigQuery client, which can work without the location provided, the second to the Google Discovery client, which cannot find a resource without the location resulting in a error. \r\n\r\nPulling the location from a successful BigQuery request result resolves that problem.\r\n\r\nChange list: \r\n- Make BigQueryCursor use the job

The operator uses the existing `ImportTable` AWS [Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_ImportTable.html). Yet, import into existing tables is [not ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/S3DataImport.HowItWorks.html) currently supported by `ImportTable`. Until this is supported the operator uses an combination of staging first into a temporary DynamoDB table and then use `scan` to load data into the target DynamoDB table. \r\n\r\nAll related unit

Then when the connection is saved to secret cache (see [Connection.get_connection_from_secrets](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9284dc53914fc1b8b17399158de7b2c883519664/airflow/models/connection.py#L507-L512)) the connection with a normalized `conn_type` is transformed back into a URI which causes the RFC3896 warning related to underscores appearing in `conn_type`.\r\n\r\nFor example, a google-cloud-platform connection in Vault defined as a URI (where `conn_type` is `google-cloud-platform`) will generate this warning about underscores in the `conn_type` when referenced by an Airflow component.\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"conn_uri\": \"google-cloud-platform:...\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option could be to move this warning to `Connection._normalize_conn_type`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

Keep the same value if the suffix is not present.\r\n\r\nThis is needed because sometimes operators can be passed with the _parent_model_ value which contains such a suffix, for example when the user wants to extract a model id / model name from a serialized result of CreateCustomTrainingJobOperator run and then pass it to another operator as the _parent_model_. Vertex AI is not able to find a resource if it contains this suffix, and will return an error that will prevent the user from submitting a new training job. \r\n\r\nThis PR partially reverts #38417 which removed a similar functionality because it caused a bug in the cases when the parent_model did not contain any suffixes.

the dag records count gets huge, and users try to delete\r\nDAG and DAG runs that are no longer needed or are stale, it \r\nis observed that the deletion is significantly slow. The reason\r\nfor this is that the CASCADING DELETES are slow. Although,\r\nwe have foreign key constraints in the referencing tables, they\r\ndo not create an index implicitly on those columns (dag_id in \r\nthe referencing tables in this case). Hence, we're creating indexes\r\non the 5 of the 6 referencing tables for CASCADE DELETES to \r\nspeed up the deletion of records. In this PR, we're skipping to \r\nadd the index on the 6th table `dag_owner_attributes` as we're\r\nfacing a failure in the CI to find the constraint `dag.dag_id` for \r\nthat table. I plan to follow-up on the remaining 6th table it in a \r\nseparate PR. Without these indexes, it was observed that it takes \r\nmany hours to delete those records and it reduced to a few seconds \r\nafter adding those indexes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

executemany through the SQL hook using the supports_executemany parameter on the hook class or do it individually where needed, as in some cases you want to use it but in other ones not as the for

#39319 \r\n\r\nThis PR provide two minor changes :\r\n- Two additional arguments are given to the python command to match the updates of the script interface\r\n   `python3 /tmp/script.py /tmp/script.in /tmp/script.out none /tmp/script.out`\r\n   Indeed, the script used in the DockerOperator in the same as the one in PythonVirtualenvOperator (see [airflow/utils/python_virtualenv_script.jinja2](https://github.com/karunpoudel/airflow/blob/1e75b694848b1eac2fdf3a28a3052501f5470908/airflow/utils/python_virtualenv_script.jinja2) )\r\n- The messages transferred from the docker container to the worker are split line by line to the logger, in order to\r\n   - allow multiline messages such as Trace backs to maintain the indent (useful for [PEP-657](https://peps.python.org/pep-0657/) )\r\n   - Manage buffered messages that should be individually printed but could be differed\r\n   - Sherry on the cake : filtering on the message level and the file display the totality of the multi-line message (instead of only the first line)\r\n\r\n## Illustration of the multiline splits\r\n\r\nBefore :\r\n```\r\n[2024-05-14T12:51:52.701+0000]

We can't modify already released versions and provide a max supported Airflow version so we'd like to have a runtime check to ensure that a compatible version of OL provider is

Why\r\nDuring https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38674, I introduced a logic that might run user code in the scheduler [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38674/files#diff-807ca0a4fd53aeb41166621c9842b0f89b7931fc64e9a60befa36c776db45efaR1215-R1221). This PR intent to propose a new logic that could avoid this.\r\n\r\n## What\r\n* Introduce a `StartTriggerArgs` class that should contain `trigger_cls` (or maybe it could be renamed `trigger_cls_path`?), `tirgger_kwargs`, `timeout`, and `next_method`, which are what we need when we run an operator in deferrable mode.\r\n    * ~~**suggestion needed**: `airflow.models.abstractoperator` might not be the best module to put this data class but might need some suggestion~~ move it to `airflow.triggers.base` (Thanks @jedcunningham !)\r\n* Introduce a `start_from_trigger` flag to allow an operator to be executed as normal or from the triggerer\r\n\r\nOperator authors will now need to set the `start_trigger_args`, `start_from_trigger` (or maybe `start_from_triggerer`?) this one to start execution directly from the triggerer. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom datetime import timedelta\r\nfrom typing import Any\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.models.baseoperator import BaseOperator, StartTriggerArgs\r\nfrom airflow.triggers.temporal import TimeDeltaTrigger\r\n\r\n\r\nclass AsyncOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n    start_trigger_args = StartTriggerArgs(\r\n        trigger_cls=\"airflow.triggers.testing.SuccessTrigger\",\r\n        trigger_kwargs={},\r\n        next_method=\"execute_complete\",\r\n        timeout=None,\r\n    )\r\n    start_from_triggerer = True\r\n\r\n    def execute_complete(self, context, event=None) -> None:\r\n        self.log.info(\"execute complete\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the mapped operator is still not supported, but a draft PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39912 has been created.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
