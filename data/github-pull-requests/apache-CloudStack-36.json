Description\r\n\r\nIf a vm is running on non dedicated host then all the hosts\r\nwhich are dedicated for other accounts/domain should not be\r\neligible for migration.\r\n\r\nSimilarly if a vm is running on dedicated host then all the hosts\r\nwhich are only dedicated for this account/domain should be\r\neligible for migration\r\n\r\nSteps to reproducde the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Dedicate a host to root/admin\r\n2. create a account test, and create a vm\r\n3. Try to migrate the vm\r\n4. Open the dialog to migrate the vm\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nThe dedicated host for root domain should be \"Not Suitable\" for migration\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nThe ui shows the \"dedicated host\" as \"Suitable\"\r\n\r\nTest cases:\r\n\r\nCreate a test account.\r\nCreate 1 vm under root domain and 1 under test domain\r\n\r\n1. Try to migrate a vm of root domain\r\n2. All hosts should be suitable for migration - PASS\r\n3. Same result for the vm of test domain - PASS\r\n\r\n1. Dedicate a different host to root domain\r\n2. Try to migrate vm of root domain\r\n3. All hosts should be suitable for migration since vm is running on\r\n   non dedicated host and the other hosts are either non dedicated\r\n   or dedicated to root domain - PASS\r\n4. Try to migrate vm of test domain. The host which was dedicated above\r\n   should be not suitable for migration as it is dedicated to different\r\n   domain - PASS\r\n\r\n1. Try to dedicate the host on which vm of root domain running to root domain\r\n2. Try to migrate the vm of root domain.\r\n3. All hosts should be not suitable since source host is dedicated and no other\r\n   hosts are dedicated -PASS\r\n4. Try to migrate vm of test domain\r\n5. All hosts except the host which is dedicated to root domain should be not\r\n   suitable for migration. - PASS\r\n\r\nDo the same above steps but with dedicating a host to test domain instead of root domain\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nIt is not common, but HTTP requests can fail due to connection issues. In order to mitigate such situations and also improve logging, this PR enhances the Redfish request handling by adding an execution flow for re-trying HTTP requests; the retry happens only if the global settings `redfish.retries` is set to 1 or more retries; default is of 2 (two). One can disable the retries by setting `redfish.retries` to 0 (zero).\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

In such cases, IOExcetions will happen on a higher frequency than any other setup due to the exception `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host terminated the handshake`.\r\n\r\nThe following log shows GET requests that failed a couple of times, the successful request happened at the third attempt:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed to execute HTTP GET request [URL: https://oob-redfish.net/redfish/v1/Systems/]. Executing the request again.\r\nRetry HTTP GET request [URL: https://oob-redfish.net/redfish/v1/Systems/], attempt 1/2.\r\nFailed to execute HTTP GET request retry attempt 1/2 [URL: https://oob-redfish.net/redfish/v1/Systems/] due to exception javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Remote host terminated the handshake\r\nRetry HTTP GET request [URL: https://oob-redfish.com/redfish/v1/Systems/], attempt 2/2.\r\nSuccessfully executed HTTP GET request [URL: https://oob-redfish.net/redfish/v1/Systems/].\r\nRetrieved System ID 'System.Embedded.1' with request 'GET: https://oob-redfish.com/redfish/v1/Systems/'\r\nRetrieved System power state 'On' with request 'GET: https://oob-redfish.com/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** Ignoring SSL is not ideal but the redfish out-of-band driver works fine in such case (we have been using it for a couple of months already). However, SSLHandshakeException (_grandchild_ class of IOException) exceptions can be thrown. Nonetheless, ADMINS should have the freedom to still use Refish requests in such cases therefore it was and it has been working OK.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\nService Offering allows ADMINs to set multiple parameters such as IOPS, memory, and CPU; however, we still are not able to configure the Root Disk size of a VM via service Offering.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds control over the Root disk size and therefore helps providers that want to enforce the root disk size in the same way that it is done with compute offering.\r\n\r\n**How does it work?**\r\n- If the Service Offering is created without setting root disk size, all operations over root volume size are done as currently.\r\n- If a Service Offering is created with a root disk size, then there are some (intentionally) limitations under the root disk size resizing, as the following ones:\r\n```\r\n1. Users cannot deploy VMs with custom root disk size when using such offerings\r\n2. Users cannot resize the VM root disk size when using such offerings\r\n3. the Root Volume of such VMs can only be resized when changing to another Service Offering with a Root disk size equals or larger than the current one.\r\n4. Users can change the VM offering to a service offering with a Root size of 0GB (default), and then customize the volume size.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo easily view all possible service offering resizing, the following table shows if such offering migration is supported:\r\n\r\n| # | Service Offering Root size | new Service Offering Root | Does support offering resize? |\r\n|---|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\r\n| 1 | 0GB (default)              | Any                       | YES                           |\r\n| 2 | 5GB                        | 5GB                       | YES                           |\r\n| 3 | 5GB                        | 10GB                      | YES                           |\r\n| 4 | 10GB                       | 5GB                       | NO                            |\r\n| 5 | Any                        | 0GB                       | YES                           |\r\n\r\n**How users can resize the root volume if the VM was deployed with a Root disk size configured via its Service offering?**\r\n- Users/Admins can at any time change to an offering with the default root disk size of 0; on such case, then it would be possible to resize as it is done nowadays.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nVMware code keeps a cache of existing VMs on a hypervisor host using `cloud.vm.internal.name` property of the VM. Searching for unmanaged instances/VMs on a host might not return an expected result when this property differs from the actual name of the VM.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n- Deploy a VM in vCenter\r\n- Set custom attribute for the VM with key = `cloud.vm.internal.name` and value = `Anything different than VM name`\r\n- listUnmanagedInstance API fails when `name` parameter with name of the VM\r\n- importUnmanagedInstance API fails for the VM\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nWith this commit, listUsageRecords filters out usages made on IP addresses on networks with \"Hide IP Address Usage\". This was previously introduced in #3235.\r\n\r\nThis requires a DB schema change, to introduce a flag `is_hidden` in table `cloud_usage.cloud_usage`.\r\n\r\nCf. #4193\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nMultiple IP addresses have been created.\r\n- Those on shared networks without \"Hide IP Address Usage\" generate usages normally;\r\n- Those on shared networks with \"Hide IP Address Usage\" generate usages with flag `is_hidden`, and are not returned by the API.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-14T16:11:14Z","updated_at":"2020-11-10T10:59:06Z","closed_at":"2020-11-07T09:42:45Z","merged_at":"2020-11-07T09:42:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f8289ffe90fd829493bf4e0d23c64ef50313627","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"GabrielBrascher","id":5025148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5025148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBrascher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:bug","name":"type:bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":""},{"id":589135275,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODkxMzUyNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:usage-server","name":"component:usage-server","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":916085075,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTYwODUwNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:database","name":"component:database","color":"2CFACC","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1663969521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjYzOTY5NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:Major","name":"Severity:Major","color":"903636","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/12","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/12","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/12/labels","id":4965208,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDk2NTIwOA==","number":12,"title":"4.15.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"andrijapanicsb","id":45762285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzYyMjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45762285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb","html_url":"https://github.com/andrijapanicsb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":242,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-31T11:55:38Z","updated_at":"2021-01-11T08:58:34Z","due_on":"2020-12-24T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-01-11T08:58:34Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/4327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/4327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/4327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/db65fbdc36180d45a1e0705b7848be1dc99c0431","head":{"label":"apalia:hide_ip_address_usages","ref":"hide_ip_address_usages","sha":"db65fbdc36180d45a1e0705b7848be1dc99c0431","user":{"login":"apalia","id":77301595,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc3MzAxNTk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77301595?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia","html_url":"https://github.com/apalia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apalia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com

handle edge cases of upgrades and when legacy UI is used along with\r\nPrimate or any UI sharing cookies.

Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. Logout and create a fake sessionkey cookie using `$.cookie('sessionkey', '123')`\r\n2. Try to login, login will fail and in the request two sessionkey cookies will be seen passed: \r\n![Screenshot from 2020-09-14 15-23-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95203/93077577-a1eeb080-f6a6-11ea-97d1-ef0b989342ca.png)\r\n\r\nWith the fix, when logout is called the API will clear sessionkey cookie (which is httponly so only the backend/server can remove it); and login works. This will cover issues after upgrades and when using legacy UI with Primate:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-09-14

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen a worker VM is created in the process of creating a volume snapshot on Vmware, the hardware version of the worker VM will be set to the highest supported hardware version of the hypervisor. If you have hypervisors of different versions in a cluster and have set the \"Default VM compatibility\" to a lower version, the worker VM should use the same version as the original VM instance,\r\n\r\nThis PR sets the worker VM hardware version to the same version as the original VM instance.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nCreation of templates from detached data disks results in a Null Pointer Exception on VMWare, as it expects the volume to be attached to a VM.\r\nTo fix this behavior and make it consistent with other hypervisors, creation of the template from the volume in case not attached to a VM is facilitated by creating a worker VM, attaching the disk to the worker VM, creating the template from it, and then destroying the VM.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Create / Upload a volume\r\n2. Attach the volume to a VM\r\n3. Detach the volume\r\n4. Initiate template creation from the volume\r\n\r\nFails with following exception:\r\n```\r\n2020-08-14 07:05:00,157 DEBUG [c.c.r.ResourceLimitManagerImpl] (API-Job-Executor-15:ctx-691a4a4c job-86

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nAfter a few hours running with InfluxDB configured, CloudStack hangs due to OutOfMemoryException raised. The exception happens at [com.cloud.server.StatsCollector.writeBatches(StatsCollector.java:1510)](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/1da76d27f13e045ac88e6c494d604d6133486c9c/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/server/StatsCollector.java#L1510):\r\n```\r\n2020-08-12 21:19:00,972 ERROR [c.c.s.StatsCollector] (StatsCollector-6:ctx-0a4cfe6a) (logid:03a7ba48) Error trying to retrieve host stats\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread\r\n        ...\r\n        at org.influxdb.impl.BatchProcessor.<init>(BatchProcessor.java:294)\r\n        at org.influxdb.impl.BatchProcessor$Builder.build(BatchProcessor.java:201)\r\n        at org.influxdb.impl.InfluxDBImpl.enableBatch(InfluxDBImpl.java:311)\r\n        at com.cloud.server.StatsCollector.writeBatches(StatsCollector.java:1510)\r\n        at com.cloud.server.StatsCollector$AbstractStatsCollector.sendMetricsToInfluxdb(StatsCollector.java:1351)\r\n        at com.cloud.server.StatsCollector$HostCollector.runInContext(StatsCollector.java:522)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Context on InfluxDB Batch:** Enabling batch on InfluxDB is great and speeds writing but it requires caution to avoid Zombie threads.\r\n\r\n**Solution:** This happens because the batching feature creates an internal thread pool that needs to be shut down explicitly; therefore, it is important to add: `influxDB.close()`.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n- The `OutOfMemoryException` happens in less than 10 hours on the staging environment.\r\n- After patching the proposed fix on the same test environment with the same workload I spend a week waiting and the exception was not thrown. All looking good with memory consumption.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nOn [PR#2848](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2848) the author added the method `preStorageMigrationStateCheck` that will check tags when the operator runs `migrateVirtualMachine` command. We do not need this kind of check, because when running migrations, the operator must have the ability to migrate volumes to the destination pool, and assuming the risk/responsibilities of migrations to different QoS primary storage systems as proposed and implemented in [Fix limitation on tag matching in 'migrateVolume' with disk offering replacement](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2636)\r\nTherefore, this PR removes the unnecessary method and permits the operator to run migrate commands without any kind of tags check, as it should be.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nIf a VM gets consecutive migrations, a null pointer exception is thrown because these VMs do not have `host_id` or` last_host_id`; ACS clears these fields when the first migration is over.\r\nWith that in mind, this PR prevents the respective null pointer. Additionally, it logs the right context and gives some information to the operator.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen executing request [assignVirtualMachine](https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.14/apis/assignVirtualMachine.html) with null `domainID` and a valid `projectID` then a `NullPointerException` happens at [DomainChecker.java](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/bb73bedb5511880c91abaa409462ba879cb0d7b7/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/acl/DomainChecker.java#L109).\r\n\r\nCommand example:\r\n```\r\nassign virtualmachine virtualmachineid=vmID projectid=projectID account=admin\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `NullPointerException` that is thrown at `DomainChecker` is handled at [AssignVMCmd.java#L142](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/bb73bedb5511880c91abaa409462ba879cb0d7b7/api/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/api/command/admin/vm/AssignVMCmd.java#L142), resulting in the following log message: `Failed to move vm null`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**My question is:** does it make sense to assign VM to a project with `domainID=null`? If so, then the handling should be different. However, I think that it should not be `null` and therefore I added a proper log message.\r\n\r\nPrior to commit \r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n### [Update November 2021] PR Scope changed\r\nConsidering the reviews and discussion, I changed the scope of this PR to documentation update. I think that at least the documentation changes are mandatory as the documentation is not clear and already let to some internal issues.\r\n\r\nLooking into the [listVirtualMachines API command documentation](https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.14/apis/listVirtualMachines.html) there is the following description:\r\n\r\n> listall: If set to false, list only resources belonging to the command's caller; if set to true - list resources that the caller is authorized to see. Default value is false\r\n\r\nThe documentation is clear about the fact that when parameter `listall=true` then `listVirtualMachines` lists resources that the caller is authorized to see. Therefore, this PR considers that the ADMIN is _authorized to see_ all VMs, including those on projects.\r\n\r\nFixes: #4267\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nRecently I had a few DB connection/transaction issues on a test environment and one of the log messages was the following `NullPointerException`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2020-08-12 22:48:33,250 WARN  [c.c.a.m.AgentManagerImpl] (AgentManager-Handler-1:null) (logid:) Caught: \r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n        at com.cloud.utils.db.GenericDaoBase.update(GenericDaoBase.java:853)\r\n        at com.cloud.utils.db.GenericDaoBase.update(GenericDaoBase.java:809)\r\n        at com.cloud.utils.db.GenericDaoBase.update(GenericDaoBase.java:1365)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking further we can see that the null pointer was caused due to a null Object calling _equals_ method. A simple fix would be to use the static final not-null Object calling the `Object.equals` method.\r\n\r\nThis PR also extracted the duplicated code that could cause `NullPointerException` and added unit tests to ensure that no `NullPointerException` will be thrown.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nAdding the Os Type Id to the CloudStack Api response for listUsageRecords for running and allocated VMs. When attempting to determine what type of VM was being used for a removed VM, the listVirtualMachines Api will not return a result, as the record has been marked removed. For our purposes, the type of OS is still required for usage purposes. This change simply adds that additional element to the output.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nWith this commit [Fix limitation on tag matching in 'migrateVolume' with disk offering](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/commit/756a7e89cbcec7a1aa98b3f470cbdf8181af75ad) the author changed the volume migrate API to allow operators to override the volume placement. Moreover, the tag validation would only happen if the operator changes the disk offering. However, further, but with this commit [Vmware offline migration](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/commit/b363fd49f70ac2092ebe6226a72a3d911dc99e1f),  cloudstack started to validate the tags again when the operator executes the volume migrate command without. This broke the override mechanism that has been previously introduced into ACS.\r\n\r\nIf the operator wants to migrate volumes, without changing the disk offering, we don't need to check if the tag match with the storage pool tag. As discussed merged in the past, the operator should be able to override the disk placement (without changing the disk offering). So this PR removes this unnecessary check for tags preventing `Unexpected exception while executing MigrateVolumeCmd`.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviors, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\nTo reproduce this error is necessary:\r\n* DO: a disk offering with tag 'A';\r\n* SP1: a Storage pool with tag 'A';\r\n* SP2: a Storage pool with tag 'B';\r\n* Create a volume using 'DO' disk offering, this will be allocated at SP1;\r\n* Try to migrate this volume to SP2\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nI reproduced this in a production environment that had been upgraded from 4.9 to 4.11 and then to 4.13.  \r\n\r\nIf the environment has `data centers` and `VLANs` removed, sends an API request with the command `listPublicIpAddress` and allocatedOnly=false we can see this error:\r\n```\r\n2020-07-29 08:15:16,224 ERROR [c.c.a.ApiServer]

because `ManagementService.searchForIPAddresses` returns IP addresses from those deleted `data centers`. And then we have a Null Pointer exception when building the `createIPAddressResponse`.  \r\nThis PR prevents this null pointer exception by doing an `INNER_JOIN` with `data_center` table were `removed` is null.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nFixes #4218 \r\n\r\nIf a host is removed from cloudstack, it will be\r\nadded back if we restart the agent service on\r\nthe host. It should not be added back if manualy\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nProvide a global setting \"add.host.on.service.restart\" with\r\ndefault value of true. If set to false, the zoneid,\r\nclusterid and podid in agent.properties will be set to\r\nnull so that when service is restarted, the agent is not\r\nadded back\r\n\r\nIf true these values will not be set to null so that it\r\ncan be still added back on service restart\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nThe SSL engine defaults to \"Server mode\" when doing handshaking. This PR removes the check on the mode which was causing tests to fail.\r\n\r\nThis behavior was changed in OpenJDK 11.0.8\r\n```\r\nJDK-8245077: Default SSLEngine Created in Server Role\r\n=====================================================\r\nIn JDK 11 and later, `javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine` by default used client\r\nmode when handshaking.  As a result, the set of default enabled\r\nprotocols may differ to what is expected. `SSLEngine` would usually be\r\nused in server mode. From this JDK release onwards, `SSLEngine` will\r\ndefault to server mode. The\r\n`javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine.setUseClientMode(boolean mode)` method may be\r\nused to configure the mode.\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nThe SSL engine defaults to \"Server mode\" when doing handshaking. This PR removes the check on the mode which was causing tests to fail.\r\n\r\nThis behavior was changed in OpenJDK 11.0.8\r\n```\r\nJDK-8245077: Default SSLEngine Created in Server Role\r\n=====================================================\r\nIn JDK 11 and later, `javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine` by default used client\r\nmode when handshaking.  As a result, the set of default enabled\r\nprotocols may differ to what is expected. `SSLEngine` would usually be\r\nused in server mode.
