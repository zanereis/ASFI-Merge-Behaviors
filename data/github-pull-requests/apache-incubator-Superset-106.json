This PR split `nativeFilters -> filtersState` to next subdomains:\r\na. `nativeFilters`: save data for native filters itself\r\nb. `crossFilters`: save filter for cross filters functionality\r\nc. `ownFilters` every chart can save here custom data (like table plugin BE pagination: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/959)\r\n\r\n2. Re-trigger chart rendering if `own` `extraFormData` changed for some specific chart\r\n3.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently test coverage metrics in Superset do not enforce a minimum level of test coverage for the project. They are also not particularly accurate, as the metric percentages include files that do not normally receive test coverage, such as migrations. While I would love to add test coverage for database migrations in the future, for now I believe we should exclude them as well as any other files that are not currently intended to receive tests from coverage reports. This will give us a stable coverage metric that we can begin to enforce (after appropriate discussion in the community, of course).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis change will evaluate `configOverrides` as templates. This allows making those overrides dynamic and use input values from `values.yaml` which may not be easy to ingest as env variables. For instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfigOverrides:\r\n   reports: |\r\n    WEBDRIVER_BASEURL = \"http://{{ template \"superset.fullname\" . }}:{{ .Values.service.port }}/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n* Update your `values.yaml` with some values based on Helm values - see example above\r\n* `helm upgrade` your chart release\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional kubernetes `Deployment` to run the Celery beat, which is needed in order to trigger the scheduled alerts and reports (as per the excellent unpublished guide at https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/4fa3b6c7185629b87c27fc2c0e5435d458f7b73d/docs/src/pages/docs/installation/email_reports.mdx).\r\n\r\nIt is off by default, and needs to be enabled with `supersetBeat.enabled`.\r\n\r\nThe new pod is defined pretty much exactly like the worker pod except that:\r\n* `replicas` is always 1, since this needs to be a singleton\r\n* The command is different\r\n\r\nNote that for the chart to be able to execute reports, we still need to check all the other boxes, in particular:\r\n\r\n* Make sure one webdriver is installed - for this, the commands mentioned in the guide above can be added as a custom `supersetWorker.command` (this is only needed in the worker container) with the existing chart, with something like this in your `values.yaml`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsupersetWorker:\r\n  command:\r\n    - /bin/sh\r\n    - -c\r\n    - |\r\n      # Install chrome webdriver\r\n      # See https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/4fa3b6c7185629b87c27fc2c0e5435d458f7b73d/docs/src/pages/docs/installation/email_reports.mdx\r\n      apt update\r\n      wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\r\n      apt install -y --no-install-recommends ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb\r\n      wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/88.0.4324.96/chromedriver_linux64.zip\r\n      unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip\r\n      chmod +x chromedriver\r\n      mv chromedriver /usr/bin\r\n      apt autoremove -yqq --purge\r\n      apt clean\r\n      rm -f google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb chromedriver_linux64.zip\r\n\r\n      # Run\r\n      . {{ .Values.configMountPath }}/superset_bootstrap.sh; celery --app=superset.tasks.celery_app:app worker\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Perform all the required Celery setup by overriding the `superset_config.py`. This is now possible with the latest chart from `master` by specifying overrides in your `values.yaml` such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfigOverrides:\r\n  celery_conf: |\r\n    from celery.schedules import

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFixes #13099 \r\n\r\n`FilterBox` will send empty string as filter values when a column's `defaultValue` is empty string, causing no-results for filtered charts.\r\n\r\nThe default value for filter column's `defaultValue` is `null`, but if users have edited it, it will be updated to an empty string. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/107862149-8fb4a200-6dff-11eb-9009-3b57e249b227.png\" width=\"500\">\r\n\r\nThis empty string is then propagated to `extra_filters` of the affected charts. This PR will treat empty strings as `null` when constructing filter values for the dashboard.\r\n\r\nThis is the preferred fix because there may be existing `FilterBox` charts already have `defaultValue: \"\"` saved in their metadata.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nSee  #13099 how to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Manual verification following steps in #13099\r\n2. Added a unit test \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nPreviously, SuperSet was able to access Presto through the PyHive, even though it's not the official python driver, as well as it is not in active development. However, since Dec 27, 2020, [**PrestoSQL was renamed to Trino**](https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html), this mean you can't using PyHive to access Trino any more.   \r\nSo this MR is first step native support Trino using [official python driver](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCloses #13067 \r\n\r\n#13079   upgraded `package-lock.json` to npm 7 format (`lockfileversion: 2`), which breaks the current workflow with `npm link` (although #13058 has downgraded it to `lockfileversion: 1` again):\r\n\r\n1. Now you have to manually run `npm install` in each package you linked\r\n2. A simple `npm install` will fail because of peer dependency resolution. You should use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` until we resolve the peer dependency conflicts (seems solvable by upgrading to React 17). \r\n\r\nInstead of reverting, let's see what else we need to do to make the Superset codebase work with npm 7.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the following:\r\n\r\n1. Lock package.json [`engines`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#engines) to npm 7\r\n2. Upgrade Superset UI packages to the latest, including `@superset-ui/legacy-plugin-chart-map-box` which was left out of recent upgrades for a while... This brings in a couple of new commits in Superset UI:\r\n    https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/compare/v0.17.8...v0.17.9\r\n    which adds a \"sort by metric\" checkbox for charts with single metric.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nSwitching viz type between a chart type and filter was broken due to a different type of data payload (array for charts and object for filter) and additional rerender caused by dispatching `RESET_FIELDS` after render caused by switching viz type. I moved the logic of resetting control fields to `SET_FIELD_VALUE` reducer, thus removing 1 rerender.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nPart of the move towards consolidating superset front-end into a single page app, this page includes some performance improvements between page loads. \r\n\r\n- code splitting and lazy loading along react-router routes.\r\n- use react router `<Link/>` component in the navigation menu if react-router route exists\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- All pages in the app load without error\r\n- No visual changes\r\n- Menu navigating between front-end routes (eg, Charts, Dashboards, Databases, Datasets, Alerts & Reports) does not result in a full-page load. Page loads should be much faster.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/12896\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nDescribed in detail in: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13009 but described here again just for clarity.\r\n\r\nWhen previewing a table in SQL Lab, a `SELECT *` statement is generated based on table data and metadata. This particular bug occur whens previewing tables with `TIMESTAMP` partition for Presto/Trino data sources. Unlike some other databases, Presto doesn't automatically convert between varchars and other types. In particular, `TIMESTAMP` needs to be explicitly casted. The simplest way is to use the type constructor `TIMESTAMP` before the value. \r\n\r\nTherefore, `where_latest_partition` in `presto.py` needs to cast the `TIMESTAMP` when it generates the `WHERE` block in the preview table statement. Accomplish this by creating new SQLAlchemy Type which subclasses [TypeDecorator](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/custom_types.html#sqlalchemy.types.TypeDecorator) adding additional functionality to existing [TIMESTAMP](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/type_basics.html#sqlalchemy.types.TIMESTAMP) type. For each partition column, I check if the type is `TIMESTAMP`, and if it is I instantiate the custom `TimeStamp` class in the `Column` object which will call `process_bind_params` when the query compiles.\r\n\r\n**Invalid syntax** (generated by `/<int:pk>/table/<table_name>/<schema_name>/` -> `get_table_metadata` -> `select_star` -> `where_latest_partition`)\r\n```\r\npresto:events> SELECT

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR improves [current](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/11771) RTL configuration and contributes to [SIP 56](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/11688). \r\n\r\nThe changes made here aim to:\r\n\r\n### Avoid matchers conflict\r\nEnzyme matchers were conflicting with jest-dom matchers. To avoid this I moved `import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';` from `spec/helpers/setup.ts` to `spec/helpers/testing-library.tsx`. This way Enzyme matchers are the default option (99% of the tests) and we can choose to use jest-dom matchers in our RTL tests using custom render functions from `testing-library.tsx` or importing `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect` directly in each test file. \r\n\r\n### Improve user events simulation in our tests\r\nWith the use of [@testing-library/user-event](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) we have a better level of abstraction to simulate user events. Here are some examples of the new API that can be used in our tests:\r\n\r\n`click`, `dblClick`, `type`, `upload`, `clear`, `selectOptions`, `deselectOptions`, `tab`, `hover`, `unhover`, `paste`, `specialChars`\r\n\r\n### Support additional ESLint rules\r\nWith the addition of [plugin:jest-dom/recommended](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-jest-dom) to ESLint plugins list we can enforce another set of tests best practices and improve the quality of our tests. \r\n\r\nAn important side note is that ESLint wasn't working properly for some files because of this configuration problem:\r\n\r\n`Error while loading rule 'jest/no-deprecated-functions': Unable to detect Jest version - please ensure jest package is installed, or otherwise set version explicitly`\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I included a configuration option to automatically detect Jest version.\r\n\r\nAnother important point is that ESLint rules of `eslint-plugin-testing-library` are not currently working with the import of custom functions from a different library name. \r\n\r\nIn our case the rules will not be applied when using `import { render, screen } from 'spec/helpers/testing-library';`\r\n\r\nIf we use `import { render, screen } from ‚Äò@testing-library/react‚Äô;` then ESLint works. \r\n\r\nThey are aware of this [issue](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library/issues/173) and are already working on a fix in version 4.\r\n\r\n@ktmud @rusackas @geido @junlincc \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1 - Execute all tests\r\n2- They should pass \r\n\r\n1 - Execute ESLint\r\n2 - No errors should be found \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-11T17:50:32Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:42:20Z","closed_at":"2021-02-11T23:32:22Z","merged_at":"2021-02-11T23:32:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"86807e40b778495d3f5155e043fd6f61d787f17e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2709389926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzA5Mzg5OTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:migration","name":"risk:migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"High

This was fixed by bumping ECharts to the 5.0.2 version.\r\n- Custom label type changing doesn't work. This was caused by the custom label prop to be called `label_type` in the plugin but `pie_label_type` in the control panel. To fix this, the generic name was chosen (will make it easier to reuse the control value later when switching between chart types) and all references to `pie_label_type` in exising chart metadata was renamed to `label_type`.\r\n\r\nAlso updates some unrelated code that depends on changes to `superset-ui/core` that relate to native filter metadata.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nVerify that both up and down migration works, and that pie chart works properly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nA follow up for #12491 that caused problems. The ownership check is inline with the current security logic that only owners can change their object metadata.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new config flag `OLD_API_CHECK_DATASET_OWNERSHIP` that user's can set to `False` to return to the previous behaviour (no ownership checking).\r\n\r\nAlso added a deprecation warning to the MVC endpoints and `datasource/save`. Note that the new API for datasets will check for ownership and ignore `OLD_API_CHECK_DATASET_OWNERSHIP`. \r\n\r\nYet, probably the ownership concept is problematic, and a move for using associated roles to objects (dashboards, datasets, charts) is easier to manage. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe currently use a context manager to timeout queries that run in SQL Lab, eg:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith utils.timeout(seconds=timeout, error_message=timeout_msg):\r\n    data = sql_lab.get_sql_results(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe context manager uses `SIGALRM`, which is not available in Windows, resulting in an error (see https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/12824).\r\n\r\nEven though Windows is not technically supported by Superset, this is a simple fix. I introduced a new timeout context manager based on a timer.  This PR changes Superset to use that context manager only when running on Windows. In theory we could replace the old one, but I thought it would be safer to introduce the new one in parallel first.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI installed Python under a Windows VPS and tested the context manager with this script:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# test.py\r\nimport _thread\r\nimport threading\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Timeout:\r\n    def __init__(self, seconds: int = 1, error_message: str = \"Timeout\") -> None:\r\n        self.seconds = seconds\r\n        self.error_message = error_message\r\n        self.timer = threading.Timer(self.seconds, _thread.interrupt_main)\r\n\r\n    def __enter__(self) -> None:\r\n        self.timer.start()\r\n\r\n    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback) -> None:\r\n        self.timer.cancel()\r\n        if type is KeyboardInterrupt:\r\n            raise Exception(self.error_message)\r\n\r\n\r\nwith Timeout():\r\n    for i in range(int(1e15)):\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I didn't use `sleep()` because the `_thread.interrupt_main` doesn't interrupt it.)\r\n\r\nThen running it causes the main thread to be aborted after 1 second:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents>powershell -Command \"Measure-Command {python test.py}\"\r\nTraceback

SUMMARY\r\n- Adds autocopy functionality to `CopyToClipboard` (#10328)\r\n- Fixes a bug where the copying was being called twice\r\n- Changes `copyTextToClipboard` in `copy.ts` to be asynchronous and fixed promise type\r\n- Adjusts the margin of buttons that contain an icon but no text\r\n- Changes copy feedback to use notifications instead of tooltip changes\r\n\r\nI left the copy button in autocopy mode just in case the user navigates to another tab, copy some content, comes back to the application and wants to copy the link again without reopening the modal or popover.\r\n\r\n[Alert PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/12122) improves notification positioning with right and bottom margins helping the user to notice the message.\r\n\r\n@junlincc @rusackas \r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThis first POC about filters set for native filters (UI can be discussed and updated). It gives to user save set of native filters and then reuse them. In the first phase we just save it in redux as `filterSets` field of `nativeFilters`.\r\n\r\nWhen user clicks `Save filters set` it takes entire `filtersState` redux state and save it under `filterSets` redux field, and when user choose this filtersSet in dropdown it uploads this state under `filtersState` value in redux.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nFilter suggestions endpoint has a 10k limit of returned results. If there are more than 10k possible values and the searched value is at the end of the list, it will not be returned and the user won't be able to select it when using a single value operator. This PR implements a \"hack\", which creates an additional option based on current search input, thus allowing to select it.\r\n\r\nI consider this a temporary solution. Optimally, we should make the `/superset/filter/` endpoint accept a search query param and use it to filter the results. Then we can refactor `src/explore/components/controls/FilterControl/AdhocFilterEditPopoverSimpleTabContent.jsx` to send a request for suggestions when a user types a query (with some debounce for optimization).\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes the issue with warning tooltip mentioned in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13017#issuecomment-775607176.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOptimizes free-text time range filter db migration added by #12505 \r\n\r\n1. Update the validation Exception so it can be exposed to the frontend (when migration hasn't applied).\r\n2. Update the migration script so it handle cases like `100 years : 30 years ago`.  Previously it will incorrectly change it to `100 years ago : 30 years later` when it should be `100 years ago : 30 years ago`.\r\n\r\nThese are edge cases nonetheless.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nWhen opening a chart with \"100 years\" (i.e. periods without \"ago\" or \"before/after\"), it shows \"Fatal error\":\r\n\r\n<img width=\"848\" alt=\"request-is-incorret\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/107283248-fbb69500-6a10-11eb-806e-90e337ee2461.png\">\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\nThe error is more actionable:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"848\" alt=\"request-is-incorret\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/107283231-f35e5a00-6a10-11eb-9779-207b4adc251e.png\">\r\n\r\n(Still need some optimization here in order to render the backend validation error more properly but let's do it in another PR for other fields as well. Ideally the backend validation errors should come back to each control based on field name.)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n#12552 is for fixing legacy charts. You will not be able to add bad data anymore because of the backend validation. You'd need to either find a legacy bad chart, or manually add one. A quick way to do it is this:\r\n\r\n1. Connect to your Superset db using any database manager\r\n\r\nFor example I use `psql`:\r\n\r\n```\r\npsql \"postgresql://superset:superset@127.0.0.1:5432/superset_test\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run following SQL command:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO\r\n  slices (\r\n    created_on,\r\n    changed_on,\r\n    slice_name,\r\n    datasource_type,\r\n    datasource_name,\r\n    viz_type,\r\n    params,\r\n    perm,\r\n    datasource_id\r\n  )\r\nVALUES\r\n  (\r\n    '2021-01-25T13:21:40.763807',\r\n    '2021-01-25T13:21:40.763807',\r\n    'Test time period',\r\n    'table',\r\n    null,\r\n    'table',\r\n    '{ \"compare_lag\": \"10\", \"compare_suffix\": \"o10Y\", \"country_fieldtype\": \"cca3\", \"entity\": \"country_code\", \"granularity_sqla\": \"year\", \"groupby\": [ \"country_name\" ], \"limit\": \"25\", \"markup_type\": \"markdown\", \"metrics\": [ \"sum__SP_POP_TOTL\" ], \"row_limit\": 50000, \"show_bubbles\": true, \"time_range\": \"100 years : 30 years ago\", \"time_range_endpoints\": [ \"inclusive\", \"exclusive\" ], \"viz_type\": \"table\" }',\r\n    '[examples].[wb_health_population](id:2)',\r\n    2\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote we set the time range to be `\"100 years : 30 years ago\"`\r\n\r\n4. Find the ID of the chart you just inserted:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM slices\r\nWHERE slice_name like 'Test time period'\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Go to `/superset/slice/{slice_id}`\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore migration, you should see the \"Unexpected error\" when you open the chart.\r\n\r\nAfter migration, you should see the chart render correctly. \r\n\r\nNote: if you have already upgraded superset db, you need to downgrade it first:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsuperset db downgrade c878781977c6 \r\nsuperset db upgrade\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen in current master, after migration, you will also see the filter being updated to \"100 years ago : 30 years later\":\r\n\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently cascading filters evaluate truthiness of the parent filter when determining if the child filter should be rendered in place of the parent. Since the native Select filter returns an empty array for an empty selection, the parent filter is determined to be set, even though it isn't.\r\n\r\nHere we change the cascading logic so that only `undefined` and `null` are assumed to be unset. This is done because there may be other filters that have falsy values which in fact mean that the filter is set, for instance a lower range being set to `0`.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\nIn the example, I've constructed a cascading filter with \"region\" as the parent and \"country\" as the child. As can be seen, the \"country\" filter show up on the filter tab, despite the selection being empty on the \"region\" filter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/107234702-9a042400-6a2c-11eb-9dbc-5a3201d1fa70.png)\r\n\r\nAfter the change, an empty selection is set as `null`, making the parent filter display in the filter tab:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/107233815-a6d44800-6a2b-11eb-90c7-a2efb06987fc.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is continue of @agatapst PR: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/12946\r\n\r\nHere description of ‚òùÔ∏è PR:\r\n```\r\nThe aim of this PR was to create foundations for new native filters' feature: time filters.\r\nUser can choose between one more filter type, which is Time.\r\n\r\nThat's the basics for this feature. What should be added in next PRs:\r\n\r\n- UI improvements (if we want to show modal in modal, how to display very long time \"pills\" in Filter Bar etc.)\r\n- Improve Filter Config Modal validation - right now datasource is required, but in case of time filters it should not\r\n- Implement additional filtering: i.e. inverse\r\n- Might also take a look on performance - it take more time to show time filters result than select filters result\r\n- Filter indicator logic needs to be updated\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition this PR fix some edge cases.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdds a new API to get the chart definitions for a specific dashboard. This is going to support future efforts to turn Superset's frontend into a single page app by allowing removal of the Dashboard app's bootstrap data.\r\n\r\n**Alternative considered:** Using `GET` `dashboard/:id/related/slices`, and iterating over the results to fetch all the slices from `/charts/:id`. \r\n\r\nI rejected this approach because it would require changing the `/related/slices` endpoint (currently the endpoint returns the names of charts rather than ids, which is pretty useless for this purpose), and also because it would result in a large number of API requests. The chosen method of a single convenient API endpoint is much simpler.\r\n\r\nThanks to @pkdotson for pairing ‚ù§Ô∏è \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently SQL Lab is broken in Safari because the height of the `div.SqlEditor`, set to 100%, is computed as 20px (0 height + 10px vertical padding on each margin). This happens because the parent `<div>` has no height declaration, receiving a height of 0. Updating the parent `<div>` to have height 100% fixes the problem.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\nWe ran into some data accuracy issues in our environment where time range filters wouldn't apply to certain charts (like Big Number) when set on a dashboard. We determined that this was because these charts somehow didn't have a granularity param set on them, so the time range wasn't appropriately set on the chart query. This was especially dangerous, because the chart showed as applying the filter, but it wasn't actually applied to the query.\r\n\r\nThe fix is this db migration that adds the granularity param onto charts that should have one but don't.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nBefore the migration, see big number charts without the granularity or granularity_sqla param not filter by time range correctly.\r\n\r\nRun the migration, and see the dashboard perform the filter appropriately.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include
