All of the former are marked as deprecated, and their logic moved to (and implement) the latter to minimize disruption. All current serdes still implement `ComplexMetricSerde` rather than the new type, to allow anything using `ComplexMetrics.getSerdeForType` to continue functioning until their future removal, at which point the implementations shall be moved to extend `ComplexTypeSerde` directly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it adds a method to `ComplexTypeExtractor`, `coerceValue`, to use to allow `COMPLEX` types to coerce values to the appropriate type when read from a column value selector from `RowBasedColumnSelectorFactory`. This allows `COMPLEX` typed dimensions to perform value coercion, similar to the other use of the `extractValue` method when reading `COMPLEX` metrics for queries against `IncrementalIndex`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n[Issue #12359](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12359) proposes an approach to simplify and streamline integration tests, especially around the developer experience, but also for Travis. See that issue for the background.\r\n\r\nThis PR is big, but most of that comes from creating revised versions of existing files. Unfortunately, there is no good way using GitHub to compare two copies of the same file. For the most part, these are config files and you can assume that the new versions work (because, when they didn't, the cluster stubbornly refused to start or stay up.)\r\n\r\n### Developer Experience\r\n\r\nWith this framework, it is possible to:\r\n\r\n* Do a normal distribution build.\r\n* Build the Docker image in less than a minute. (Most of that is Maven determining what not to do. After the first build, you can use a script to rebuild in a few seconds, depending on what Docker must rebuild.)\r\n* Launch the cluster in a few seconds.\r\n* Debug an integration test as a JUnit test in your favorite IDE.\r\n\r\nThe result is that integration tests go from being a nightmare to being an efficient way to develop and test code changes. This author used it to create tests for [PR #12222](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12222). The process was quick and easy. Not as efficient as just using unit tests (we still want the single-process server), but still pretty good. (By contrast, the new tests were ported to the existing framework, and that is still difficult for the reasons we're trying to address here.)\r\n\r\nOne huge win is that, with this approach, one can start a Docker cluster and leave it up indefinitely to try out APIs, to create or refactor tests, etc. Though there are many details to get right to use Docker and Docker Compose, once those are addressed, using the cluster becomes quite simple and productive.\r\n\r\n### Contents of this First Cut\r\n\r\nThis PR is a first draft of the approach which provides:\r\n\r\n* A new directory, `integration-tests-ex` that holds the new integration test structure. (For now, the existing `integration-tests` is left unchanged.)\r\n* Maven module `druid-it-tools` to hold code placed into the Docker image.\r\n* Maven module `druid-it-image` to build the Druid-only test image from the tarball produced in `distribution`. (Dependencies live in their \"official\" image.)\r\n* Maven module `druid-it-cases` that holds the revised tests and the framework itself. The framework includes file-based test configuration, test-specific clients, test initialization and updated versions of some of the common test support classes.\r\n\r\nThe integration test setup is primarily a huge mass of details. This approach refactors many of those details: from how the image is built and configured to how the Docker Compose scripts are structured to test configuration. [An extensive set of \"readme\" files](https://github.com/paul-rogers/druid/blob/220325-docker/integration-tests-ex/README.md) explains those details. Rather than repeat that material here, please consult those files for explanations.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\nThis version is the result of several months of iteration to work out details around builds on various systems. The framework itself is now pretty solid, as is the Druid image. This PR includes two converted tests, and lessons from several others which are in-flight. We expect to refine the framework as we create and convert other tests.\r\n\r\nFor now, the new framework is intended to exist parallel to the current one so we experiment. The new framework is ignored unless you select the Maven profiles which enable it. (See the docs for details.) Eventually we will retire the `integration-tests` versions in favor of the `integration-tests-ex` versions, but we will do so only after the new versions are rock-solid.\r\n\r\nThere are *many* other test groups not yet touched. A good approach is to use this framework for new integration tests, and to convert old ones when someone needs to modify them. The cost of converting to this framework is low, and the productivity gain is large.\r\n\r\nOther limitations include:\r\n\r\n* The original tests appear to run not only in Docker, but also against a local QuickStart cluster and against Kubernetes. Neither of these other two modes have been tested in the new framework. (Though, it is now so easy to start and use a Docker cluster that that it may be easier to use Docker than the QuickStart cluster.)\r\n* The original tests always have security enabled. While it is important to test security, having security enabled makes debugging far harder (by design.) So, this draft has security disabled. The various scripts and configs are pulled aside. The thought is to enable security as an option when needed, and run without it when debugging things other than the security mechanism.\r\n* The supporting classes have the basics, but have been used for only the one integration test group.\r\n* This framework is not yet integrated into Travis. A test that exists only in the new framework won't run in the Travis build. We have a working version of the Travis build in a private branch, but that step will be commented out in this PR prior to merge; we'll enable Travis builds as a separate PR as we transition old tests to the new framework.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\nThis PR itself will continue to evolve as some of the final details are sorted out. However, it is at the stage where it will benefit from others taking a look and making suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe thought is that this PR is large enough already: let's get it reviewed, then tackle the additional issues listed above as the opportunity arrises and step-by-step.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nThe approach in the PR is based on the existing approach, but re-arranges the parts. Since the integration test are pretty much \"nothing but details\", there are many approaches that could be taken. Here are a few that were considered.\r\n\r\n* Run the tests as-is in an AWS instance. Because the tests are very difficult to run on a developer machine, many folks set up an AWS instance to run them. While this can work, it is slow: one has to shuffle code from the laptop to the instance and back. Or, just do development on the instance. The tests are not really set up for debugging, so even on the instance, it is still tedious to make and debug test changes.\r\n* Run the tests in Travis as part of a PR. This is the default approach. However, it is akin to the development process of old: submit the changes to a batch run, wait many hours for the answers, plow though the logs, find issues, fix them, and repeat. That process was not efficient in the era of punch cards, and is still not very efficient today. A turnaround of a minute or less is the garget, which Travis approach cannot provide.\r\n* Modify the existing integration tests. This is the obvious approach. But, the set of existing ITs is so large that attempting to change everything in one go becomes overwhelming. The chosen approach allows incremental test-by-test conversion without breaking the great mass of existing tests.\r\n* Status-quo. I'm working on a project that requires many integration tests. It is faster to fix the test framework once, and do the tests quickly, than to fight with the framework for each of the required tests.\r\n\r\nThat said, this PR is all about details. Your thoughts, suggestions and corrections are encouraged to ensure we've got our bases covered.\r\n\r\n## Detailed Changes\r\n\r\nA number of specific changes are worth calling out that do not appear in the docs.\r\n\r\n* The tests use Guice to create various Druid objects. However, they do not use the Druid extension mechanism: the tests don't have visibility to a Druid installation. Instead, any required extensions are expected to appear as normal jars on the class path. That is, they should be listed in the `pom.xml` file as dependencies.\r\n* Tests don't have access to the usual `runtime.properties` file. Instead, properties come from a new `docker.yaml` configuration file, from a binding to environment variables, or from command line options. Of these, `docker.yaml` is preferred for fixed or default properties, environment variables for properties (such as credentials) that vary per run. Avoid use of the command line as that makes test hard to debug in an IDE.\r\n* The tests use \"official\" Docker images for dependencies such as MySQL, ZooKeeper and Kafka. A solution for Hadoop is under investigation.\r\n* A custom `DruidTestRunner` provides a way to add test-specific Guice modules, along with other configuration.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nAdded Calcites InQueryThreshold as a query context parameter. Setting this parameter appropriately reduces the time taken for queries with large number of values in their IN conditions.\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This PR changes the following:\r\n- EmitClusterStatsAndMetrics is automatically added to all duty group via the constructor of the DutiesRunnable (if not already exist)\r\n-  EmitClusterStatsAndMetrics is change to check for list of duty and group name to only emits relevant metrics.\r\n- Add dutyGroup to metrics emitted from EmitClusterStatsAndMetrics indicating which dutyGroup those metrics came from.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nOriginally, this PR: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10541 tried to add a new support for WebIdentityToken, allowing Druid to authenticate to AWS S3 via EKS ServiceAccount + annotated IAM role.\r\n\r\nBut that PR doesn't work. Let me elaborate why:\r\n\r\n1. Druid master branch uses the following AWS SDK `<aws.sdk.version>1.12.37</aws.sdk.version>`, which is recent enough to be able to use WebIdentityToken to authenticate. Without doing anything, the default S3ClientBuilder should just work.\r\n\r\n2. Unfortunately, `S3InputSource.applyAssumeRole` function interferes that default behavior and does its own thing (That functionality is added by this PR: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10995). That function is triggered because `S3InputSourceConfig` somehow picked up the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` from the environment variable and inject it into the object. I have not been able to figure out how it did it.\r\n\r\nThat is what I mean by \"it doesn't work\".  \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses its issues, there are 2 of them:\r\n\r\n1. Missing aws-java-sdk-sts.jar\r\n\r\n2. applyAssumeRole function interferes with default s3Builder client behavior.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Updated `S3InputSource` and `S3InputSourceConfig`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis is a simple PR to fix the `ingest/events/messageGap` metric.\r\n\r\nIf there's a task to ingest a listless trickle of events from an upstream Kafka topic, the metrics monitor may take snapshot before starting processing events. In this case, the `messageMaxTimestamp` is unset and the `messageGap` should be the initial value (0L). Below panel shows the invalid metric data points\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1299\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-03-16 at 12 16 05\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44718283/158515789-b5823bbc-c76c-4bb9-8bd9-55941844d059.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nFor native query, binary operator(`\\`, `*`, `-`) is not supported on string expressions. If that happens, it throws exception with message as below\r\n\r\n```text\r\nunsupported type STRING\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis message is helpless for user to quickly find out where the wrong expression is especially when the native query is dynamically generated at runtime.\r\n\r\nSo this PR improves the exception message by adding the whole binary operator expression which causes this problem. For example:\r\n```\r\noperator '*' in expression (\"str1\" * \"str2\") is not supported on type of string.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSQL query has no such problem because SQL engine will cast the both operands to numbers first if the operands are not type of number.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

auto compaction by adjusting compaction task's interval to align with segmentGranularity when segmentGranularity is set\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis bug can cause data lost if segmentGranularity is set in auto compaction. \r\n\r\nIf segmentGranularity is set, then the intervals of the segments to be compacted may not align with the configured segmentGranularity. We must adjust the interval of the compaction task to fully cover and align with the segmentGranularity to prevent unexpected data lost.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n- The umbrella interval of the segments to be compacted is 2015-04-11/2015-04-12 but configured segmentGranularity is YEAR, if the compaction task's interval is 2015-04-11/2015-04-12 then we can run into race condition where after submitting the compaction task if a new segment outside of the interval (i.e. 2015-02-11/2015-02-12) got created will be lost as it is overshadowed by the compacted segment (compacted segment has interval 2015-01-01/2016-01-01). Hence, in this case, we must adjust the compaction task interval to 2015-01-01/2016-01-01.\r\n\r\n- The umbrella interval of the segments to be compacted is 2015-02-01/2015-03-01 but configured segmentGranularity is WEEK, if the compaction task's interval is 2015-02-01/2015-03-01 then compacted segments created will be 2015-01-26/2015-02-02, 2015-02-02/2015-02-09, 2015-02-09/2015-02-16, 2015-02-16/2015-02-23, 2015-02-23/2015-03-02. The compacted segment would cause existing data from 2015-01-26 to 2015-02-01 and 2015-03-01 to 2015-03-02 to be lost. Hence, in this case, we must adjust the compaction task interval to 2015-01-26/2015-03-02\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nParallel indexing with range partitioning can often cause OOM in the\r\n`ParallelIndexSupervisorTask` during the dimension distribution phase.\r\nThis typically happens because of too many `StringSketch` objects\r\nobtained from the different `partial_dimension_distribution` sub-tasks.\r\n\r\nWe need not keep any of the sketches in memory until we need to compute\r\nthe PartitionBoundaries for that interval.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Extract `StringDistribution` from `DimensionDistributionReport`s when they are received\r\n  and write to disk in the task temp directory\r\n- After all the subtasks have finished, iterate over all the intervals one by one\r\n- For each interval, read the distributions from disk, merge them and create PartitionBoundaries\r\n\r\n### Comparison\r\nFor an example dataset where each sub-task processed about 1 GB of data for the same interval, the heap usage of the `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask` is typically as below.\r\n\r\n__Before__\r\n<img width=\"874\" alt=\"before\"

Description\r\n\r\nThe `/tasks` API currently has a race condition since it sequentially executes 2 queries against the metadata store, one to find 'complete' queries and another to find 'active' queries. As a result, there could be a task that is active while the first query is running but has been finished before the second query starts. To fix the bug, this PR adds a new method in `MetadataStorageActionHandler` that returns both active and complete tasks in one transaction.\r\n\r\nThis PR also refactors `OverlordResource.getTasks()` as it is quite hard to understand.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* `TaskLookup`\r\n * `MetadataStorageActionHandler`\r\n * `TaskStorage`\r\n * `OverlordResource.getTasks`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nUtilize javaOptsArray provided as part of task context\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nImproves the performance of `FileWriteOutBytes.readFully` by using the tracked byte size added in #9722, instead of calling the channel size() method, which ends up in a native syscall to check the size of the file on disk. This `readFully` method is used by `GenericIndexedWriter.get` which is currently only used when merging spatial indexes, but would be an improvement for anything looking to read stuff out of the channel.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

(https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12318)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAs tasks increases, UI start putting a lot of stress on metadata store as its required to fetch the whole table to parse the status of the task for filtering and displaying in the UI.\r\n\r\nWe have seen an upward of 3x network throughput on our metadata store and resulting in degraded performance.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue in the UI by introducing a toggle switch that defaults to overlord for fetching task listing and thus avoiding such stress on metadata store.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar \r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-08T23:46:11Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T20:36:40Z","closed_at":"2022-03-17T20:36:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9692c49e5820abd72c3698813baa1a2fe46295df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nSupervisor auto scaler config becomes null on coordinator restart. This is because `SeekableStreamSupervisorIOConfig` has property `autoScalerConfig` but the getter is called `getAutoscalerConfig` so while serializing the property name becomes `autoscalerConfig` with small case `s` and therefore while deserialzing `autoScalerConfig` becomes `null`. This PR fixes the spelling of getter. Also added proper formatting for  `SeekableStreamSupervisorSpecTest` class.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisorIOConfig`\r\n * `KafkaSupervisorIOConfigTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

druid only supports decimal format 'k', 'm', 'g', etc...\r\nor\r\nbinary byte format 'kib', 'mib', 'gib', etc....\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with kubernetes they use the format with the decimal format + `i` only no `b` suffix for binary format. \r\n\r\nWe encountered this problem when having a volume of some size configured in helm like `500Gi`\r\nThen wanted to programatically assign the `druid.segmentCache.locations` by taking the volumeclaimtemplate's size and using it for the `maxSize` parameter.  This failed because in k8s you don't refer to it as `500GiB` instead its just `500Gi`  \r\n\r\nWould be nice to have druid be able to parse input in this format as well.

Description\r\nThis PR updates the `BitmapIndex` interface to add several \"value\" based bitmap retrieval methods, to push the logic of how these are collected into the `BitmapIndex` implementation, instead of leaking details about the underlying dictionaries (such as GenericIndexed.indexOf returning position or -insertion point).\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ImmutableBitmap getBitmapForValue(@Nullable String value);\r\n\r\n  default Iterable<ImmutableBitmap> getBitmapsInRange(\r\n      @Nullable String startValue,\r\n      boolean startStrict,\r\n      @Nullable String endValue,\r\n      boolean endStrict\r\n  )\r\n  {\r\n    return getBitmapsInRange(startValue, startStrict, endValue, endStrict, (index) -> true);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  Iterable<ImmutableBitmap> getBitmapsInRange(\r\n      @Nullable String startValue,\r\n      boolean startStrict,\r\n      @Nullable String endValue,\r\n      boolean endStrict,\r\n      IntPredicate matcher\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  Iterable<ImmutableBitmap> getBitmapsForValues(Set<String> values);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe major changes of adding these methods is that now \"in\", \"bound\", and \"like\" filters push this logic into `BitmapIndex`, so they don't have to know things about the underlying selectors indexes, such as whether or not they are sorted, etc, and now simply call these methods to get a set of `ImmutableBitmap` to do whatever with.\r\n\r\nI consider this the first step of some work I'd like to do on allowing indexes on other types of values, such as numbers and complex types.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes an unrelated bug with `PredicateFilteredDimensionSelector`, where it would return a \"match\" for null rows, even if the predicate didn't match null, meaning sometimes rows which were meant to be filtered out would be considered a match inappropriately.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `BitmapIndex`\r\n * `BitmapIndexSelector`\r\n * `ColumnSelectorBitmapIndexSelector`\r\n *

#12311 \r\n\r\nCurrently, the CNF conversion of a filter is unbounded, which means that it can create as many filters as possible thereby also leading to OOMs in historical heap. We should throw an error or disable CNF conversion if the filter count starts getting out of hand. There are ways to do CNF conversion with linear increase in filters as well but that has been left out of the scope of this change since those algorithms add new variables in the predicate - which can be contentious. Any improved algorithm for conversion can be taken up later upon discussion.  \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIntroduce parallel parsing to the stream ingestion service. This is slightly different as it allows each \"indexing\" task to run parse and transform stages across multiple threads and feed them into a single appenderator.\r\n\r\nThis allows to increase throughput of each task, which has a number of benefits: It allows us to reduce overall task counts for a given number of Kafka partitions, allows for a better response of each task to short periods of peaks and dips in traffic by more effectively sharing resources across partitions.\r\n\r\nThis is *similar, but different*, to https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/7900:\r\n- In 7900, the Indexer creates a number of threads and each threaded task operates as independent within the process rather than a forked process, but operates as it did before in terms of per-task throughput characteristics.\r\n- In this PR, each task can operate parsing across multiple threads so the tasks themselves can handle more messages in a single task.\r\n\r\nConfigurable:\r\n- Introduce a new parameter `parsingThreadCount` which can be set on the kafka tuning config, which configures how many threads will be used to parse and apply transforms to records loaded from streaming datasource.\r\n- If set, the parameter creates a new `parserThreadPool` which will be used for parse & transform operations.\r\n- If no value (`null`), or `1` is used, the existing in-thread behavior occurs (nb: the time of the parse&transform is moved conceptually earlier in the processing).\r\n- If `-1`, or `0` or some other negative value is provided, then automatic selection of number of processors is used based on `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`.\r\n- If a value `1 or more` is used, then that will be the size of the thread pool.\r\n\r\nTo support this:\r\n- Introduce a new `ParseResult` which, combined with `Pair` and `List` can capture the full parse results with any possible errors, including tracking whether the result is thrown away, so that all meters are updated correctly.\r\n- Introduce a `CachingInputRow` that can be used to perform the transformation of the contents of a row on the parallel threads.\r\n- Ensure `TransformSpec::toTransformer` is performed only once and reused (since the input is immutable and a `Transformer` is expensive to create).\r\n- Update `kafka-supervisor-reference.md` with new parameter `parsingThreadCount`\r\n- Extend `KafkaIndexTest` to test with varying combinations of `parsingThreadCount`\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\n- I opted to focus only on the parse & load stage. In order to avoid changing the metric counters etc, during parse stage this collects all possible parse results. Later, immediately prior to append, the metrics will be updated for the row. This ensures all of the existing statistics behavior and error handling is performed exactly as today. It's not clear to me how important the meter data is, and if it is not deemed important we could simplify the result handling and processing. \r\n- In our cluster, the \"serial\" part of work, split between `getRecords` and `Appenderator.add()` takes about 50pc of the task effort, so Amdah's law limits this to a ~1.6x speedup for 4 threads. Since we allocate multiple threads to a task anyway (for GC, queries, etc), being able to use these 4 extra threads provides \"free\" extra throughput. Further work here on the appenderator would allow significant increases in the boost here.\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n\r\n- It would be interesting to combine this with #7900 ; in theory it should be possible to share even the parse thread pool across multiple tasks so that resources are automatically available.\r\n- The appenderator is currently marked as single-caller-only so does not support parallel `add()` calls, this enforces a natural Amdah's Law limit to the scalability. I will have future PRs that should reduce the cost of the appenderator add call. In an ideal world, it would be possible to create a concurrent appenderator which would mean the entire task could parse across many threads.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `extensions-core/kafka-indexing-service/*` to handle the new tuning parameter\r\n * `extensions-core/kinesis-indexing-service/*` to handle the new tuning parameter\r\n * `core/../CachingInputRow` introduced to allow complete pre-instantiation of a row\r\n * `StreamChunkParser` returns a `ParseResult` which embeds the parsing output as well as the status (such as thrown_away)\r\n * `SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner` (and related) to accept the new parameter, and a new function `mapRowBlocks` that performs the logic of transforming input record blocks to a parsed block of records ready for appending.\r\n * `TransformSpec` is modified to allow it to instantiate a `Transformer` only once.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nUse a smaller default buffer in the TextReader during parsing. By default, the [LineIterator creates a BufferedReader if one is not provided](https://github.com/apache/commons-io/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/io/LineIterator.java#L84-L88); the default [BufferedReader creates an 8KB buffer](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u/blob/9a751dc19fae78ce58fb0eb176522070c992fb6f/jdk/src/share/classes/java/io/BufferedReader.java#L88). This is unnecessary for most parsing.\r\n\r\nImprove this by creating our own BufferedReader with a custom line length.\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n- Should this be configurable?\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x]

#10364\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe method getPMF in DoublesSketch performs a sort operation when the number of split points is greater than 50. It looks like the sort is for performance reasons and if it changes the memory, will generate this error in a query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Unknown exception\r\n\r\nMemoryImpl is read-only.\r\n\r\norg.apache.datasketches.memory.ReadOnlyException\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the `deserialize` methods currently wrap with read-only memory.\r\n\r\nModified the method to use `WritableMemory.writableWrap` when deserializing from byte array.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new scripts that can be used as git hooks. To do this, this PR changes the directory structure in https://github.com/apache/druid/tree/master/hooks by adding 2 new directories, `pre-commits` and `pre-pushes`. It also adds 2 new scripts, `pre-commit` and `pre-push`, each of which runs all scripts in `pre-commits` and `pre-pushes` directories, respectively, unless the script name starts with `_`. I didn't add other git hook scripts than pre-commit and pre-push, but they can be added later if necessary.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `pre-commits`\r\n *

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nAdd config for eager / lazy connection initialization in ResourcePool\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nCurrently, when multiple tasks are launched, each of them eagerly initializes a full pool's worth of connections to the coordinator.\r\n\r\nWhile this is acceptable when the parameter for number of eagerConnections (== maxSize) is small, this can be problematic in environments where it's a large value (say 1000) and multiple tasks are launched simultaneously, which can cause a large number of connections to be created to the coordinator, thereby overwhelming it.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n### Patch\r\n\r\nNodes like the broker may require eager initialization of resources and do not create connections with the Coordinator.\r\nIt is unnecessary to do this with other types of nodes.\r\n\r\nA config parameter `eagerInitialization` is added, which when set to true, initializes the max permissible connections when ResourcePool is initialized. \r\n\r\nIf set to false, lazy initialization of connection resources takes place.\r\n\r\n`NOTE`: All nodes except the broker have this new parameter set to false in the quickstart as part of this PR\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n### Algorithm\r\n\r\nThe current implementation relies on the creation of `maxSize` resources eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation's behaviour is as follows:\r\n1) If a resource has been previously created and is available, lend it.\r\n2) Else if the number of created resources is less than the allowed parameter, create and lend it.\r\n3) Else, wait for one of the lent resources to be returned.\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ResourcePool`\r\n * `ResourceHolderPerKey`\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

address.\r\nAlso, we faced a problem in which we saw only the last metrics.\r\nApparently, each metric was sent separately and deleted the previous message.\r\nThe solution was to group all metrics and push them together.\r\n\r\n### Related Issue - #12199 \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Prometheus Emitter`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\nOn very large historical servers with a lot of processors, queries using lookups can find a decent amount of time being wasted on lock contention, when the majority of these lookups are populated offline and then swapped to the new version, making this synchronization unnecessary, at least when using 'on heap' lookups.\r\n\r\nI've re-arranged some code in `lookups-cached-global` to allow the \"versioned\" family of lookups to now \"allocate\" a cache and then later \"attach\" it after it is fully populated, which for on-heap lookups means that a non-concurrent map will be used, and wrapped in a `Collections.unmodifiableMap` when \"attaching\" it to the lookups cache. Since all consumers after initial population are read only, and version updates populate a completely new cache prior to attaching, this should be safe as far as I can tell. Off heap lookups have not been changed and will continue to use the concurrent map implementation at this time.\r\n\r\nKafka extraction lookups still use the old \"createCache\" method, since they do in fact incrementally update lookups as the consumer finds new values, so they should be unchanged by this patch.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR switches `StringTopNColumnAggregatesProcessor`, the string processor used for heap based topN, to use `scanAndAggregateWithCardinalityKnown` for the case where a column is dictionary encoded, but not uniquely, so avoid duplicate decoding of `utf8` bytes from the segment or recomputing expression virtual columns that occur on lookupName in some types of expression selectors. This is potentially worse for things like `IndexedTable`, where dictionaryId might be the row number, so will still have to access the `aggregatesStore` map for every row, but better for things like extractions and expressions on top of \"normal\" dictionary encoded columns.\r\n\r\nThe existing topn tests should provide adequate coverage for this change, but will confirm this with the coverage bot once it runs in travis.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-01T02:31:41Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T07:33:13Z","closed_at":"2022-03-08T22:32:40Z","merged_at":"2022-03-08T22:32:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"dae53ae36a357919698cb8bb3e90934ee64b9fcf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

update maven-surefire-plugin to 3.0.0-M4 for improved compatibility with Java >= 11\r\n   Due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-1815 we need to stay on surefire 3.0.0-M4\r\n   until we can upgrade to 3.0.0-M6, since this is causing issues in RetryUtilsTest.\r\n* upgrade equalsverifier to fix warnings\r\n* modify EnvironmentVariableDynamicConfigProvider test to not use reflection,\r\n   since those classes are no longer accessible in Java 17\r\n* add necessary `--add-opens` flags to pass tests when datasketches-memory is involved\r\n* fix use of deprecated initMocks method\r\n* fix mocks not getting closed\r\n* switch some build steps from Java 15 to Java 17\r\n\r\nNote: This doesn't mean we can run with Java 17 yet.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nAs part of #11791 , the `DockerFIle` for hadoop 3 was referring to paths which are outside its build context. The fix here is to duplicate the template files across both hadoop/hadoop3 folders.\r\nI am open to suggestion if there are other workarounds available. \r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Terminology\r\n\r\n- Column: a logical column that can be stored across multiple segments.\r\n- Null column: a column that has only nulls in it. Druid is aware of this column.\r\n- Unknown column: a column that Druid is not aware of. In other words, it is a column that Druid is not tracking at all via segment metadata or any other methods.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nToday, null columns are not stored at ingestion time and thus they become unknown columns once the ingestion job is done. The druid native query engine uses segment-level schema and treats unknown columns as if they were null columns; reading unknown columns returns only nulls.\r\n\r\nDruid SQL is different. Druid is using Calcite SQL planner which requires valid column information at planning time. The column information is retrieved from datasource-level schema which is dynamically discovered by merging segment schemas. As a result, users cannot query unknown columns using SQL. This is causing a couple of issues. One of the main issues is the SQL queries failing against stream ingestion from time to time. While it creates segments, the realtime task announces a realtime segment that has all columns in the ingestion spec. This realtime task thus reports the broker even null columns for the realtime segment which can be used by the Druid SQL planner. Once the segment is handed off to a historical, it announces a historical segment that does not store any null columns in it. As a result, the same SQL query will no longer work after the segment is handed off.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nTo make the SQL planner be aware of null columns, Druid needs to track of them. This PR proposes to store those null columns in the segment just like normal columns.\r\n\r\n#### Feature flag\r\n\r\n`druid.indexer.task.storeEmptyColumns` is added. This is on by default. A new task context, `storeEmptyColumns`, is added which can override the system property.\r\n\r\n#### Ingestion tasks\r\n\r\nWhen `storeEmptyColumns` is set, the task stores every column specified in `DimensionsSpec` in the segments that it creates. This applies to all kinds of ingestion except for Hadoop ingestion and Tranquility.\r\n\r\n#### Segment writes/reads\r\n\r\nFor null columns, Druid stores a column name, column type, number of rows, and bitmapSerdeFactory. The first two are stored in `ColumnDescriptor` and the last two are stored in `NullColumnPartSerde`. `NullColumnPartSerde` has a no-op serializer and a deserializer that can dynamically create a bitmap index and a dictionary. Finally, the null column names are stored at the end of `index.drd` separately from normal columns. This is for the compatibility for older historicals. When they read a segment that has null column stored, they won't be aware of those columns but will just ignore them without exploding. \r\n\r\n#### Test plan\r\n\r\n- Unit tests are added in this PR to verify the compatibility for older historicals.\r\n- Unit tests are added in this PR to verify that null columns are stored in segments.\r\n- Integration tests will be added in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12268.\r\n\r\n#### Future work\r\n\r\n- Currently, null numeric dimensions are always being stored even without this change. I would call this a bug as 1) its behavior doesn't match with string dimensions and 2) it currently stores all nulls in the segment file along with the null bitmap index, and reads them for query processing which is unnecessary and inefficient.\r\n- Hadoop ingestion may be supported later.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `NullColumnPartSerde`\r\n * `IndexIO`\r\n * `IndexMergerV9`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#3922\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR adds a new way of storing `STRING` typed columns, using an incremental encoding strategy called 'front coding'. Essentially, sorted values are split into buckets; the first value in the bucket is written completely and the remaining values in the bucket are stored as a pair, composed of the length of the first string which overlaps this value (the prefix length), and the remaining fragment of the value that remains after the prefix. Using the quickstart wikipedia example, this results in nicely reduced segment sizes, with relatively little performance penalty in most typical Druid queries.\r\n\r\n#### Segment Size and Performance\r\nWikipedia \"quickstart\" segments:\r\n<img width=\"968\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-02-23 at 3 19 33 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/155309650-ba583aed-417d-4a8c-bcda-0b00aa08b076.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n`GenericIndexed<ByteBuffer>` \"singleThreaded\" vs `FrontCodedIndexed` with bucket size 4 and size 16:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                            (indexType)  (numElements)  (numOperations)  (width)  Mode  Cnt        Score    Error  Units\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get                           generic          10000            10000       16  avgt    5       12.842 ±  0.309  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get                           generic         100000            10000       16  avgt    5       14.173 ±  0.259  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get                     front-coded-4          10000            10000       16  avgt    5       39.418 ±  0.989  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get                     front-coded-4         100000            10000       16  avgt    5       43.614 ±  1.081  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get                    front-coded-16          10000            10000       16  avgt    5       68.667 ±  0.674  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get                    front-coded-16         100000            10000       16  avgt    5       72.695 ±  0.170  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.indexOf                       generic          10000            10000       16  avgt    5      161.167 ±  1.945  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.indexOf                       generic         100000            10000       16  avgt    5      229.376 ±  4.963  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.indexOf                 front-coded-4          10000            10000       16  avgt    5      243.259 ±  0.290  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.indexOf                 front-coded-4         100000            10000       16  avgt    5      377.807 ±  5.362  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.indexOf                front-coded-16          10000            10000       16  avgt    5      252.050 ±  0.786  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.indexOf                front-coded-16         100000            10000       16  avgt    5      381.047 ±  4.761  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.iterator                      generic          10000            10000       16  avgt    5       39.341 ±  0.623  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.iterator                      generic         100000            10000       16  avgt    5      384.242 ±  0.899  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.iterator                front-coded-4          10000            10000       16  avgt    5       95.082 ± 18.971  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.iterator                front-coded-4         100000            10000       16  avgt    5      690.636 ± 27.592  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.iterator               front-coded-16          10000            10000       16  avgt    5       77.685 ± 29.205  ns/op\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.iterator               front-coded-16         100000            10000       16  avgt    5      606.071 ± 25.713  ns/op\r\n\r\n\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get:encoded size              generic          10000            10000       16  avgt    5   240010.000           bytes\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get:encoded size              generic         100000            10000       16  avgt    5  2400010.000           bytes\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get:encoded size        front-coded-4          10000            10000       16  avgt    5   169992.000           bytes\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get:encoded size        front-coded-4         100000            10000       16  avgt    5  1636900.000           bytes\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get:encoded size       front-coded-16          10000            10000       16  avgt    5   164187.000           bytes\r\nFrontCodedIndexedBenchmark.get:encoded size       front-coded-16         100000            10000       16  avgt    5  1564828.000           bytes\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow this translates into queries has so far been measured with `SqlBenchmark`, though it's generated data-set does pretty poorly with this encoding due to being composed of numbers which have been translated directly into strings, leaving few prefixes to take advantage of (383MB with generic indexed compared to 381MB with front-coded indexed). This means that any size advantage is not present here and so this is likely near worst case for this encoding strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT SUM(sumLongSequential), SUM(sumFloatNormal) FROM foo

scale testing on actual clusters with real workloads, but the benchmark results look very promising at this point and show very little overhead at query time, with a decent chance the reduced segment sizes will more than make up for it.\r\n\r\n#### Design\r\nThe encoding itself is done within a new `Indexed` implementation, `FrontCodedIndexed`, which contains all of the methods for reading and writing the buckets of values. I adapted 'variable byte' encoding for integer values from [JavaFastPFOR](https://github.com/lemire/JavaFastPFOR/blob/master/src/main/java/me/lemire/integercompression/VariableByte.java) to write both string value lengths as well as prefix lengths. \r\n\r\nstring layout:\r\n| length | value |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| vbyte int | byte[] |\r\n\r\nbucket layout:\r\n| first string | prefix length | string fragment | ... | prefix length | string fragment |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| byte[] | vbyte int | byte[] | ... | vbyte int | byte[] |\r\n\r\nfront coded indexed layout:\r\n| version | bucket size | has null? | number of values | size of \"offsets\" + \"buckets\" | \"offsets\" | \"buckets\" |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \r\n| byte | byte | byte | vbyte int | vbyte int | int[] | bucket[] |\r\n\r\nNote that the \"offsets\" store the starting location of all buckets beyond the first bucket (whose offset is known to be the end of the \"offsets\" position). The \"offsets\" are stored as plain integer values instead of vbyte encoded to allow for fast access of the bucket positions, but are probably a good candidate for delta encoded byte packing to further decrease their size.\r\n\r\n#### Using it\r\nThis functionality can be utilized by a new property to `IndexSpec`, `stringDictionaryEncoding`, which can be set to `{\"type\":\"frontCoded\", \"bucketSize\": 4}` or `{\"type\":\"frontCoded\", \"bucketSize\": 16}`  or something similar, to instruct indexing tasks to write segments with the compressed dictionaries with bucket size 4 or 16 respectively. (`{\"type\":\"utf8\"}` is the default).\r\n\r\nThis mode is not set it as the default yet because any segments written like this will be unreadable by older versions of Druid, so care must be taken before migrating to this encoding. Additionally, this needs a lot more testing and measurement to ensure that it is genuinely better in most cases before making it the default, but it looks pretty promising.\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\nBesides the direct tests on `FrontCodedIndexed` and `VByte`, I also wired a front-coded segment into both `BaseFilterTest` and `QueryTestHelper`, which provides a rather wide set of test coverage for a variety of scenarios. This process found a number of bugs in my initial commits, so I feel reasonably confident that things are correct at this point.\r\n\r\n#### Future work\r\n\r\nBefore I started coding on this, in addition to the paper linked in #3922, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.5506.pdf, I also read through https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08372.pdf which was a newer paper by one of the authors on the first link, and also stumbled upon https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00778-020-00620-x.pdf, all of which detail additional (much fancier) improvements which can be made to this strategy by further coding the string values (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-Pair seems the primary focus in these papers). It would probably be worth investigating to determine at what cost additional size improvements can be gained.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it seems to be ideal to be able to vary which encoding is used per column instead of setting it at the segment level (this seems true of other types of compression as well...). This could allow collection of statistic at indexing time to determine how likely this encoding is to be useful, such as minimum value cardinality thresholds or similar (akin to the 'auto' encoding available for long columns).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `VByte`\r\n * `FrontCodedIndexed`\r\n * `FrontCodedIndexedWriter`\r\n * `StringDimensionMergerV9`\r\n * `DictionaryEncodedColumnPartSerde`\r\n * `DictionaryEncodedStringColumnIndexSupplier` (internal classes split out into several new files)\r\n * `StringFrontCodedDictionaryEncodedColumn`\r\n * `StringFrontCodedDictionaryEncodedColumnSupplier`\r\n * `StringFrontCodedColumnIndexSupplier`\r\n * `NestedDataColumnMerger`\r\n * `NestedDataColumnSupplier`\r\n * `CompressedNestedDataComplexColumn`\r\n * `NestedFieldLiteralColumnIndexSupplier`\r\n * `NestedFieldLiteralDictionaryEncodedColumn`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nToday, `dimensionsSpec` has two modes with `flattenSpec` as below.\r\n\r\n1) If `dimensions` is set in `dimensionsSpec`, only those explicit dimensions are ingested.\r\n2) If `dimensions is not set, all dimensions that `flattenSpec` provides are ingested.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a missing use case that I want to ingest both the dimensions in `dimensionsSpec` and other dimensions discovered using `flattenSpec` during ingestion. To address this, this PR adds a new flag, `includeAllDimensions` in `dimensionsSpec`. `MapInputRowParser` will put all explicit dimensions first in `InputRow` and then any other dimensions found in input data.\r\n\r\nTo reviewers, my apologies for an invasive PR. The number of files is huge, but they are mostly unit tests as tons of them are creating `dimensionsSpec`. To avoid such an invasive change in the future, I added a builder for `dimensionsSpec` and fixed unit tests to use the builder instead.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DimensionsSpec`\r\n * `MapInputRowParser`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

`InputFormat` instead of `ParseSpec` can be very slow if complex flattening scheme is used. This is because with InputFormat, we create an `InputEntityReader` for every stream chunk. It was assumed that creating the reader is a cheap operation but it is not in some cases. \r\n\r\nHere are two flame graphs to illustrate the difference\r\nTask runner thread with InputFormat\r\n![Screenshot 2022-02-18 at 1 42 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1477457/154686173-9f8551b0-54b0-4986-b601-ae54ed62684d.png)\r\n\r\nTask runner thread with ParseSpec\r\n![Screenshot 2022-02-18 at 1 41 46 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1477457/154686201-03b5c9eb-efaa-4f16-aefa-74530da6dcf7.png)\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing the JsonParser, I have added a new class called `SettableByteEntity` that allows one to add new binary data without creating a new InputStream. So we can create an InputEntityReader just once instead of creating it for every stream chunk. Readers for different formats consume one chunk at a time from input stream while the StreamChunkParser sets the new chunk on the input stream. This all happens in a single thread. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Looks like proto readers will never have null `flattenSpec` outside unit test cases as in \r\n\r\n```java\r\n protected NestedInputFormat(@Nullable JSONPathSpec flattenSpec)\r\n  {\r\n    this.flattenSpec = flattenSpec == null ? JSONPathSpec.DEFAULT : flattenSpec;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nif the `flattenSpec` is null, its replaced with `JSONPathSpec.DEFAULT`  and that is passed to the `parseInputRows` .\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso in `ProtobufReader` we were creating the `objectMapper` per invocation of `parseInputRows`. Changed the `objecMapper`  to a  class level static member as `objectMapper` is threadsafe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning `ProtobufParserBenchmark` benchmark pre change \r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                  (rowsPerSegment)  Mode  Cnt       Score       Error  Units\r\nProtobufParserBenchmark.consumeFlatData               75000  avgt   10  237032.878 ± 10393.225  us/op\r\nProtobufParserBenchmark.consumeNestedData             75000  avgt   10  904688.838 ± 68144.032  us/op\r\n\r\n```\r\nand post the changes\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                  (rowsPerSegment)  Mode  Cnt       Score       Error  Units\r\nProtobufParserBenchmark.consumeFlatData               75000  avgt   10  232640.798 ± 12513.626  us/op\r\nProtobufParserBenchmark.consumeNestedData             75000  avgt   10  941895.245 ± 45837.099  us/op\r\n```\r\nwe see an 4.5 % improvement\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

One of them is [Shared access resource\r\n](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string#create-a-connection-string-using-a-shared-access-signature) .

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nAdded a new config ``sharedAccessStorageToken`` which can be passed as part of azure properties to enable this behavior.

coordinator run auto compaction duty period to be configured separately from other indexing duties\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUser may want to run auto compaction duty more frequently. Auto compaction does already have task slot limits (max slot and ratio) to prevent auto compaction from starving other ingestion tasks. Hence, it is safe to run auto compaction more frequently so that we can consistently utilized all the task slots available to auto compaction. However, before this change auto compaction duty is tied to other indexing duties and changing the period for auto compaction will also impact the other duties. This PR uses https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11601 functionality that allows coordinator to be dynamically enabled via the configs. With this PR change, user can run auto compaction duty in it's own coordinator group using the following config:\r\n```\r\ndruid.coordinator.dutyGroups=[\"compaction\"]\r\ndruid.coordinator.compaction.duties=[\"compactSegments\"]\r\ndruid.coordinator.compaction.period=PT60S\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make the `ParseExceptions` in Druid more informative, by adding additional information (metadata) to the ParseException, which can contain additional information about the exception. For example - the path of the file generating the issue, the line number (where it can be easily fetched - like CsvReader)\r\n\r\nFollowing changes are addressed in this PR:\r\n1. A new class `CloseableIteratorWithMetadata` has been created which is like `CloseableIterator` but also has a metadata method that returns a context Map<String, Object> about the current element returned by `next()`.\r\n2. `IntermediateRowParsingReader#read()` now attaches the `InputEntity` and the \"record number\" which created the exception (while parsing them), and `IntermediateRowParsingReader#sample` attaches the `InputEntity` (but not the \"record number\").\r\n3. `TextReader` (and its subclasses), which is a specific implementation of the `IntermediateRowParsingReader` also include the line number which caused the generation of the error.\r\n\r\nThis will also help in triaging the issues when `InputSourceReader` generates `ParseException` because it can point to the specific `InputEntity` which caused the exception (while trying to read it). \r\n\r\n### Change in the output\r\n###### Old\r\n```\"Timestamp[99999999999-01-01T00:00:10Z] is unparseable!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n## Combination of cachingCost balancer + all segmentGranularity + no interval not loading segments after ingestion\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

Description\r\n\r\nThis fixes intermittent, spurious failures that we've observed in the Kinesis sharding integration tests due to Kinesis taking longer than the code expected to start a sharding operation. The method that's changed is part of the integration test suite and only used by the test cases that we've seen are flaky.\r\n\r\n#### Increase retries\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, the tests expected a sharding operation to start in 9 seconds (30 retries * 300ms delay/retry). This change bumps the number of retries to 100, giving Kinesis 30 seconds to start the sharding.\r\n\r\nWe chose this value to ensure the existing tests always pass for us while still allowing them to fail reasonably fast if there's some integration logic error. This Amazon doesn't provide guidance on when an operation might start but does document that a [\"scaling action could take a few minutes to complete\".](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateShardCount.html)\r\n\r\n#### Clarify the condition\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes a small, clarifying change to the condition used to determine if sharding has started. Instead of checking if the number of shards has increased (which was technically correct even if the test is reducing the number of shards due to a Kinesis implementation detail), we now just check if the shard count has changed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n* `org.apache.druid.testing.utils.KinesisAdminClient`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x]

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `GroupByQueryConfig`\r\n * `GroupByQueryEngineV2`\r\n * `GroupByQueryEngine`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nFollow-up to #12241, this PR updates the \"simple\" SQL aggregators, such as `SUM`, `MIN`, and `MAX` to use `VirtualColumn` instead of the inline `expression` to maximize expression re-use for anything more complicated than a literal value.\r\n\r\n`CalciteQueryTest.testExpressionAggregations` has been update to have aggregators which share a common expression, which will now be shared between these two aggregators instead of each specifying it inline. Additionally, this allows these aggregators to participate in the 'specialization' added in #12241.\r\n\r\nFinally, did some follow-up javadoc and naming adjustments per comments in the previous PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SimpleSqlAggregator`\r\n * `DruidExpression`\r\n * `VirtualColumnRegistry`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid
