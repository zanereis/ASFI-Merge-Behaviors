We can include this in something like 2.0.1 or 2.1.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIf there is any `None` value in the data, it is rendered as string `\"None\"` in the YAML/JSON format. This is incorrect, because `None` value is represented as `null` in both YAML and JSON, and only when it's `null` it will be recognized as \"missing\" value. `\"None\"` in YAML or JSON will be considered as a normal string.\r\n\r\nWith this issue, people may get unexpected behaviour when they try to parse the YAML/JSON results.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nDon't explicitly convert `None` to string.\r\n\r\n### Sample Code to Reproduce The Issue\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import yaml\r\n>>> yaml.safe_load(\"- name: None\")\r\n[{'name': 'None'}]\r\n>>> yaml.safe_load(\"- name: null\")\r\n[{'name': None}]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### CLI Output BEFORE This Fix (command `airflow connections list -o [json|yaml]`)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"393\" alt=\"Default__-zsh_\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/101954100-d3bad900-3bfb-11eb-9548-a38047b7a2d9.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1293\" alt=\"Default__-zsh__and_airflow_–_simple_table_py\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/101954105-d6b5c980-3bfb-11eb-82c2-86df3f244466.png\">\r\n\r\n### CLI Output AFTER This Fix (command `airflow connections list -o [json|yaml]`)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"344\" alt=\"Default__-zsh_-2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/101954146-e46b4f00-3bfb-11eb-9fac-1cc265b284d2.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1319\" alt=\"Default__-zsh__and_airflow_simple_table_py_at_master_·_apache_airflow\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/101954157-e6351280-3bfb-11eb-9d56-9b6c4d1fb4fc.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

everyone is aware that we have divided the documentation and now it is possible to build documentation for only one package, which is much faster. I am adding messages encouraging them to take advantage of these options to let more people know about it.\r\n\r\nI also hope to reduce the number of failed builds on CI if users can quickly test their changes locally. Previously, building documentation took too long for anyone to want to do it locally.\r\n\r\nSample message from a user who was unaware of this flag.\r\n\r\n> I gave up on building the doc locally as it seems to take a really long, so I create the PR first to see if it can go through the CI. I will build it locally again if it's necessary. Do you have any tips on speeding up the building process?

we released all teh provider packages to PyPI now in\r\nRC version, we can now change the mechanism to prepare the\r\nproduction to use released packages in case of tagged builds.\r\n\r\nThe \"branch\" production images are still prepared using the\r\nCI images and .whl packages built from sources, but the\r\nrelease packages are built from officially released PyPI\r\npackages.\r\n\r\nAlso some corrections and updates were made to the release process:\r\n\r\n* the constraint tags when RC candidate is sent should contain\r\n  rcn suffix.\r\n\r\n* there was missing step about pushing the release tag once the\r\n  release is out\r\n\r\n* pushing tag to GitHub should be done after the PyPI packages\r\n  are uploaded, so that automated image building in DockerHub\r\n  can use those packages.\r\n\r\n* added a note that in case we will release some provider\r\n  packages that depend on the just released airflow version\r\n  they shoudl be released after airflow is in PyPI but before\r\n  the tag is pushed to GitHub (also to allow the image to be\r\n  build automatically from the released packages)\r\n\r\nFixes: #12970\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you

checker\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nCheck that the latest version of apache-airflow-upgrade-check is installed, and\r\nthat you are on the latest 1.10.x release of apache-airflow.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n\r\n  1.  There is a more recent version of apache-airflow-upgrade-check. Please upgrade to 1.0.0 and re-run this script\r\n\r\nUnify hostname_callable option in core section\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n\r\n  1.  Error: hostname_callable `socket:getfqdn` contains a colon instead of a dot. please change to `socket.getfqdn`\r\n\r\nChanges in import paths of hooks, operators, sensors and others\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMany hooks, operators and other classes has been renamed and moved. Those changes were part of unifying names and imports paths as described in AIP-21.\r\nThe `contrib` folder has been replaced by `providers` directory and packages:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow#backport-packages\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n\r\n  1.  Using `airflow.operators.bash_operator.BashOperator` will be replaced by `airflow.operators.bash.BashOperator`. Affected file: /files/dags/blogpost.py\r\n  2.  Using `airflow.operators.python_operator.PythonOperator` will be replaced by `airflow.operators.python.PythonOperator`. Affected file: /files/dags/blogpost.py\r\n  3.  Using `airflow.operators.bash_operator.BashOperator` will be replaced by `airflow.operators.bash.BashOperator`. Affected file: /files/dags/none-from-time-to-time.py\r\n  4.  Using `airflow.operators.bash_operator.BashOperator` will be replaced by `airflow.operators.bash.BashOperator`. Affected file: /files/dags/td_test.py\r\n  5.  Using `airflow.operators.python_operator.PythonOperator` will be replaced by `airflow.operators.python.PythonOperator`. Affected file: /files/dags/td_test.py\r\n\r\nUsers must set a kubernetes.pod_template_file value\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nSkipped because this rule applies only to environment using KubernetesExecutor.\r\n```\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

is a change discussed long time back in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3889#issuecomment-507635839\r\n\r\nCurrently, ONLY Admin role is allowed to view \"Profile\" page, and edit profile info or reset password there. All other roles will get \"Access Denied\" if they click this `Your Profile` button.\r\n\r\n![Airflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/101684427-ac7ed300-3a66-11eb-86d3-11a08caa357c.png)\r\n![Airflow-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/101684434-b0aaf080-3a66-11eb-8207-02b2e2155780.png)\r\n\r\nThe ideal situation should be:\r\n- all (default) roles should be able to view their profile page.\r\n- all (default) roles should be able to edit their profile (change first/last names), only if the webserver is DB-based.\r\n- all (default) roles should be able to reset their password, only if the webserver is DB-based.\r\n(For example, if the webserver is using LDAP or OAuth, users should NOT be allowed to edit their profile or reset password.)\r\n\r\nEssentially, the 7 permission-resource pairs are added for all default roles:\r\n- `can_this_form_post` on `UserInfoEditView`\r\n- `can_this_form_get` on `UserInfoEditView`\r\n- `can_userinfo` on `UserDBModelView`\r\n- `userinfoedit` on `UserDBModelView`\r\n- `can_this_form_post` on `ResetMyPasswordView`\r\n- `can_this_form_get` on `ResetMyPasswordView`\r\n- `resetmypassword` on `UserDBModelView`\r\n\r\nIn addition, `can_userinfo` are added for all other possible User ModelViews (`UserOIDModelView`, `UserLDAPModelView`, `UserOAuthModelView`, and `UserRemoteUserModelView`.

AWS docs for starting a new ECS task via the `RunTask` API mention that If a `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified, the `launchType` parameter must be omitted. If no `capacityProviderStrategy` or` launchType` is specified, the `defaultCapacityProviderStrategy` for the cluster is used. More details [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html#API_RunTask_RequestSyntax). So, logic takes care of this by omitting/ignoring the `launchType` if `capacityProviderStrategy` is specified.\r\n\r\ncloses: #8381 \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like to know if manual testing by creating an ECS task on AWS cloud is required for this feqture?\r\n\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

have talked about switching from unittest-style assertions (like `self.assertEqual(foo, bar)`) to plain pytest-style assertions (like `assert foo == bar`) on slack and the mailing list, but it doesn't seem like we've decided so far. I wanted to send a sample PR to show how this might work. I generated these changes with a one-line command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nunittest2pytest -f self_assert tests/core -w\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we try to refactor many tests at once, we'll likely run into conflicts, but because we can auto-refactor the code easily, fixing conflicts should be straightforward too.\r\n\r\nNote that I didn't use the `remove_class` fixer or move test setup into fixtures--this just concerns assertion style.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem like an improvement? If so, we can refactor tests module by module, or run `unittest2pytest` on all the tests at once.\r\n\r\ncc @ashb @potiuk

if a user doesn't have edit access for a DAG, the Pause/Unpause switch can still be switched in the UI (not in the backend). This PR disables the switch for DAGs the user doesn't have access to edit. This is on the DAG list page as well as individual detail pages.\r\n\r\nActivating/deactivating the switch is handled on a per-DAG basis. To prevent slow load time for users with a large number of DAGs, the \"algorithm\" used to identify whether a list of DAGs is editable has `Time complexity  = O(#DAGs on page * nLog(n) of the # of individual permissions a user has)`. So the lookup time is dependent on the number of permissions a user has, and is independent of the total number of DAGs.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4926004/101458307-91d41f00-38eb-11eb-8a47-06e219c61db8.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4926004/101458551-df508c00-38eb-11eb-964b-d1c348b36754.png)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T08:25:54Z","updated_at":"2020-12-08T21:26:28Z","closed_at":"2020-12-08T21:26:25Z","merged_at":"2020-12-08T21:26:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"73843d05f753b9fb8d6d3928e5c5695ad955e15a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.
