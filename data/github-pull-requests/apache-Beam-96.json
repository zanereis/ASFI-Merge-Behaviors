these.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, we don't have a well defined automated system for staying on top of pull request reviews - we rely on contributors being able to find the correct OWNERS file and committers manually triaging/calling attention to old pull requests. This is the continuation of an effort to improve our automation around this. [Design doc for the full effort here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FhRPRD6VXkYlLAPhNfZB7y2Yese2FCWBzjx67d3TjBo/edit#).\r\n\r\nThis specific change adds automation to flag prs that should be receiving attention but aren't. There are basically 3 parts:\r\n\r\n1) Find prs that are assigned to a reviewer and haven't had action in 7 days - tag the reviewers and add a slow-review label.\r\n2) Find prs with the slow-review label that haven't had action in 2 additional business days - assign a new set of **committers**\r\n3) Remove the slow-review label any time a reviewer performs a review or comments on the pr.\r\n\r\nThis was tested in my test repo here - https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo. I lowered the time thresholds so I didn't have to wait for a PR to sit for days to test it. The only eligible PR for the automation was initially https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo/pull/4, so that's where most of the testing happened. There's a lot of junk in between the start and finish as I was getting things working, but the last couple comments show it working. The other prs show that they get excluded correctly (either because they've had notifications silenced or they have not had reviewers assigned by the bot for other reasons.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution! Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual

were a couple unexpected consequences of turning this on for a new repo that I hadn't run into in testing because I'd always been working on an existing repo without pr history:\r\n\r\n1) The pull of our dedicated state branch fails the first time because the branch isn't guaranteed to exist yet. This should have been best effort.\r\n2) Existing in progress PRs are viewed as new and treated as such because the PR bot doesn't know about their state.\r\n\r\nThis fixes both issues. It also stops us from commenting about failing checks when a PR just has non-completed checks.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, we don't have a well defined automated system for staying on top of pull request reviews - we rely on contributors being able to find the correct OWNERS file and committers manually triaging/calling attention to old pull requests. This is the continuation of an effort to improve our automation around this. [Design doc for the full effort here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FhRPRD6VXkYlLAPhNfZB7y2Yese2FCWBzjx67d3TjBo/edit#).\r\n\r\nThis specific change is mostly independent of the rest - it gets metrics about how well we are handling prs and outputs them into a CSV. The generated output columns are: \r\n\r\n- Bucket start (bucketed by merge time)\r\n- Prs Completed\r\n- Prs completed by first time contributors\r\n- Average time in minutes to first review\r\n- Average time in minutes to first review for new contributors\r\n- Average time in minutes from pr creation to completion\r\n- Total number of reviewers\r\n- Total number of committers performing reviews\r\n- Total number of non-committers performing reviews\r\n- Gini index (fairness) of committers performing reviews\r\n- Average time in minutes from committer assignment to pr merge\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, we don't have a well defined automated system for staying on top of pull request reviews - we rely on contributors being able to find the correct OWNERS file and committers manually triaging/calling attention to old pull requests. This is the continuation of an effort to improve our automation around this. [Design doc for the full effort here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FhRPRD6VXkYlLAPhNfZB7y2Yese2FCWBzjx67d3TjBo/edit#).\r\n\r\nThis specific change turns on the bot for changes to the Go Sdk - it shouldn't have any impact on other sdks. It builds off of the most recent set of changes in #16898. This code is mirrored here - https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo - you can see see the completed portions of the bot in action in [the prs in that repo](https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo/pulls) (they show different use cases and exercise almost all of the behavior of the bot).\r\n\r\n**Next Steps**\r\n\r\nInitially, I am filtering all bot activity prs with the Go label. This is to minimize the blast radius of the automation in case it doesn't work perfectly out the gate or we find it unhelpful. Eventually, I plan on expanding to the rest of the repo.\r\n\r\nI also plan on adding some more p2 functionality. This includes:\r\n\r\n- A script to gather metrics to measure the bots effectiveness (comparing it to historical data)\r\n- Flagging/updating reviewers for stale review requests\r\n- Automatically updating our reviewer config to incorporate new reviewers\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution! Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nSee the [Contributor Guide](https://beam.apache.org/contribute) for more tips on [how to make review process

is part 1 of 2 to add bundle finalization support to the Go Sdk.\r\n\r\n**Summary of Overall Changes**\r\n\r\nBundle finalization enables a DoFn to perform side effects after a runner has acknowledged that it has durably persisted the output. Right now, Java and Python support bundle finalization by allowing a user to register a callback function which is invoked when the runner acknowledges that it has persisted all output, but Go does not have any such support. This is part of a larger change to add support to the Go Sdk as outlined in this [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dLylt36oFhsWfyBaqPayYXqYHCICNrSZ6jmr51eqZ4k/edit#).\r\n\r\nI've completed all the changes (sans some better testing on the parts not in this PR), you can see the remaining files in the diff here - https://github.com/apache/beam/compare/master...damccorm:users/damccorm/bundle-finalization?expand=1\r\n\r\n**Summary of Changes in this PR**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds most of the non user facing changes needed to enable this change. There are basically 2 major components:\r\n\r\n1. Changes to exec/pardo.go and exec/fn.go to add the bundleFinalizer type and pass it into the user's DoFn when appropriate.\r\n1. Changes to harness.go and plan.go to manage plans that require finalization, respond to the runner sending the bundle finalization message, and to invoke the callbacks.\r\n\r\n**Additional testing done**\r\n\r\nOn top of the units added, using my full implementation (not just this partial one) I also was able to run an E2E example on Dataflow (FWIW, not all runners have finalization support but I found that Dataflow does). In that example, I hijacked the wordcount example and added a bundleFinalizer to write a file to persistent storage for each line that had at least 3 words (chosen pretty randomly to minimize the chances of collisions). I'll omit the whole sample since its long, but it produced a bunch of files like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"259\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42773683/156254068-adab3a92-7978-4284-9963-8b80c8ecbf59.png\">\r\n\r\nThis indeed ran after the other data was persisted\r\n\r\n**Next Steps**\r\n\r\nAfter this, I'll add the user facing functionality in a follow up pr, along with testing for that and 1+ integration test for the whole flow.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The protobuf runtime for Golang maintains a global registry of all protobufs being used by registering the descriptors using the file path to the source proto file. If multiple descriptors with the same source file path are registered to the global registry, then the initialization code will prevent startup by panic-ing and printing a message like this to stdout:\r\n\r\n```\r\npanic: proto: file \"metrics.proto\" is already registered\r\n\tpreviously from: \"github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/pkg/beam/model/pipeline_v1\"\r\n\tcurrently from:  \"...\"\r\nSee https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go/faq#namespace-conflict\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior in the Go Protocol Buffer SDK is unlikely to [go away](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/protobuf/+/322729/):\r\n\r\n> reflect/protoregistry: restore conflicting file names check\r\n>\r\n>There are inconsistencies between implementations on what happens when a single program contains generated code for multiple files with the same source path. At least one canonical implementation (C++) will fail at link time. Others print warnings. Some silently resolve the registry conflict in favor of one file or the other. The protobuf maintainers agree, however, that the desired behavior is for this condition to be an error.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to bring the protobuf imports in Beam to follow the guidance from a comment in this [issue](https://github.com/golang/protobuf/issues/1122#issuecomment-853158260) filed with the protobuf repo:\r\n\r\n> To avoid conflicts, every source .proto that is part of a program must have a unique name. Practically speaking, this means that any .proto that is part of a public package should be placed in a directory that uniquely identifies the owner of the proto. For example, google/protobuf/descriptor.proto and k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/types both have prefixes which specify the creating organization and a specific package within that organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs such, I've elected to place each protobuf package in a directory `org/apache/beam/model` relative to its respective module root and have updated the build system where necessary.\r\n\r\nP.S. This is still a work in progress, but opened the PR to socialize since this will affect all of Beam.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds tests to the dbio read functionality using an in-memory local DB. There are a couple things to consider here:\r\n\r\n1) This was the best in-memory go db driver I could find, and it works well for the read tests, but I couldn't get it to test the writes because it throws an error at `SELECT ... WHERE 1 = 0` (called [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/ba2aef5972eca7322ae68f81bafd52d894e43edf/sdks/go/pkg/beam/io/databaseio/database.go#L166) to validate the schema) because the package is still building out full syntactical support. That's why I'm only testing reads, and I don't think we have the option to test writes with this package (since I'd rather not change our implementation to support our mock's bugs).\r\n2) This package isn't incredibly widely used, so there's probably some risk in taking a test dependency on it. If we ever need to upgrade and that's an issue we can always just get rid of the test though. [Package repo](https://github.com/proullon/ramsql) here, its got ~500 stars. It has gotten reasonably consistent patches. Are there requirements from Beam for us to include this package as a dependency?\r\n\r\nAll in all, I think the pros of getting a full test of the actual functionality (vs testing small pieces of the code) outweigh the cons here, but I'm open to thoughts from others. There's not a great alternative that I see (mocking is basically impossible here since the db is opened from within the DoFn). Its definitely not a straightforward decision to take this change though. \r\n\r\nIf we don't do this, I'd probably recommend just skipping databaseio tests.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, we don't have a well defined automated system for staying on top of pull request reviews - we rely on contributors being able to find the correct OWNERS file and committers manually triaging/calling attention to old pull requests. This is the continuation of an effort to improve our automation around this. [Design doc for the full effort here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FhRPRD6VXkYlLAPhNfZB7y2Yese2FCWBzjx67d3TjBo/edit#) Part 1 was https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16898\r\n\r\nI have the code to handle new prs and pr updates in a repo here - https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo - this is a subset of the https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo/pull/1 split up to try to keep reviews manageable. This PR introduces the files used to process new prs and pr updates and it builds on the shared files introduced in the last PR. This contains most of the business logic of the tool. It also contains a .gitignore and Commands.md file I missed in the last PR.\r\n\r\nInitially, I am filtering all bot activity prs with the Go label. This is to minimize the blast radius of the automation in case it doesn't work perfectly out the gate or we find it unhelpful. Eventually, I plan on expanding to the rest of the repo.\r\n\r\nYou can see see the completed portions of the bot in action in https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo/pull/3 and https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo/pull/4 (they show different use cases and exercise almost all of the behavior of the bot).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution! Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nSee the [Contributor Guide](https://beam.apache.org/contribute) for more tips on [how to make review process

@aromanenko-dev Not really a PR (yet), I was just looking to understand the usage of schemas vs coders better.\r\nThe (most) interesting part here is probably `SdkPojoSchema` that works for all the generated AWS models in the SDK v2 (though, in some cases recursive types are used which obviously impose a challenge).\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to find a lot of good technical documentation (design decisions) for schemas in Beam, though definitely see the value over low level coders! It seems to make sense to bother users as little as possible with coders and [not expose these on any public API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V2FkGGunVgvLwi1dKHr-7mtDuwYjTuvuESV_oPzVnfQ/edit?resourcekey=0-KvfQq-5iCcMlu3f3MFJ-GQ#heading=h.xl97lw3dyot7) (M11). Currently coders are all over the place for AWS IOs, with this it seems feasible to drop them (or deprecate).\r\n\r\nThough, I was wondering a couple of things:\r\n- Looks like I cannot register a provider for an interface (`SdkPojo`), that means I have to \"announce\" it globally using an auto service.\r\n- Is there a way a Sink/ WriteIO can set the coder for it's input like that can be done for a Source on the output? Looks like it's only possible to register such a coder globally, regardless if that sink is used or not.\r\n- I noticed that a RowCoder cannot be automatically inferred for a row despite every row carrying its schema. That makes sense given runners may use the schema ahead of time for query planning. But it made me wonder if there's any relationship between the schema of the row coder and the runtime schema enforced... \r\n\r\nIf you have any good resources on the topic, I'd be happy to hear ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

technically had a test file, but it was just an example of how to use the class (which I got rid of because it didn't seem very useful and didn't make much sense in a test file IMO).\r\n\r\nMost of this package is wrappers around the gcs client which is not worth testing IMO (the mocking would probably be more complex than the functions being tested). This tests the other functions (mostly to do with url pathing)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fix: removing the 'No cluster_manager is associated with the provided pipeline!' logger error message when a pipeline is present, but has no cluster manager. The bug in this scenario is that this case can be triggered when the user uses Interactive Beam in a way that automatically cleans up an individual pipeline (e.g. running InteractiveRunner() using a `with` clause).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

everyone,\r\nThis is a companion PR to [PR16609](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16609)\r\n\r\nUserScore and HourlyTeamScore have been updated to better mimic the way the examples would be executed: instead of getting the data from memory, it is now being pulled from a csv file.\r\n\r\nHi @kileys! Adding you as a reviewer for this one, since it looks like you'll be also reviewing PR16609.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the tests for DataTokenization, LeaderBoard and StatefulTeamScore will be submitted in another PR, but wanted to get these two out there since they are already working as expected.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

features of codecov to avoid overwriting codecov.\r\n- Flag the different uploads (go and python) so they are merged, and not clobbered.\r\n- Update the Go SDK upload to use the github action, rather than the decommissioned bash script.\r\n\r\nIn particular, Go SDK coverage is presently lower than python, and Go uploads would overwrite a previous python upload entirely. Codecov has a [flags](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/flags) mechnaism for this that segments uploads into their own groups, and merges everything at the top level.\r\n\r\nFurther, we likely want to have carryforward enabled, since not all tests are run on every run, avoiding weird \"0%\" coverage messages, when very little was changed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
