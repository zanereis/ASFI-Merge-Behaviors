the server status is set to \"online\" before all of the startup tasks have completed. This tells users incorrect facts about the system and its availability.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of `ServerLauncher.start()` so that it waits for all of the asynchronous startup tasks to complete before returning the \"online\" status. The GFSH \"start server\" command relies on this status, so this PR also has the effect of making the command wait for all startup tasks to complete before returning.\r\n\r\nPlease review @kirklund

To make that possible, `ClientClusterManagementService` now raises `ClusterManagemementException` for any non-successful status, and `LocatorClusterManagementService` now wraps throw exceptions in `ClusterManagemementException` where necessary to be consistent with the client side.

'member.region.entries' gauge in `RegionPerfStats`:\r\n- Add region.name and data.policy tags\r\n- Configure the member.region.entries gauge to fetch from new `getLocalSize()` method (see below).\r\n- Configure the 'entryCount' stat to be supplied by new `getLocalSize()` method.\r\n\r\nAdd `getLocalSize()` method to `InternalRegion`, and implement it in `LocalRegion` and `PartitionedRegion`\r\n- In `LocalRegion`, the method returns the region map size minus the number of tombstones.\r\n- In `PartitionedRegion`, the method sums the local sizes of all local bucket regions.\r\n\r\nAlso refactored the following:\r\n- Reorganize `CachePerfStats`/`RegionPerfStats` constructors\r\n- Remove `CachePerfStats.getEntries()`\r\n- Remove use of `CachePerfStats.getEntries()` from `PartitionedRegionStatus`.\r\n- Add `@Override` to `ValidatingStatisticsType` methods in `StatisticsTypeImpl`\r\n- Extracted `invokeSuppliers()` to new `SuppliableStatistics` interface and rename as `updateSuppliedValues()`\r\n- Move responsibility to prepend 'RegionStats-' onto region statistics textID into the classes that create `RegionPerfStats` and `CachePerfStats`.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by:

PR narrows the effort of GEODE-6883 to focus only on the \"gms\"\r\npackage and its subpackages.  Other membership classes in\r\norg.apache.geode.distributed.internal.membership are Geode interfaces,\r\nadapters and factories.  Classes in \"gms\" are membership\r\nclasses/interfaces that should not refer to anything outside of \"gms\"\r\n(though they still do).\r\n\r\nThis PR is otherwise focused on removing references to\r\nInternalDistributedMember and DistributionMessage from \"gms\".\r\n\r\n    GMS classes only refer to GMSMember\r\n    GMS classes use GMSMembershipView.  NetView is now an interface\r\n    GMS classes do not refer to DistributionMessage.  JGroupsMessenger\r\n      expects GMSMessage instances.  Geode messages to be sent over UDP\r\n      are wrapped in a GMSMessageAdapter.\r\n    Message classes in the \"gms\" packages extend AbstractGMSMessage which implements GMSMessage\r\n    GMSMembershipManager has an inner class that implements the GMS Manager\r\n      interface and is now in the \"adapter\" package\r\n    GMSMembershipManager translates GMSMembershipView into a MembershipView\r\n      for the rest of Geode to use (this is the old NetView class)\r\n    GMS instantiation allows us to inject the Manager into the new Services\r\n      instance.\r\n    Other adapter classes have been added to translate between Geode\r\n      and GMS.\r\n\r\n    GMSUtil has new methods for marshalling/unmarshalling\r\n    InternalDistributedMember instances for backward-compatibility.\r\n    GMSMember now has the same on-wire form as\r\n    InternalDistributedMember.  This allows the GMS classes to\r\n    deserialize a message from a pre-1.10 member whose code writes\r\n    InternalDistributedMembers when serializing something like a\r\n    JoinRequest.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR is in addition to the previous checkin made with GEODE-6798:\r\nCommit 0b2f2c248c38b54c59df638315b37ad9ffc604af in geode's branch refs/heads/develop from agingade\r\n\r\nThe previous checkin introduced performance degradation, observed due to garbage collection. Before the refactoring changes the ExecuteRegionFunctionOpImpl instance was created as needed; in the refactoring code it was created all the time, resulting in excess garbage. This PR addresses the issue by using Supplier instance, that creates the ExecuteRegionFunctionOpImpl as and when needed.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [Y] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

a prerequisite to adding long-running operations like `rebalance` to `ClusterManagementService`, a new framework is needed.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new `startOperation` API in `ClusterManagementService` and a registry of supported `ClusterManagementOperation`s and performers in `OperationManager`.  The Java API returns a `CompletableFuture` for callers to append next stages after their long-running operations complete, while the REST interface returns a status URI for further monitoring.","created_at":"2019-07-12T22:59:06Z","updated_at":"2019-07-19T00:50:20Z","closed_at":"2019-07-19T00:50:14Z","merged_at":"2019-07-19T00:50:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd2c091497efe29b40e9a4b42831a59767e0dd44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/10711398a48569f1d009498b60922b631797b93a","head":{"label":"onichols-pivotal:GEODE-6897-rebalance","ref":"GEODE-6897-rebalance","sha":"10711398a48569f1d009498b60922b631797b93a","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114800905,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4MDA5MDU=","name":"geode","full_name":"onichols-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

is refactoring work necessary as a prerequisite to build out async operation framework and rebalance command.\r\n\r\nAs we have expanded what our CMS API can return, ClusterManagementResult has accreted a variety of unrelated fields, as well as a long list of generic types.   After adding rebalance, ClusterManagementResult would now have fields for\r\n* result code & message & HATEOS uri\r\n* RealizationResult[] member_status\r\n* ConfigurationResult<T, R>[] result\r\n* AsyncOperationResult<V> operationResult\r\n* R[] runtimeResult\r\nand generics types:\r\n* T (extends CacheElement) \r\n* R (extends RuntimeInfo)\r\n* V (extends JsonSerializable)\r\nThis PR splits this into subclasses:\r\n* ClusterManagementResult will have all the non-generic stuff\r\n* ClusterManagementListResult will have the T and R generics\r\n* ClusterManagementOperationResult will have the V generics\r\nThis will rely on a small bit of json sleight-of-hand where controller advisors may serialize a ClusterManagementResult (on error) but it will be deserialized as a subtype just with empty subtype fields (e.g. empty result) which should be fine in
