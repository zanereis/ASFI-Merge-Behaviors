for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds a new property `spark.master.rest.auth.mode` which accepts 2 values:\r\n* `None`: No auth mechanism is at play, this causes spark to fail (as it does today) when using properties `spark.authenticate`\r\n* `SecureGateway`: User is telling us they are covering all authentication/authorisation to the rest submission server resource.\r\n* Unknown values default to None providing backward compatibility to config in versions 3x.\r\n* Choose not to expose this on the UI - it doesn't feel need-to-know, let me know if reviewers prefer it is displayed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRight now, when enabling the rest submission server, there are validations (sensible ones) that prevent the user from running the master server if configuration if set for `spark.authenticate` contains a key. It's completely possible a user wants to do use spark.authenticate for other facets of spark, while providing their own gateway to the submission server. We need a way to specify in configuration that the responsibility is not with spark in this deployment.\r\n\r\nThere are reasons why I feel providing authentication within the rest submission server itself would be unnecessary/limiting/undesirable. I debated with myself on the Jira ticket about piggybacking `spark.authenticate` props but my overall conclusion is to not do that. In consistency with the rest of the security guidance, we instead enable users to think about this properly themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is well established to delegate front-door authentication responsibilities to a gateway/proxy service, which can then act as a secure gateway/proxy to the spark master. This could be done trivially using tools like Nginx to provide authentication flexibly, and in a way that is decoupled from any spark distribution supporting this setting. Auth is an area where people often have their own strict requirements too - it opens a can of requirement worms doing _something_.\r\n\r\nTo be fully flexible enough to meet everyones requirements via spark source alone we'd likely end up with bloat, not used by most as best case outcome. The additional concern about doing this handling is ource is maintenance of authentication. it could be a sensitive/risk area of the solution that simply does not need to be introduced for now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo breaking change, but new configuration options that can be utilised. By default we select the mode `None` which provides no change. However, new options are doc'd/public scope so that a user can easily toggle the secure gateway mode on. If an unsupported mode is provided, we default to None opposed to throwing a critical error/handling this via require.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExtends on master suite and adds a new suite for somebody to easily extend this in future, providing direct and indirect coverage of the new methods/logic. In addition, tested manually.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR follows https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46245 to add support `udaf.toColumn` API in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nHere we introduce a new Protobuf message, `proto.TypedAggregateExpression`, that includes a serialized UDF packet. On the server, we unpack it into an `Aggregator` object and generate a real `TypedAggregateExpression` instance with the encoder information passed along with the UDF.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause the `toColumn` API is not supported in the previous PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, from now on users could create typed UDAF using `udaf.toColumn` API/.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNope.","created_at":"2024-06-03T10:13:31Z","updated_at":"2024-07-17T04:07:14Z","closed_at":"2024-07-12T11:21:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f758470142f7b70fc928e9fddc7abc93836b169","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be73aea082867d950638d18e376f906cb44136c3","head":{"label":"xupefei:connect-udaf-tocolumn","ref":"connect-udaf-tocolumn","sha":"be73aea082867d950638d18e376f906cb44136c3","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCompression codec short names, e.g. map statuses, broadcasts, shuffle, parquet/orc/avro outputs, are case insensitive except for event logging. Calling `org.apache.spark.io.CompressionCodec.getShortName` causes this issue.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we make `CompressionCodec.getShortName` handle case sensitivity correctly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes CheckAnalysis to reject invalid scalar subquery group-bys that were previously allowed and returned wrong results.\r\n\r\nFor example, this query is not legal and should give an error, but instead we incorrectly allowed it and it returns wrong results prior to this PR (full repro with table data in the jira):\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect *, (select count(*) from y where y1 > x1 group by y1) from x;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt returns two rows, even though there's only one row of x. The correct result is an error, because there is more than one row returned by the scalar subquery.\r\n\r\nAnother problem case is if the correlation condition is an equality but it's under another operator like an OUTER JOIN or UNION. Various other expressions that are not equi-joins between the inner and outer fields hit this too, e.g. `where y1 + y2 = x1 group by y1`. See the comments in the code and the tests for more examples.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the logic which checks for valid vs invalid group-bys. However, note that this new logic may block some queries that are actually valid, for example `a + 1 = outer(b)` is valid but would be rejected. Therefore, we add a conf flag that can be used to restore the legacy behavior, as well as logging for when the legacy behavior is used and differs from the new behavior. (In general, to accurately run valid queries and reject invalid queries, the check must be moved from compile-time to run-time - see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48501.)\r\n\r\nThis is a longstanding bug. The bug is in CheckAnalysis in checkAggregateInScalarSubquery. It allows grouping columns that are present in correlation predicates, but doesn’t check whether those predicates are equalities -  because when that code was written, non-equality correlation wasn’t allowed. Therefore, this bug has existed since non-equality correlation was added (~2 years ago).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix invalid queries returning wrong results\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, block subqueries with invalid group-bys.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-06-03T00:00:29Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T17:51:15Z","closed_at":"2024-06-03T17:51:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90a6928fe0d313a8ef76347a1602f140fbf43a9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0c4f686e2ba838a5d96ae72093bcba4aae4374d0","head":{"label":"jchen5:scalar-subq-gby","ref":"scalar-subq-gby","sha":"0c4f686e2ba838a5d96ae72093bcba4aae4374d0","user":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558995069,"node_id":"R_kgDOIVGWfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"jchen5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a small follow-up to #46529. It fixes a known issue affecting PyArrow Tables passed to `spark.createDataFrame()`. After this PR, if the user is running PyArrow 17.0.0 or higher, null values in MapArray columns containing nested fields or timestamps will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore this PR, null values in MapArray columns containing nested fields or timestamps are replaced by empty lists when a PyArrow Table is passed to `spark.createDataFrame()`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt prevents loss of nulls in the case described above. There are no other user-facing changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA test is included.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-06-02T14:31:28Z","updated_at":"2024-06-16T05:12:07Z","closed_at":"2024-06-16T05:12:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d1f776991c8cc3299677a9cd4c9c839cd88873d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46837/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46837/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46837/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/63530af6efaa6c8a18cf038163c8073a3cfb3a42","head":{"label":"ianmcook:SPARK-48302","ref":"SPARK-48302","sha":"63530af6efaa6c8a18cf038163c8073a3cfb3a42","user":{"login":"ianmcook","id":280509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook","html_url":"https://github.com/ianmcook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":771149486,"node_id":"R_kgDOLfbOrg","name":"spark","full_name":"ianmcook/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ianmcook","id":280509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook","html_url":"https://github.com/ianmcook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianmcook/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ianmcook/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* Avoid `AttributeError` (see examples below) when mixing Spark DataFrame & Pandas or Pandas-on-Spark DataFrame in `assertDataFrameEqual` by flowing into `_assert_pandas_almost_equal`/`_assert_pandas_equal` instead of `assertAlmostEqual`/`assertEqual`.\r\n* In `PandasOnSparkTestUtils.assert_eq`, applied the Pandas-on-Spark flow for both params `left` and `right`, instead of only `left`, and clarified the error to specify that a Pandas or Pandas-on-Spark object is expected, since which is not immediately obvious from the current error: `DataFrame, DataFrame, Series, Series, IndexIndex`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n* `assertDataFrameEqual` results in `AttributeError` when providing a Spark DataFrame as the first argument and a Pandas DataFrame or a Pandas-on-Spark DataFrame as the second argument (when not inheriting from unittest).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n* Better errors will be raised in the situation described above:\r\n  * `PySparkAssertionError` with a message is raised instead of `AttributeError`.\r\n  * `PySparkAssertionError` error when mixing Spark & Pandas-on-Spark DataFrames is consistently raised in `PandasOnSparkTestUtils.assert_eq`, regardless of which one is left or right.\r\n  * Clarified error message `Expected type DataFrame, DataFrame, Series, Series, IndexIndex,  for ...` -> `Expected type Pandas or Pandas-on-Spark DataFrame, Series, or Index for ...`\r\n\r\n#### Setup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyspark.pandas as ps\r\nfrom

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor some data sources, CHAR type padding is not applied on both the write and read sides (by disabling `spark.sql.readSideCharPadding`), as a different SQL flavor, which is similar to MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/char.html \r\n\r\nHowever, there is a bug in Spark that we always pad the string literal when comparing CHAR type and STRING literals, which assumes the CHAR type columns are always padded, either on the write side or read side. This is not always true.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes Spark always pad the CHAR type columns when comparing with string literals, to satisfy the CHAR type semantic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbug fix if people disable read side char padding\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. After this PR, comparing CHAR type with STRING literals follows the CHAR semantic, while before it mostly returns false.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd dedicated node to represent empty relation (**AQE only**, i.e., `AQEPropagateEmptyRelation.scala`).\r\n- `logical.EmptyRelation`\r\n- `execution.EmptyRelationExec`\r\n\r\nboth are leaf node and store the eliminated logical plan as a field.\r\n\r\nIn order to display the plan in spark UI, I extended `SparkPlanInfo` to support mix of logical and physical plan.\r\n\r\n#### Spark UI\r\n\r\n<img width=\"818\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-07 at 12 50 33 PM\"

`LocalTableScan` in case of empty relation propagation, which lost the information about the original query plan and make it less human readable. The idea is to create a dedicated `EmptyRelation` node which is a leaf node but wraps the original query plan inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNO","created_at":"2024-05-31T22:04:35Z","updated_at":"2024-06-19T08:03:46Z","closed_at":"2024-06-19T08:03:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"49f3aeb9434b52f5fee14d0dc931d056c9d2fd08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46830/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46830/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46830/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d0ca18748b6212d9ac0f7ac873bec3e292d21488","head":{"label":"liuzqt:SPARK-48466","ref":"SPARK-48466","sha":"d0ca18748b6212d9ac0f7ac873bec3e292d21488","user":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":511387078,"node_id":"R_kgDOHnslxg","name":"spark","full_name":"liuzqt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `JavaUtils.timeStringAs` and `JavaUtils.byteStringAs` to use static `Pattern` instances instead of recompiling the regexes on every call.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTiny perf. optimization. This isn't a huge overhead in the grand scheme of things, but it surfaced during some other profiling work and is straightforward to address via static Pattern instances.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request proposes enhancing the Python Datasource Reader by adding an option to yield Arrow batches directly. This change aims to significantly improve performance compared to the existing approach of using tuples or Rows. The implementation takes advantage of the existing work with MapInArrow (referenced in SPARK-46253).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed to address performance issues in the Python Datasource Reader. The current method of sending data as tuples or Rows is inefficient, leading to slower data processing times. By allowing the Datasource Reader to yield Arrow batches directly, we can use the more efficient Arrow format, significantly speeding up data processing. Tests have shown this approach to be up to 8x faster (in a preliminary test with a High Energy Physics Datasource reader for the ROOT data format), particularly benefiting use cases involving large datasets.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR introduces a user-facing change by adding an option to the Python Datasource Reader that allows users to yield Arrow batches directly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA new test was added to the Python Datasource test suite. Additionally, it was manually tested using a custom Python datasource for performance testing.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the TimeMode None from supported time modes in TransformWithState operator. A structured streaming query works in either Processing time mode, or event Time mode depending on whether eventTime has been specified, hence this change aligns TimeMode properly with Streaming query semantics. \r\n\r\nNote that if eventTimeColumn is specified for output dataset in transformWithState operator. TimeMode defaults to EventTime. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed to align TimeMode values with how time flows in Streaming query. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, modifies the TimeMode semantic for transformWithState. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAll existing unit test pass. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR aims to use the method `A` (see below) to output the parameters when we execute a command similar to `sh bin/spark-shell --verbose`, rather than using the method `B` (see below) to output them. (When doing structured log migration, we `ignored` this special logic and broke the `original` logic. Now we need to fix it.)\r\n\r\nMethod A:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4360ec733d248b62798a191301e2b671f7bcfbd5/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#L1108-L1112\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/114164bd3f6bfb67e58f8ead93c5bba0d08b8a0a/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/CommandLineUtils.scala#L38\r\n\r\nMethod B:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/114164bd3f6bfb67e58f8ead93c5bba0d08b8a0a/common/utils/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/Logging.scala#L180\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/114164bd3f6bfb67e58f8ead93c5bba0d08b8a0a/common/utils/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/Logging.scala#L240\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/114164bd3f6bfb67e58f8ead93c5bba0d08b8a0a/common/utils/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/Logging.scala#L260\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- In our structured log migration of the `SparkSubmit` class, we `overlooked` the `special logic of this class`, which overloads `logInfo`, `logWarning` and `logError`. \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4360ec733d248b62798a191301e2b671f7bcfbd5/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#L1100-L1112\r\n\r\nTheir `real purpose` is to print message to `System.err` (`CommandLineLoggingUtils#printMessage`), as follows:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/114164bd3f6bfb67e58f8ead93c5bba0d08b8a0a/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/CommandLineUtils.scala#L35-L38\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build/sbt -Phadoop-3

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to exclude streaming Dataset from the target of OptimizeOneRowPlan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe rule should not be applied to streaming source, since the number of rows it sees is just for current microbatch. It does not mean the streaming source will ever produce max 1 rows during lifetime of the query.\r\n\r\nSuppose the case: the streaming query has a case where batch 0 runs with empty data in streaming source A which triggers the rule with Aggregate, and batch 1 runs with several data in streaming source A which no longer trigger the rule.\r\n\r\nIn the above scenario, this could fail the query as stateful operator is expected to be planned for every batches whereas here it is planned \"selectively\".\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but the behavior can be reverted back with a new config, `spark.sql.streaming.optimizeOneRowPlan.enabled`, although I believe there should be really rare case where users have to turn the config on.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-31T09:06:59Z","updated_at":"2024-06-01T06:36:17Z","closed_at":"2024-06-01T06:15:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3bf676ad7a239273d66292fa088d128792e2a42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMigrate logging with variables of the Spark `RPackageUtils` module to structured logging framework. This transforms the log* entries of APIs like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef logWarning(msg: => String): Unit\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\ndef logWarning(entry: LogEntry): Unit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo enhance Apache Spark's logging system by implementing structured logging.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, Spark core logs will contain additional MDC\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCompiler and scala style checks, as well as code review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nBrief but appropriate use of GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNarrow down `PropagationEmptyRelation` matching pattern from \"non `LocalRelation` `LeafNode`\" to \"`LogicalQueryStage` that contains direct `QueryStageExec`\", which still allows partial aggregate empty relation to be propagated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe should avoid no-op empty relation propagation in AQE: if we convert an empty QueryStageExec to empty relation, it will further wrapped into a new query stage and execute -> produce empty result -> empty relation propagation again. This issue is currently not exposed because AQE will try to reuse shuffle.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt is a performance optimization for PySpark. For the context, `sc._jvm` is a `JVMView` object in Py4J. It has an overloaded `__getattr__` implementation ([source](https://github.com/py4j/py4j/blob/master/py4j-python/src/py4j/java_gateway.py#L1741)). Accessing `.functions` internally sends a command to the Py4J server. The server then searches through a list of imports to find a package that contains the `functions` class ([source](https://github.com/py4j/py4j/blob/master/py4j-java/src/main/java/py4j/reflection/TypeUtil.java#L249)), and will eventually find `org.apache.spark.sql.functions`. The failed reflection attempts are much more expensive than the last successful reflection. Instead, we can directly use this fully qualified class name and prevent all failed reflection attempts.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt improves the performance in PySpark when building large `DataFrame`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\nThe following code can verify the performance improvement:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\n  T = datetime.now()\r\n  df = spark.range(0, 10).agg(F.array([F.sum(F.col(\"id\")) for i in range(0, 500)]))\r\n  print(datetime.now() - T)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn local PySpark shell, the time consumption before/after the optimization is about 1s/0.5s.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-30T14:56:54Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T23:22:21Z","closed_at":"2024-05-30T23:22:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0d584ed5198c51e06c62f699865f4928dc3d391","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b96407731dcb1cda96d00f8a083c0bfff7b15151","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:optimize_get_jvm_function","ref":"optimize_get_jvm_function","sha":"b96407731dcb1cda96d00f8a083c0bfff7b15151","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db/oss","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3.

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, we improve documentation and usage guide for the history server by:\r\n- Identify and print **unrecognized options** specified by users\r\n- Obtain and print all history server-related configurations dynamically instead of using an incomplete, outdated hardcoded list.\r\n- Ensure all configurations are documented for the usage guide\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Revise the help guide for the history server to make it more user-friendly. Missing configuration in the help guide is not always reachable in our official documentation. E.g. spark.history.fs.safemodeCheck.interval is still missing from the doc since added in 1.6.\r\n- Missusage shall be reported to users\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, the print style is still AS-IS with items increased\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n#### without this pr\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: ./sbin/start-history-server.sh [options]\r\n24/05/30 15:37:23 INFO SignalUtils: Registering signal handler for TERM\r\n24/05/30 15:37:23 INFO SignalUtils: Registering signal handler for HUP\r\n24/05/30 15:37:23 INFO SignalUtils: Registering signal handler for INT\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --properties-file FILE      Path to a custom Spark properties file.\r\n                              Default is conf/spark-defaults.conf.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options can be set by setting the corresponding JVM system property.\r\nHistory Server options are always available; additional options depend on the provider.\r\n\r\nHistory Server options:\r\n\r\n  spark.history.ui.port              Port where server will listen for connections\r\n                                     (default 18080)\r\n  spark.history.acls.enable          Whether to enable view acls for all applications\r\n                                     (default false)\r\n  spark.history.provider             Name of history provider class (defaults to\r\n                                     file system-based provider)\r\n  spark.history.retainedApplications Max number of application UIs to keep loaded in memory\r\n                                     (default 50)\r\nFsHistoryProvider options:\r\n\r\n  spark.history.fs.logDirectory      Directory where app logs are stored\r\n                                     (default: file:/tmp/spark-events)\r\n  spark.history.fs.update.interval   How often to reload log data from storage\r\n                                     (in seconds, default: 10)\r\n```\r\n#### For error\r\n```java\r\nUnrecognized options: --conf spark.history.ui.port=10000\r\nUsage: HistoryServer [options]\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --properties-file FILE                                           Path to a custom Spark properties file.\r\n                                                                   Default is conf/spark-defaults.conf.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### For help\r\n```java\r\n sbin/start-history-server.sh --help\r\nUsage: ./sbin/start-history-server.sh [options]\r\n{\"ts\":\"2024-05-30T07:15:29.740Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"Registering signal handler for TERM\",\"context\":{\"signal\":\"TERM\"},\"logger\":\"SignalUtils\"}\r\n{\"ts\":\"2024-05-30T07:15:29.741Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"Registering signal handler for HUP\",\"context\":{\"signal\":\"HUP\"},\"logger\":\"SignalUtils\"}\r\n{\"ts\":\"2024-05-30T07:15:29.741Z\",\"level\":\"INFO\",\"msg\":\"Registering signal handler for INT\",\"context\":{\"signal\":\"INT\"},\"logger\":\"SignalUtils\"}\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --properties-file FILE                                           Path to a custom Spark properties file.\r\n                                                                   Default is conf/spark-defaults.conf.\r\n\r\nConfiguration options can be set by setting the corresponding JVM system property.\r\nHistory Server options are always available; additional options depend on the provider.\r\n\r\nHistory Server options:\r\n  spark.history.custom.executor.log.url                            Specifies custom spark executor log url for supporting\r\n                                                                   external log service instead of using cluster managers'\r\n                                                                   application log urls in the history server.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is introducing Expression Walker in different forms in order to improve collation testing surface area. The tests added include:\r\n\r\n1. Expression Walker for expression evaluation\r\n2. Expression Walker for SQL query examples\r\n3. Expression Walker for codeGen generation\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCollations introduced a lot of changes to many functions and parts of the code and these tests aim to catch existing errors and prevent addition of new functions without proper implementation of collation support.\r\nTo emphasise the importance of these tests, some of the relevant tickets that were opened as a byproduct of this testing:\r\n\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48472\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48572\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48574\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48600\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48662\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis PR is only related to testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-30T07:25:46Z","updated_at":"2024-07-04T08:12:22Z","closed_at":"2024-07-04T08:12:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ca08596aaa272fc866226bac8cd84cc13d370ffa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dbatomic","id":150942779,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP80Ow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150942779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic","html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bfbc9dcafe1f738813f9d7ee1544859c81539e45","head":{"label":"mihailom-db:SPARK-48280","ref":"SPARK-48280","sha":"bfbc9dcafe1f738813f9d7ee1544859c81539e45","user":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":756245919,"node_id":"R_kgDOLRNlnw","name":"spark","full_name":"mihailom-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a validity check to the StateStoreProvider class before calling its constructor. A new runtime exception was created to report this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a security improvement to a user-facing API. Users are only allowed to use class that extends `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStoreProvider` as StateStoreProvider.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis PR comes with a new test to test that invalid class cannot pass the security check. The fact that other tests in StreamingQuerySuite can pass implies that valid class can pass the check.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-29T17:25:30Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T03:57:21Z","closed_at":"2024-06-03T03:57:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"259db3dffa6327c87f990bb40aa008b38e50c369","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to Implement DataFrameQueryContext in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n1.  Add two new protobuf messages packed together with `Expression`:\r\n\r\n    ```proto\r\n    message Origin {\r\n      // (Required) Indicate the origin type.\r\n      oneof function {\r\n        PythonOrigin python_origin = 1;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    message PythonOrigin {\r\n      // (Required) Name of the origin, for example, the name of the function\r\n      string fragment = 1;\r\n\r\n      // (Required) Callsite to show to end users, for example, stacktrace.\r\n      string call_site = 2;\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Merge `DataFrameQueryContext.pysparkFragment` and `DataFrameQueryContext.pysparkcallSite` to existing `DataFrameQueryContext.fragment` and `DataFrameQueryContext.callSite`\r\n\r\n3. Separate `QueryContext` into `SQLQueryContext` and `DataFrameQueryContext` for consistency w/ Scala side\r\n\r\n4. Implement the origin logic. `current_origin` thread local holds the current call site/the function name, and `Expression` gets it from it.\r\n    They are set to individual expression messages, and are used when analysis happens - this resembles Spark SQL implementation.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45377.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45377\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, same as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45377 but in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSame unittests reused in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-29T11:02:31Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T18:09:30Z","closed_at":"2024-06-18T08:25:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c08b5f4329ee7eb64933cc6f8e84eb30bef775f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62ac773166ea23c73db886dd8e74551257fbc8e9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:connect-context","ref":"connect-context","sha":"62ac773166ea23c73db886dd8e74551257fbc8e9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `CollapseProject.isCheap` to avoid inlining UDFs that contain expensive children.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, such as if the UDF contains an aggregate expression, previously we would also duplicate the aggregate expressions when inlining the UDF. Duplication of the aggregate expressions can cause queries to OOM during execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen storing `decimal(p, s)` to derby, if `p > 31`, `s` is wrongly hardcoded to `5` which is the assumed default scale of derby decimal. Actually, 0 is the default scale, 5 is the default precision https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.13/ref/rrefsqlj15260.html\r\n\r\nThis PR calculates a suitable scale to make room for precision.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\navoid precision loss\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, but derby is rare in production environments, and the new mapping are compatible for most usecases\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to improve `IsolatedClientLoader`, includes:\r\n- use `direct` call to method `getPlatformClassLoader` instead of reflection call to the method `getPlatformClassLoader`\r\n- append `com.mysql.cj` to the default value of `sharedPrefixes`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- In `Spark 4.0`, the `minimum supported JDK version is `17`, `ClassLoader#getPlatformClassLoader` can be directly called. Before `Spark 4.0`, it was necessary to be `compatible with `JDK 1.8`, and the `ClassLoader#getPlatformClassLoader` method of the class `ClassLoader` in `JDK 1.8` did not exist. Reflection was used to enable it to compile through `JDK 1.8`.\r\nJDK 1.8 (Method `getPlatformClassLoader` does not exist):\r\nhttps://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/jdk8-b120/jdk/src/share/classes/java/lang/ClassLoader.java\r\n\r\n2.The package name of `mysql` has changed from `com.mysql.jdbc.*` (is deprecated) to `com.mysql.cj.*`,\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-28T11:37:57Z","updated_at":"2024-09-08T00:25:14Z","closed_at":"2024-09-08T00:25:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d9fdc9cc0a572a31e999cc74f026c6d9a673982","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f1d601840f22e1e3530db3e60c99b648b161e4ba","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-48437","ref":"SPARK-48437","sha":"f1d601840f22e1e3530db3e60c99b648b161e4ba","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCollationFactory has been updated to no longer mark UNICODE as collation that supportsBinaryCollation. To reflect these changes, various tests have been updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, some tests have been (temporarily) removed because StringTrim no longer supports UNICODE collation given the new UNICODE definition in CollationFactory. At this time, StringTrim expression only supports UTF8_BINARY & UTF8_BINARY_LCASE, but not ICU collations. This work is in progress (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46762), so we'll ensure appropriate test coverage with those changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUNICODE collation should not support binary collation. Note: in the future, we may want to consider a collation such as UNICODE_BINARY, which will support binary equality, but also maintain UNICODE ordering.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, UNICODE is no longer treated as a binary collation. This affects how equality works for UNICODE, and also which codepath is taken for various collation-aware string expression given UNICODE collated string arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated existing unit and e2e sql test for UNICODE collation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-28T08:28:23Z","updated_at":"2024-06-06T19:02:03Z","closed_at":"2024-06-06T19:02:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b475b3adfb24bae294554e63042d9aac7269b07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46706 to branch 3.5.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up `mapIdToMapIndex` when the corresponding mapstatus is unregistered in three places:\r\n* `removeMapOutput`\r\n* `removeOutputsByFilter`\r\n* `addMapOutput` (old mapstatus overwritten)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere is only one valid mapstatus for the same `mapIndex` at the same time in Spark. `mapIdToMapIndex` should also follows the same rule to avoid chaos.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nString searching in UTF8_LCASE now works on character-level, rather than on byte-level. For example: `ltrim(\"İ\", \"i\")` now returns `\"İ\"`, because there exist **no characters** in `\"İ\"`, starting from the left, such that lowercased version of those characters are equal to `\"i\"`. Note, however, that there is a byte subsequence of `\"İ\"` such that lowercased version of that UTF-8 byte sequence equals to `\"i\"` (so the new behaviour is different than the old behaviour).\r\n\r\nAlso, translation for ICU collations works by repeatedly trimming the longest possible substring that matches a character in the trim string, starting from the left side of the input string, until trimming is done.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix functions that give unusable results due to one-to-many case mapping when performing string search under UTF8_LCASE (see example above).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, behaviour of `trim*` expressions is changed for collated strings for edge cases with one-to-many case mapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests in `CollationSupportSuite` and new e2e sql tests in `CollationStringExpressionsSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-27T20:45:38Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T16:32:56Z","closed_at":"2024-07-15T08:33:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65e85cca5cc039af9ce26ddb130d2c9a11712221","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d15d92aa9f0b15c879a531756f3f474264bec462","head":{"label":"uros-db:alter-trim","ref":"alter-trim","sha":"d15d92aa9f0b15c879a531756f3f474264bec462","user":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":755209418,"node_id":"R_kgDOLQOUyg","name":"spark","full_name":"uros-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nString searching in UTF8_LCASE now works on character-level, rather than on byte-level. For example: `translate(\"İ\", \"i\")` now returns `\"İ\"`, because there exists no **single character** in `\"İ\"` such that lowercased version of that character equals to `\"i\"`. Note, however, that there _is_ a byte subsequence of `\"İ\"` such that lowercased version of that UTF-8 byte sequence equals to `\"i\"` (so the new behaviour is different than the old behaviour).\r\n\r\nAlso, translation for ICU collations works by repeatedly translating the longest possible substring that matches a key in the dictionary (under the specified collation), starting from the left side of the input string, until the entire string is translated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix functions that give unusable results due to one-to-many case mapping when performing string search under UTF8_BINARY_LCASE (see example above).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, behaviour of `translate` expression is changed for edge cases with one-to-many case mapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests in `CollationStringExpressionsSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-27T20:33:33Z","updated_at":"2024-07-12T14:30:25Z","closed_at":"2024-07-12T14:30:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2cc2f3e9cd9c72c268ec8d23a63e5b0dd4e6f8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae718aadb173cc92dedb3df6c2468751c84e7dce","head":{"label":"uros-db:alter-translate","ref":"alter-translate","sha":"ae718aadb173cc92dedb3df6c2468751c84e7dce","user":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":755209418,"node_id":"R_kgDOLQOUyg","name":"spark","full_name":"uros-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uros-db","id":157381213,"node_id":"U_kgDOCWFyXQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157381213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db","html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uros-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uros-db/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

The considtion is introduced after `collectRootReferenceAndExtractValue` and just removes these candidates. This is problematic since these expressions might have contained `AttributeReference` that needed to not do an incorrect aliasing. This fixes this family of bugs by moving the conditions into the function `collectRootReferenceAndExtractValue`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current code leads to `IllegalStateException` runtime failures. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fixes a bug.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting and new unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its
