What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds a new SQL syntax for `TableValuedFunction`.\r\n\r\nThe syntax supports passing such relations one of two ways:\r\n\r\n1. `SELECT ... FROM tvf_call(TABLE t)`\r\n2. `SELECT ... FROM tvf_call(TABLE (<query>))`\r\n\r\nIn the former case, the relation argument directly refers to the name of a table in the catalog. In the latter case, the relation argument comprises a table subquery that may itself refer to one or more tables in its own FROM clause.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the given user defined table values function:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n@udtf(returnType=\"a: int\")\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n    def eval(self, row: Row):\r\n        if row[0] > 5:\r\n            yield row[0],\r\n\r\nspark.udtf.register(\"test_udtf\", TestUDTF)\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW v as SELECT id FROM range(0, 8)\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n, the following SQLs should

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `CacheManager` refreshFileIndexIfNecessary logic checks if the fileIndex root paths starts with the input path. This is problematic if the input path and root path share the prefixes but the root path is not a subdirectory of the input path. In such cases, the CacheManager can unnecessarily refresh the fileIndex which can fail the query if it does not have access to the rootPath for that SparkSession.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixes the bug where the queries on cached dataframe APIs can fail if the cached path shares prefix with the different path.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a callback in QueryPlanningTracker after either\r\n- analysis is done for eager commands\r\n- planning is done for other queries.\r\n\r\n1.  Ideally, the callback would receive QueryExecution, but there's currently no dependency from [spark-catalyst] to [spark-sql]. \r\n- The tracker is needed for validation in the tests & to improve the usability of the callback. The callback owner does not need to maintain reference to the tracker. This is especially useful as Dataset.ofRows() & spark.sql create execution internally.\r\n-  The analyzed plan is needed for use cases that need to access the plan after the analysis is completed. SPARK-43923 is one such use case.\r\n\r\n3. Added new methods on SparkSession vs default param due to \r\n```\r\nmultiple overloaded alternatives define default arguments\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCommands are eagerly executed after analysis phase, while other queries are executed after planning. Users of Spark need to understand time spent prior to execution. Currently, they need to understand the difference between these 2 modes. Abstract the complexity in 1 callback.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the **sc.setLogLevel()** method only sets the log level on the Spark driver, failing to reflect the desired log level on the executors. With  _--conf **spark.log.level**_  or **sc.setLogLevel()**, spark allows tuning the log level in the driver process, but it is not reflecting the log level on executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis inconsistency can lead to difficulties in debugging and monitoring Spark applications, as log messages from the executors may not align with the expected log level set on the user code.\r\nThis PR aims to propagate the log level changes to executors when  sc.setLogLevel()  is called or send the current log level when a new executor is getting registered\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, but with this PR, both driver and executor will show same log level\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested manually to verify the same log levels on both driver and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd APIs from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41440 to SparkR:\r\n* addJobTag(tag)\r\n* removeJobTag(tag)\r\n* getJobTags()\r\n* clearJobTags()\r\n* cancelJobsWithTag()\r\n* setInterruptOnCancel(tag)\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n* fix a bug in removeJobTag when the last tag is removed (should be left with empty tags, not an empty string tag)\r\n* fix comments to cancelJobsWithTag\r\n* add a few defensive reinforcements against an empty string tag as a result of missing property / removing last tag.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSparkR parity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, introduce the APIs introduced in Scala in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41440 to SparkR\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test.","created_at":"2023-06-26T16:34:24Z","updated_at":"2023-07-03T00:53:35Z","closed_at":"2023-07-03T00:53:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"405cf0bcbcab02fc832f6e1fbc0819132c038075","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41742/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41742/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41742/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c49a2d1c9208647332e4a950e019a9e045d247ad","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-44195","ref":"SPARK-44195","sha":"c49a2d1c9208647332e4a950e019a9e045d247ad","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter further discussion, setting JobGroup in Spark Connect for the scope of the query is not necessary.\r\nUse cases that want to identify Spark Connect queries (e.g. SparkListener events from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41443) should use their jobTag for that instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDiscussion around where Jobgroup should be used. Since there may be only one Jobgroup at a time, using it for Spark Connect queries is prone to being reset by another unrelated user. Better to use the new \"jobTags\".\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI","created_at":"2023-06-26T14:19:54Z","updated_at":"2023-06-27T00:11:36Z","closed_at":"2023-06-27T00:11:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"afb87f82812574082b7ef8bf4d9e3d84da2c50ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41741/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41741/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41741/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb16c530d0e6495fccac24321ec3ce3c4212a505","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-43952-followup","ref":"SPARK-43952-followup","sha":"eb16c530d0e6495fccac24321ec3ce3c4212a505","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the `sql()` method of Python connect client, and support positional parameters as list of Python objects that can be converted to literal expressions.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sql(self, sqlQuery: str, args: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], List]] = None) -> DataFrame:\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n- **args** is a dictionary of parameter names to Python objects or a list of Python objects that can be converted to SQL literal expressions. See the [link](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html) regarding the supported value types in PySpark. For example: _1, \"Steven\", datetime.date(2023, 4, 2)_. The same as in Scala/Java API, a value can be also a `Column` of literal expression, in that case it is taken as is.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```python\r\n     >>> connect.sql(\"SELECT * FROM {df} WHERE

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new analysis rule to qualify the table path before execution to fix inconsistent path qualifying between catalog and data operations\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo fix bugs like\r\n\r\n- CREATE TABLE statement with relative LOCATION w/o table schema will infer schema from files from the directory relative to the current working directory and store the directory relative to the warehouse path. \r\n- CTAS statement with relative LOCATION cannot assert empty root path as it checks the wrong path it will finally use.\r\n- DataframeWriter does not qualify the path before checking\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes.\r\n For table statements with a LOCATION clause or 'path' option, when you specify a relative path, spark now uses warehouse path to qualify both the catalog and data operation. Before this patch, it used warehouse path for catalog mostly and CWD for data.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew unit tests.","created_at":"2023-06-26T04:03:38Z","updated_at":"2023-07-03T01:46:09Z","closed_at":"2023-07-03T01:45:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6580507a3ffc5dc4480ef8b4b2d664c2f2c1a7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41733/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41733/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41733/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/223716b219ea283e3f16184a2d049784fff5dc3d","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:SPARK-44185","ref":"SPARK-44185","sha":"223716b219ea283e3f16184a2d049784fff5dc3d","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":357976080,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTc5NzYwODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"yaooqinn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to increase `PyArrow` minimum version from `1.0.0` to `4.0.0` in Apache Spark 3.5.0 because\r\n- PyArrow 4.0.0 starts to support `ARM64` officially.\r\n- Most user environments are using PyArrow 9.0.0 already. If possible, we had better set the minimum to at least 9.0.0 later because Arrow 9.0 started to support Java 17+ via [ARROW-15179](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-15179).\r\n\r\n### Why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe dynamic scheduler listener keeps track of the number of running speculative tasks.

As a result, Task 1 is speculated again and a SparkListenerSpeculativeTaskSubmitted event is triggered. However, the dynamic scheduler's calculation for the number of executors becomes 3 (pendingTask: 1, pendingSpeculative: 1, running: 1), which is obviously not as expected.\r\n\r\nThen, Task 1.2 starts, and it is marked as a speculative task. However, the dynamic scheduler still calculates the number of executors as 3 (pendingTask: 1, pendingSpeculative: 1, running: 1), which again is not as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr change to use new `functionNameRegex` to fix the following test case in `QueryExecutionErrorsSuite` for Java 21:\r\n\r\n- `FAILED_EXECUTE_UDF: execute user defined function with registered UDF`\r\n- `FAILED_EXECUTE_UDF: execute user defined function`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter

be changed accordingly for Java 21\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n-

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe StructType has some methods that require CatalystParser and Catalyst expression. We are not planning to move the parser and expression to the shared module thus needs to do code split to share as much as code as possible between Scala client and Catalyst.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes adding a utility script that can help increase productivity in error message improvement tasks.\r\n\r\nWhen passing the error class name to the script, detailed information(e.g. error message, source code of the function where the error actually occurs) corresponding to the error class is sent to ChatGPT to request improvement of the error message.\r\n\r\n**Usage example:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nhaejoon.lee@spark dev % python error_message_refiner.py AMBIGUOUS_LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS\r\n[AMBIGUOUS_LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS]\r\nBefore: Lateral column alias <name> is ambiguous and has <n> matches.\r\nAfter: Lateral column alias <name> is ambiguous and has <n> matches. Please ensure that the referenced lateral column alias is uniquely identified, or provide a more specific alias in your query.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDevelopers only need to review the printed Before/After and apply it to the actual code if the content is appropriate. (Of course, extra refining should be done if necessary)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is because the error messages are not consistent enough and do not follow the [Error Message Guidelines](https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html).\r\n\r\nAlthough we provide guidelines for consistent and high-quality error messages, they are not consistently followed in practice. For example, the guidelines state that error messages should explicitly include \"What, Why, and How\". However, there are cases where only the \"What\" aspect is described, such as \"Cannot parse decimal,\" which may not provide sufficient help to users. Therefore, providing a script that improves error messages in compliance with the Error Message Guidelines of Apache Spark would greatly facilitate developers in enhancing error messages and encourage adherence to the guidelines.\r\n\r\nFor example, the error message below only answers for \"What\", but not for \"Why\" and \"How\".\r\n\r\n```\r\nLateral column alias <name> is ambiguous and has <n> matches.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy using the script, developers can improve error messages based on the guidelines, enabling us to enforce adherence to the guidelines and ultimately enhance error messages consistently and with high quality as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot resolve lateral column alias <name> in qualifying expression <qualifying expression> as it has multiple matches. Check the name and qualifying expression to ensure uniqueness and specificity.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error message follows the guidelines by including What (column aliases are not allowed), Why (the error is caused by the use of these aliases), and How (the user can solve the error by removing the column aliases). And also this follows the best practice of using the present tense to describe the error and providing suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere is the full script output suggested from ChatGPT below:\r\n```\r\n[AMBIGUOUS_LATERAL_COLUMN_ALIAS]\r\nBefore: Lateral column alias <name> is ambiguous and has <n> matches.\r\nAfter: To improve the error message \"Lateral column alias <name> is ambiguous and has <n> matches\", I suggest the following:\r\n\r\n\"Cannot resolve lateral column alias <name> as it has multiple matches. Check the name and qualifying expression to ensure uniqueness and specificity.\"\r\n\r\nThis error message follows the guidelines as it includes What, Why, and How, addresses the issue of multiple matches, provides clear language, avoids time-based statements, uses present tense, and avoids sounding accusatory or judgmental.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, to help users understand the context of the error message, we can provide additional detail in the error message by modifying the source code to include the qualifying expression in the error message. For example:\r\n\r\n\"Cannot resolve lateral column alias <name> in qualifying expression <qualifying expression> as it has multiple matches. Check the name and qualifying expression to ensure uniqueness and specificity.\"\r\n\r\nThis error message not only helps users to understand the issue but also guides them towards resolving it. It is crucial to provide clear and helpful error messages to make it easy for users to diagnose and fix issues.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is an effort to improve productivity for developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\nI actually used this script for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41455 , so this can be an in-practice example that demonstrates the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf the client passes Rows as inputs to UDFs, the Spark connect planner will fail to create the RowEncoder for the Row input. \r\n\r\nThe Row encoder sent by the client contains no field or schema information. The real input schema should be obtained from the plan's output.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures if the server planner failed to create the encoder for the UDF input using reflection, then it will fall back to use RowEncoders created from the plan.output schema.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed [SPARK-43761](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43761) using the same logic.\r\nThis PR resolved [SPARK-43796](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43796). The error is just caused by the case class defined in the test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the bug where the Row cannot be used as UDF inputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nE2E

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44134\r\n\r\nWith resource aware scheduling, if you specify a default value in the spark-defaults.conf, a user can't override that to set it to 0.\r\n\r\nMeaning spark-defaults.conf has something like:\r\nspark.executor.resource.{resourceName}.amount=1\r\nspark.task.resource.{resourceName}.amount =1\r\n\r\nIf the user tries to override when submitting an application with spark.executor.resource.{resourceName}.amount=0 and spark.task.resource.{resourceName}.amount =0, the applicatoin fails to submit.  it should submit and just not try to allocate those resources. This worked back in Spark 3.0 but was broken when the stage level scheduling feature was added.\r\n\r\nHere I fixed it by simply removing any task resources from the list if they are set to 0.\r\n\r\nNote I also fixed a typo in the exception message when no executor resources are specified but task resources are.\r\n\r\nNote, ideally this is backported to all of the maintenance releases\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix a bug described above\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno api changes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR follows up on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41625 to utilize the classloader/resource isolation in Spark to support multi-user Spark Connect sessions which are isolated from each other (currently, classfiles and jars) and thus, enables multi-user REPLs and UDFs.\r\n\r\n- Instead of a single instance of `SparkArtifactManager` handling all the artifact movement, each instance is now responsible for a single `sessionHolder` (i.e a Spark Connect session) which it requires in it's constructor.\r\n- Previously, all artifacts were stored under a common directory `sparkConnectArtifactDirectory` which was initialised in `SparkContext`. Moving forward, all artifacts are instead separated based on the underlying `SparkSession` (using it's `sessionUUID`) they belong to in the format of `ROOT_ARTIFACT_DIR/<sessionUUID>/jars/...`.\r\n- The `SparkConnectArtifactManager` also builds a `JobArtifactSet` [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41701/files#diff-f833145e80f2b42f54f446a0f173e60e3f5ad657a6ad1f2135bc5c20bcddc90cR157-R168) which is eventually propagated to the executors where the classloader isolation mechanism uses the `uuid` parameter.\r\n- Currently, classfile and jars are isolated but files and archives aren't. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo enable support for multi-user sessions coexisting on a singular Spark cluster. For example, multi-user Scala REPLs/UDFs will be supported with this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, multiple Spark Connect REPLs may use a single Spark cluster at once and execute their own UDFs without intefering with each other.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests in `ArtifactManagerSuite` + existing tests.","created_at":"2023-06-22T17:22:02Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T02:49:27Z","closed_at":"2023-06-27T01:42:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43f96c83dea0d154c7e6765d6831ba0697c7f30e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41701/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41701/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41701/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e4b67e3fb03026a40615d54c391e23e4c917aac","head":{"label":"vicennial:SPARK-44146","ref":"SPARK-44146","sha":"6e4b67e3fb03026a40615d54c391e23e4c917aac","user":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402021456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDIwMjE0NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"vicennial/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add a sequence of literal expressions to\r\n1. Proto API: `SqlCommand` and the `SQL` relation\r\n2. Scala connect API: `SparkSession. sql`\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41568.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently `SparkSession.sql` in Spark Connect doesn't support parameterized SQL with positional parameters. The changes allow to achieve feature parity with Scala/Java/PySpark APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the changes just extend the existing API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.ClientE2ETestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2023-06-22T15:04:48Z","updated_at":"2023-06-25T17:00:29Z","closed_at":"2023-06-25T17:00:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d0e72fc3fffc83829bf10fe0839b4b5ab8b7837e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e577abca53b2feb224af5a08a82471e3f9c82ae1","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:parameterized-query-pos-param-proto","ref":"parameterized-query-pos-param-proto","sha":"e577abca53b2feb224af5a08a82471e3f9c82ae1","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}",

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the typehints utility to convert python types to spark types, use the variable `tpe` for comparison to the string representation of categorical types rather than `type`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the Python keyword `type` is used in the comparison, which will always be false. The user's type is stored in variable `tpe`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting `test_categorical.py`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend PySpark API and extend the `sql` method by:\r\n```python\r\ndef sql(\r\n  self, sqlQuery: str, args: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], List]] = None, **kwargs: Any\r\n) -> DataFrame:\r\n```\r\nwhich accepts an list of Python objects that can be converted to SQL literal expressions.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```python\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM {df} WHERE {df[B]} > ? and ? < {df[A]}\", args=[5, 2], df=mydf).show()\r\n```\r\nThe `sql()` method parses the input SQL statement and replaces the positional parameters by the literal values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To conform the SQL standard and JDBC/ODBC protocol.\r\n2. To improve user experience with PySpark via\r\n    - Using Spark as remote service (microservice).\r\n    - Write SQL code that will power reports, dashboards, charts and other data presentation solutions that need to account for criteria modifiable by users through an interface.\r\n    - Build a generic integration layer based on the PySpark API. The goal is to expose managed data to a wide application ecosystem with a microservice architecture. It is only natural in such a setup to ask for modular and reusable SQL code, that can be executed repeatedly with different parameter values.\r\n\r\n3. To achieve feature parity with other systems that support positional parameters.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the changes extend the existing API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new checks:\r\n```\r\n$ python/run-tests --parallelism=1 --testnames 'pyspark.sql.session SparkSession.sql'\r\n$ python/run-tests --parallelism=1 --testnames 'pyspark.pandas.sql_formatter'\r\n```","created_at":"2023-06-22T07:15:32Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T13:38:52Z","closed_at":"2023-06-22T13:38:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05f651d87ee830ce3f26c13f42a19bb911d3745c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds descriptive errors for cases when MERGE statements that are converted into executable plans by Spark contain unsupported expressions such as non-deterministic functions, subqueries, and aggregates.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed as the current version of the row-level framework does not support these operations. Keep in mind the new validation only applies to MERGE statements that are rewritten by `RewriteMergeIntoTable`. Data sources that inject their own implementation are NOT affected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFixed an issue that StateManager may get materialized in executor instead of driver in FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec. The ticket that brought this issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40411\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to maintain the `stateManager` as `lazy val` but initialize it earlier in the `doExecute()` to force a lazy init at driver.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBecause without this change, the StateManager in FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec may get materialized in executor instead of driver which would cause unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nIt's hard to write a unit test for this since it involves in both driver and executor which is hard to simulate through a unit test.","created_at":"2023-06-21T21:33:53Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T00:26:52Z","closed_at":"2023-06-22T00:26:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f85b99b29d877e899cfe50f74cca43ccbb5f5972","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

`on` field complained when I passed it a Tuple. That's because it saw that it checked for `list` exactly, and so wrapped it into a list like `[on]`, leading to immediate failure. This was surprising -- typically, tuple and list should be interchangeable, and typically tuple is the more readily accepted type. I have proposed a change that moves towards the principle of least surprise for this situation.\r\n\r\nThe reason it checked for `list` exactly is because `Column` actually is an `Iterable` object because it implements `__iter__`. It only does this because it has `__getitem__` implemented, and this allows it to be iterated over with `iter()`. This caused bad behavior, and so `__iter__` was implemented to raise an exception any time a Column is iterated over. That change was implemented in SPARK-10417:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/8574\r\n\r\nIt happens to also be that Python docs specifically advise against checking for iterability by using `isinstance(x, Iterable)`, and that checking for ability to call `iter()` is preferred. For references:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1952464/in-python-how-do-i-determine-if-an-object-is-iterable\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Iterable\r\n\r\nThere will be no user-facing changes for existing working code. It will only fix code that did not work previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests for:\r\n * `isinstance_interable` behaves as-expected for all combinations of (str, col) and

 ### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr adds a SQL TVF (table-value-function): \r\n`with_options('table', map('foo', 'bar'))`\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n1. Add RelationWithOptions function object\r\n2. Add ResolveRelationsWithOptions rule to resolve that to a Relation, with the given options.\r\n\r\n  ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no way to dynamically configure individual DataSource relations in Spark SQL query.\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of the effort in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34072, and based on the comment there https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34072#issuecomment-968451305, to use a TVF instead of query hints.\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n ### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to upgrade netty from 4.1.92 to 4.1.93.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.v4.1.92 VS v4.1.93\r\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/compare/netty-4.1.92.Final...netty-4.1.93.Final\r\n\r\n2.The new version brings some bug fix, eg:\r\n- Reset byte buffer in loop for AbstractDiskHttpData.setContent ([#13320](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13320))\r\n- OpenSSL MAX_CERTIFICATE_LIST_BYTES option supported ([#13365](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13365))\r\n- Adapt to DirectByteBuffer constructor in Java 21 ([#13366](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13366))\r\n- HTTP/2 encoder: allow HEADER_TABLE_SIZE greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE ([#13368](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13368))\r\n- Upgrade to latest netty-tcnative to fix memory leak

notes as follows:\r\n- https://netty.io/news/2023/05/25/4-1-93-Final.html\r\n\r\n4.Why not upgrade to `4-1-94-Final` version?\r\nBecause the return value of the 'threadCache()' (from `PoolThreadCache` to `PoolArenasCache`) method of the netty Inner class used in the 'arrow memory netty' version '12.0.1' has changed and belongs to break change, let's wait for the upgrade of the 'arrow memory netty' before upgrading to the '4-1-94-Final' version.\r\n\r\nThe reference is as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPropagate proxy settings to forked unit test JVMs.  System properties that start with `http.` or `https.` are copied into the `jvmOptions` of the forked processes, ensuring that required proxy settings are available during the tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRunning a subset of unit tests fail in enterprise environments that have additional constraints on network access that are handled by using a proxy.  Examples of impacted tests:\r\n\r\n- HadoopVersionInfoSuite, test name: SPARK-32256: Hadoop VersionInfo should be preloaded. \r\n- HiveClientUserNameSuite(2.0), test name: 2.0: username of HiveClient - no UGI. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA local CI build was modified to use Spark branches (3.3 and 3.4) that included this change to verify it addressed the test failures.  In addition, logging changes were introduced to verify that the system properties were absent when running the tests prior to the change.","created_at":"2023-06-20T19:16:23Z","updated_at":"2023-06-25T02:28:01Z","closed_at":"2023-06-23T00:29:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88c410384f442f5b0bd1d3c84c031afe9ecdd669","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/48d3686f16706fccdd16dd9ff34fd31d3be72680","head":{"label":"snmvaughan:feature/proxy-on-fork-master","ref":"feature/proxy-on-fork-master","sha":"48d3686f16706fccdd16dd9ff34fd31d3be72680","user":{"login":"snmvaughan","id":374920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan","html_url":"https://github.com/snmvaughan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":593231706,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1v_Wg","name":"spark","full_name":"snmvaughan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"snmvaughan","id":374920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDkyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan","html_url":"https://github.com/snmvaughan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snmvaughan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/snmvaughan/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new way to do subexpression elimination in `EquivalentExpressions`. The main change of the PR is that `ExpressionStats` stores the expected evaluation count of subexpressions split into `evalCount` that records sure evaluations and `conditionalEvalCount` that records expected conditional evaluations.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the expected conditional evaluation count is not the same as how many times a subexpression appears in `EquivalentExpressions` conditionally (conditional use count). The expected conditional evaluation count better describes how likely a conditional subexpression is evaluated and so we can use it easier to define when we should consider a subexpression for elimination (e.g. some kind of threshold is reached).\r\nThe idea behind using expected conditional evaluation count is that if we consider 2 cases where a `c` non-leaf subexpression:\r\n- appears only in one branch of a simple 2-branched `If` expression\r\n- or it appears only in the last branch of a 10-branched `CaseWhen` expression,\r\n\r\nthen the conditional use count is 1 in both cases. But the expected conditional evaluation counts are different. Very likely `c` will be evaluated more in the first case if we consider random input data. Since we don't know the exact probabilities of the branches, for the sake of simplicity all branchings are modelled with 0.5 / 0.5 probabilities in this PR.\r\n\r\nPlease find a related conversation here about the default 0 value of the config: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32987#issuecomment-1258168996\r\n\r\nHere are a few example expressions and the `ExpressionStats` (sure + expected conditional evaluation counts) of a non-leaf `c` subexpression from the equivalence maps built from the expressions:\r\n\r\n| Expression | `ExpressionStats` of `c` |\r\n|---|---|\r\n|`c` | `c -> (1 + 0.0)` |\r\n|`c + c` | `c -> (2 + 0.0)` |\r\n|`If(_, c, _)` | `c -> (0 + 0.5)` |\r\n|`If(_, c + c, _)` | `c -> (0 + 1.0)` |\r\n|`If(_, c, c)` | `c -> (1 + 0.0)` |\r\n|`If(c, c, _)` | `c -> (1 + 0.5)` |\r\n|`If(c, c, c)` | `c -> (2 + 0.0)` |\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Fixes the issue of subexpressions that are surely evaluated only once but there is a certain probability that they are evaluated more. These subexpressions are now considered for elimination based on the newly introduced `spark.sql.subexpressionElimination.minExpectedConditionalEvaluationCount` config.\r\n- Fixes the issue of branch groups in `CaseWhen` and `Coalesce` expressions. Branch groups were used for calculating common subexpressions in conditional branches based on the idea that subexpressions that appear in all elements of a group are surely evaluated once. If we take the `CaseWhen(w1, t1, w2, t2, w3, t3, e)` example then the previously defined (`t1`, `t2`,`t3`, `e`) group made sense, but for some reason the (`w1`, `w2`, `w3`) group was also defined, which didn't make sense because `w1` was also considered always evaluated. Also, some other groups that would have made sense (`t1`, `w2`) and (`t1`, `t2`, `w3`) were not defined.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDAGScheduler will get the preferred locations for each RDD partition and try to allocate the task on the preferred locations.\r\n\r\nWe can remove the duplicate preferred locations to save memory.\r\n\r\nFor example. reduce 0 needs to fetch map0 output and map1 output in host-A, then the preferred locations can be Array(\"host-A\").\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo save driver memory for large job, too many preferred locations may cause OOM.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-06-19T14:14:18.501-0700: [Full GC (Allocation Failure) 2023-06-19T14:14:18.501-0700:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change of this pr is to add a call of `SparkFunSuite#wupdateLoggers` after restore loglevel when 'level' of `withLogAppender` function is not `None`, and under the premise of this change, the UT `Logging plan changes for execution` disabled in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41638 can be re-enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Fix bug of `SparkFunSuite#withLogAppender` when 'level' is not None\r\n- Re-enable UT `Logging plan changes for execution` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

The error will be reported.\r\n```scala\r\nval data = \"\"\"[{\"a\": \"incorrect\", \"b\": \"correct\"}, {\"a\": \"incorrect\", \"b\": \"correct\"}]\"\"\"\r\nval schema = new StructType(Array(StructField(\"a\", IntegerType), \r\n  StructField(\"b\", StringType), StructField(\"_corrupt_record\", StringType)))\r\n\r\nspark.read.option(\"mode\", \"PERMISSIVE\").option(\"multiline\", \"true\").schema(schema)\r\n  .json(Seq(data).toDS()).show()\r\n\r\n// error\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 4 in stage 2.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 4.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 9) (charlottesmbp2.home executor driver): java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 1 out of bounds for length 1\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GenericInternalRow.genericGet(rows.scala:201)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.getAs(rows.scala:35)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.get(rows.scala:37)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.get$(rows.scala:37)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GenericInternalRow.get(rows.scala:195)\r\n```\r\nThe `JacksonParser` wrap row list as a new `InternalRow`. So `FailureSafeParser` can't parse it normally when `_corrupt_record` is defined. \r\nThis PR to make sure `BadRecordException` can cover row list parsed by a string record. Then the `FailureSafeParser` can handle row list one by one.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `SQLQueryTestSuite` and `ThriftServerQueryTestSuite` pass except Pandas UDF tests in Java 21.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTwo Java bug fixes changed the behavior and we need a new test output for those test cases.\r\n- JDK-4511638 changes 'toString' result of Float/Double\r\n- JDK-8282081 changes DataTimeFormatter 'F' symbol\r\n\r\nIn addition, `Apache Arrow` doesn't support Java 21 until now. So, I excluded it with TODO JIRA, SPARK-44097 in Java 21 environment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr add a new `apply` function to `NonFateSharingCache` and change `CodeGenerator` to use the new `NonFateSharingCache#apply` to make `catalyst` module can test using maven.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-43300 introduced `NonFateSharingCache` to `core` module and it only used by `CodeGenerator` which is in `catalyst` module. \r\n\r\nThere are two `apply` funcitons in `NonFateSharingCache` and the input parameter of `NonFateSharingCache#apply` is `com.google.common.cache.Cache/LoadingCache`.\r\n\r\nThe `catalyst` module may use shaded spark-core jar when we do maven testing and in the shaded spark-core jar, the Guava related classes will be relocated from `com.google.common` to `org.sparkproject.guava`, so the input parameter of `NonFateSharingCache#apply` will change to `org.sparkproject.guava.cache.Cache/LoadingCache`, but the catalyst module has not been shaded yet when do maven testing, so `CodeGenerator` will still use type `com.google.common.cache.Cache` to call the `NonFateSharingCache#apply` function, then this will result in a mismatch of input types when do maven testing and maven test will aborted as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nProductAggSuite:\r\n*** RUN ABORTED ***\r\n  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class

org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeGenerator.generate(CodeGenerator.scala:1369) \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this pr add a new `apply` function to break non-core modules directly using Guava Cache related types as input parameter to invoke `NonFateSharingCache#apply` function for workaround, this way can avoid non-core modules Maven test failures caused by using shaded core module.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Manual test\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n build/mvn clean
