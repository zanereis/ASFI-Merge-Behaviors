What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nToday Metadata table updates are done inline/synchronous with the data table updates. Metadata data table updates can also sometime trigger table services like compaction which are also done inline w.r.t the ongoing commit. So, updates in the metadata table are always serial. However, there can be async table services like clustering which are running in parallel with single or multiple writers and can update the metadata table in parallel with the writer commits. \r\n\r\nIn the multi writer case, since we anyway have the lock provider configured metadata table updates are guarded for race. But, the lock providers are not must today for single writer + async table service deployments, leading to race in metadata table updates. Async table service like clustering can race with the metadata table compaction, and can update the wrong delta log file than the right next delta file from the compaction.\r\n\r\nFor the single writer + async table operations triggered from the same process, a local JVM based lock provider implementation is needed.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Adding Local JVM process based lock provider implementation\r\n\r\n - Enabling the metadata table by default\r\n\r\n - This local lock provider can be used by a single writer process with async\r\n   table operations to guard the metadata tabl against concurrent updates.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nNon partitioned dataset has issues with metadata table. This patch fixes the same. We also want to support [optional partition path in Hoodie](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2867), but the scope of that is larger than this issue. So, confining the fix just for the bug for now. Will be tackling the optional partition path later. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFixed metadata table to support non partitioned table for all operations. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nAdded and fixed tests in HoodieBackedTableMetadata to test non partitioned dataset. One of the test includes a large number of commits to exercise compaction code paths. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n#3944 handled logical timestamp type for complex keygen. This PR fixes HUDI-2909 by handing it for timestamp based keygen.\r\n\r\nWhen the new config `hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.consistent.logical.timestamp.enabled` is set to true, consistent value will be generated for a logical timestamp type column like timestamp-millis and timestamp-micros, irrespective of whether row-writer is enabled. Disabled by default so as not to break the pipeline that deploy either fully row-writer path or non row-writer path. For example, if it is kept disabled then record key of timestamp type with value `2016-12-29 09:54:00` will be written as timestamp `2016-12-29 09:54:00.0` in row-writer path, while it will be written as long value `1483023240000000` in non row-writer path. If enabled, then the timestamp value will be written in both the cases.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nToday metadata table doesn't honor virtual keys at the time of compaction because of HUDI-2902 This results in the metadata table with base files having records with meta fields and the delta files records with no meta fields. Better to turn off the virtual keys for the metadata table by default, and lets enable the default only after knowing all code paths are covered/tested for the metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Brief change

In 0.9.0 it was true. we made it false few weeks back, but now, reverting to old behavior just to be safe. bcoz, once this config is set to false, it can't be reverted to true.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n - Fetching partition files or all partitions from the metadata table is failing\r\n   when run over S3. Metadata table uses HFile format for the base files and the\r\n   record lookup uses HFile.Reader and HFileScanner interfaces to get records by\r\n   partition keys. When the backing storage is S3, this record lookup from HFiles\r\n   is failing with IOException, in turn failing the caller commit/update operations.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Metadata table looks up HFile records with positional read enabled so as to\r\n   perform better for random lookups. But this positional read key lookup is\r\n   returning with partial read sizes over S3 leading to HFile scanner throwing\r\n   IOException. This doesn't happen over HDFS. Metadata table though uses the HFile\r\n   for random key lookups, the positional read is not mandatory as we sort the keys\r\n   when doing a lookup for multiple keys.\r\n\r\n - The fix is to disable HFile positional read for all HFile scanner based\r\n   key lookups.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug where the Hudi Kafka Connect Sink does not respect Java-engine-specific configs, particularly the marker type.  By default, Kafka Connect Sink using Java client should use direct markers by default.  Before this fix, that's not the case due to the way of building the configs.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds `EngineType.JAVA` as the engine type when building the write config in Kafka Connect writers.\r\n- Removes unnecessary config item `\"hoodie.metadata.enable\": \"false\"`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nRun Kafka Connect Sink locally and verify that without setting the marker type, direct markers are used.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently when doing Hudi queries w/ Spark, it won't load the external configurations. Say if customers enabled metadata listing in their global config file, then this would let them actually query w/o metadata feature enabled. This CR fixes this issue and allows loading global configs during the Hudi reading phase.\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n  - Modified TestSqlConf to verify the

amplification by using LogFileSizeThresholdBasedCompactionStrategy.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nFor huge table, it has many file groups and each file group size can be more than GB. Therefore, we have to increase the compaction target io size to compact more file groups. However , this parameter is difficult to adjust. If the target io size is large, file groups with small log file size will be compacted, which results in write amplification. If the target io size is small, more file groups with large log file will wait for compaction and reduce the read performance.\r\nBase on the `LogFileSizeBasedCompactionStrategy`, the new compaction strategy filters the file groups with log file size greater than the threshold(500M) when planning the compaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- add
