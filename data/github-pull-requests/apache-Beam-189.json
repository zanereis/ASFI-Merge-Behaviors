support in `DefaultJobBundleFactory`.\r\n\r\nCurrent status:\r\n- `DefaultJobBundleFactory` reuses a set of grpc servers if a new environment shares the same URN.\r\n- `DefaultJobBundleFactory` initializes a set of grpc servers as instance variables and creates `WrappedSdkHarnessClient` from them.\r\n\r\nProposed changes:\r\n- Remove the usage of instance variables and refactor them to an immutable data structure `AutoValue_ServerInfo` to enable thread-safe initialization of `WrappedSdkHarnessClient`.\r\n- Allow multiple sets of grpc servers for each payload of the same URN so that we can use multiple docker images of different URL per language.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format

migrate dependencies from findbugs to spotbugs, with some fixes. There appear to be issues introduced in spotbugs.\r\n\r\n - The change to suppression of a volatile warning was necessary even though it was already suppressed. Something about how spotbugs scopes the suppression made it not work for a nested lambda.\r\n - There is still a failure claiming that the `continuation` parameter to `SplittableProcessElementInvoker$Result` is marked nullable, which is not the case. I have not yet decompiled to debug.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

reusing the format property it was rewriting the regexp pattern so it did not find many cases. This is now fixed. The bad news is that Bigtable and Calcite are also leaking guava into Beam. I think it is really important to try to solve the Bigtable case. Hoping that the vendoring of Calcite solves the other one.\r\nFor Cassandra and Kinesis we are pretty much screwed but these are more specific.\r\n\r\nR: @kennknowles @aromanenko-dev

SQL was successfully compiling and passing tests even though it had a totally straightforward compile-time dependency on commons-codec, which it did not declare.\r\n\r\nI had thought that Gradle made this issue a thing of the past, but it is not so. This adds the capability that we got from `mvn dependency:analyze` plugin. It found the known error and a couple other issues, which may or may not be spurious.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be cherrypicked for 2.10.0 as Beam SQL was nonfunctional for 2.9.0. We can advise on a workaround to simply add the necessary dependency. We also need an end-to-end test that will ensure our shipped artifact works for users.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

few reasons for this:\r\n\r\n - simpler to just read it, as a user\r\n - SQL docs should be uncoupled as possible from Javadocs\r\n - there's plenty of formats that are actually not such a big deal to

issues created in #6181 and incorrectly fixed in #6884 (although this PR increased readability greatly).\r\n\r\nBefore any work on [BEAM-4783](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-4783), GroupCombineFunctions would always use a `new HashPartitioner(rdd.rdd().sparkContext().defaultParallelism());`.\r\n\r\nThe intent was to skip the creation of this `Partitioner` and call `groupByKey()` with no arguments **only** when the new bundleSize option was in use. #6181 actually did the opposite causing performance impacts, and because #6181 had terrible readability #6884 did not fix it correctly.\r\n\r\nI am also hopeful that this can be cherry picked into 2.10 if another RC is created to get the Spark Runner's performance back to the levels seen in 2.7.\r\n\r\n@iemejia

fixes or suppresses all findbugs warnings on the Dataflow worker. These commits should not be squashed. In the event of a need for rollback it should be isolated as far as possible. There _are_ some actual functional changes, particularly where erroneous use of integer division is now double precision division.\r\n\r\nIf they look like potential bugs, there is a Jira filed and linked in a comment. This does _not_ enable nonnull by default, so there are 100+ potential bugs lurking.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nIt will help us expedite review of your Pull Request if you tag someone (e.g. `@username`) to look at it.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status

PR use Gradle to parallel Python 2 and 3 tox as well as integration tests (on DataflowRunner) in Python PreCommit by:\r\n\r\n- Group tests to Gradle tasks under multiple sub-projects:\r\n  - beam-sdks-python:preCommitPy2\r\n  - beam-sdks-python-test-suites-tox-py3:preCommitPy3\r\n  - beam-sdks-python-test-suites-dataflow:preCommitIT\r\n- Build sdk artifact based on copy of sdk sources to avoid a concurrent issue in setuptools when using same `setup.py` (details: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7793#issuecomment-462495172)\r\n- Start Cython tests after other tox tests since the side effects may affect the test behavior and result.\r\n\r\nReduced ~30mins for the PreCommit build:\r\n- Before: 60mins: https://scans.gradle.com/s/irb2zhuymvnms\r\n- After: 31mins:

fixes two things that stopped the build_release_candiate.sh script from succeeding\r\n\r\n - Use a virtualenv to build the Python source zip (later, we should just contribute a trivial change to pygradle to make it doable in gradle so our gradle virtualenv can be used)\r\n - Use SSH URL for cloning, because it is pushed, I think by the gradle release plugin but not the script. That's weird and bad but can be fixed separately.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nIt will help us expedite review of your Pull Request if you tag someone (e.g. `@username`) to look at it.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status

is no reason to allow null here, except for coding laziness in the callers. I fixed the call sites and removed the pointless `@Nullable` annotations. I left a redundant null check in one of the methods just to avoid introducing a new NPE.\r\n\r\nThere are many other methods in this class and its neighbors that accept null where they should not, and many incorrect annotations that findbugs seems to be missing. So I am worried that it would not find a null that was headed for `ByteArrayShufflePosition.of(null)`. That invocation makes no sense, but I would not assume it is impossible.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

\"dataflow_throttled_msecs\" signal to windmill service worker.\r\n\r\nWhen a user reaches their quota limit on windmill service they receive a RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED RPC error which may cause a backlog to build up.  To prevent autoscaling from scaling up workers in this scenario we count this throttled time against \"dataflow_throttled_msecs\" which is reported back to DFE by the worker.  This CL does not include the work in the sizing policy to consume this signal.\r\n\r\nDataflowSystemMetrics:  Adds \"dataflow_throttled_msecs\" as a StreamingSystemCounterName.  While previous throttling has been on a per stage basis this is throttling is not specific to a stage.\r\n\r\nStreamingDataflowWorker: Adds windmillQuotaThrottling counter for \"dataflow_throttled_msecs\" and queries the client side windmillServer for the throttle time before reporting to DFE.\r\n\r\nGrpcWindmillServer:  Keeps track of throttled time.  Adds class ThrottleTimer to handle book keeping.  Adds ThrottleTimer.start calls to streams when a RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED error is recieved.  Adds ThrottleTimer.stop calls to streams when a successful response is recieved.\r\n\r\nGrpcWindmillServerTest:  Adds testThrottleSignal.\r\n\r\nMoved to https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7693 : Also adds the flag --EnableStreamingEngine in StreamingOptions and reports it to the backend in DataflowPipelineTranslator\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

PR implements file loads into BQ from the Python SDK for Batch pipelines.\r\n\r\nr: @chamikaramj \r\n\r\n### Open question\r\n- Need to improve documentation significantly before merging.\r\n\r\n### Features being implemented\r\n- [x] Use of temporary tables for atomicity given a subset of load jobs failed\r\n- [ ] Support for multiple destinations on streaming - **left for later PR.**\r\n- [x] File Loads transform has not been wired up to `WriteToBigQuery`\r\n- [ ] Support for time partitioning - **left for later PR.**\r\n- [x] Support for multiple destinations\r\n- [x] If a worker dies, and the same load job is triggered, it will fail because it willhave the same name as before.\r\n\r\n### Test results\r\n- [PreCommit without multiple destinations

is an integration test that runs a simple version of wordcount pipeline and verifies output file content in Python 3.\r\n\r\nDue to BEAM-6158, the test disables `save_main_sessions` flag. Since it duplicates from the existing wordcout example's behavior, we don't need to run it in existing Python 2 suite. Create `Py3IT` tag for integration tests that's available in Python 3.\r\n\r\nTests are done by running this test using DataflowRunner in Python 3.5.\r\n\r\n@tvalentyn @aaltay @RobbeSneyders \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

(Superseded by #7823)\r\n\r\n(also fixes [BEAM-4776](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-4776) (Java) and [BEAM-4777](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-4777) (Python)\r\n\r\nThis currently sits on top of https://github.com/ajamato/beam/pull/1 (which adds a couple of tweaks to #7624) and #7656.\r\n\r\n[The last 11 commits](https://github.com/ryan-williams/beam/compare/job-metrics-base...ryan-williams:job-api-portable-metrics) (beginning with `add GetJobMetrics RPC, associated protos`) are hopefully well-differentiated, and represent the actual new functionality not covered by the PRs it's based on.\r\n\r\nWith this merged:\r\n- python portable wordcount receives and prints metrics\r\n  - (this requires #7656, which lets wordcount look for `attempted` metrics if there are no `committed` metrics)\r\n- portable VR Flink test cases covering \"attempted metrics\" can be enabled (see last commit)\r\n\r\nSubmitting now to start CI-debugging, and also to seed some design discussions.\r\n\r\nCC: @ajamato @mxm @robertwb @angoenka @tweise \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

the Python ValidatesRunner test `test_flattened_side_input`, the PCollection `side` is materialized to be used as a side input of a transform. `side` is also used as input to a flatten operation together with the collection `side3`. However, `side3` is fused away and can't be reached for the flatten which is not fused due to `side` being materialized.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to materialize all inputs to transforms which use side input collections as input.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK |
