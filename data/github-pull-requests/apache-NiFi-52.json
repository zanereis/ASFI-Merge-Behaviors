Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdds support for GET in ListenHTTP for health check.\r\nGET was not supported in ListenHTTP so when put behind a load balancer, the load balancer could not perform a health check on the HTTP server. This PR fixes that.\r\nGET requests sent to <ListenHTTP_service_URI>/healthcheck return \"200 OK\" with an empty response body.\r\nAccessing the health check service can be difficult if the processor is configured to use 2-way SSL, since some load balancers do not support client certificate handling. For this reason, it is also possible to specify a different port, where only the health check service is available. When accessing the health check service via its dedicated port, 1-way SSL is used at most, as follows:\r\n - If the processor is set not to use SSL, SSL is not used on the health check port, either.\r\n - If the processor is set to use one-way SSL, one-way SSL is used on the health check port.\r\n - If the processor is set to use two-way SSL, one-way SSL is used on the health check port.\r\nWhen accessing the server via the dedicated health check port, no other service can accessed and no requests are supported other than GET and HEAD.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7913 Adds getEnabledProtocols to TlsConfiguration and updates ListenSMTP to call SSLSocket.setEnabledProtocols() when configured with SSL Context Service.  The getEnabledProtocols() implementation in StandardTlsConfiguration supports the generic values of _SSL_ and _TLS_ as well as specified TLS protocol versions.  The getEnabledProtocols() implementation returns legacy TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 only when the configured protocol property is set to _SSL_.  Otherwise the implementation returns either the specific protocol version configured, or the secure supported protocol versions based on the running JVM version.  ListenSMTP unit tests updated to include expected exceptions for misaligned TLS protocol version.\r\n\r\nBased on this implementation, ListenSMTP configured with StandardRestrictedSSLContextService will work as follows:\r\n\r\nJava 8\r\n- TLS Protocol set to _TLS_ enables _TLSv1.2_\r\n\r\nJava 11\r\n- TLS Protocol set to _TLS_ enables _TLSv1.2_ and _TLSv1.3_ \r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

See the published <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\">security advisory</a> for details.</p>\n<h1>Test Runners</h1>\n<h3>[Pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1669\">#1669</a>:](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1669\">junit-team/junit#1669</a>) Make <code>FrameworkField</code> constructor public</h3>\n<p>Prior to this change, custom runners could make <code>FrameworkMethod</code> instances, but not <code>FrameworkField</code> instances. This small change allows for both now, because <code>FrameworkField</code>'s constructor has been promoted from package-private to public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1b683f4ec07bcfa40149f086d32240f805487e66\"><code>1b683f4</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release r4.13.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/ce6ce3aadc070db2902698fe0d3dc6729cd631f2\"><code>ce6ce3a</code></a> Draft 4.13.1 release notes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/c29dd8239d6b353e699397eb090a1fd27411fa24\"><code>c29dd82</code></a> Change version to 4.13.1-SNAPSHOT</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1d174861f0b64f97ab0722bb324a760bfb02f567\"><code>1d17486</code></a> Add a link to assertThrows in exception testing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/543905df72ff10364b94dda27552efebf3dd04e9\"><code>543905d</code></a> Use separate line for annotation in Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/510e906b391e7e46a346e1c852416dc7be934944\"><code>510e906</code></a> Add sub headlines to class Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/610155b8c22138329f0723eec22521627dbc52ae\"><code>610155b</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/b6cfd1e3d736cc2106242a8be799615b472c7fec\"><code>b6cfd1e</code></a> Explicitly wrap float parameter for consistency (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1671\">#1671</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/a5d205c7956dbed302b3bb5ecde5ba4299f0b646\"><code>a5d205c</code></a> Fix GitHub link in FAQ (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1672\">#1672</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/3a5c6b4d08f408c8ca6a8e0bae71a9bc5a8f97e8\"><code>3a5c6b4</code></a> Deprecated since jdk9 replacing constructor instance of Double and Float (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1660\">#1660</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/compare/r4.13...r4.13.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=junit:junit&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.13&new-version=4.13.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/configuring-github-dependabot-security-updates)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nUsing `intValue()` on a Long object can cause the value to be truncated/misrepresented. However no error is thrown by NiFi, leading to unexpected results. If a number is too big to fit into an integer field (even though the schema says the field is of integer type), then an exception should be thrown, for proper handling of the arithmetic overflow. Java's built-in `Math.toIntExact()` does exactly this.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-3669 Add SSL support to Binary Log Client in CaptureChangeMySQL processor.  Introduces new SSL Mode property defaulted to DISABLED with allowed values provided from the binary log client library.  Also introduces optional SSL Context Service property with custom validation to ensure that SSL Context Service is configured when SSL Mode is set to something other than DISABLED.  Includes unit tests to verify the presence of an SSLSocketFactory on the mocked binary log client and the creation of an SSLSocket with appropriate exception handling.\r\n\r\nPR #3456 includes the same conceptual functionality, but it contains unnecessary work to initialize a new SSLContext, does not include any new unit tests, and contains merge conflicts.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-10T19:57:15Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T07:30:23Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T07:30:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7664e0898fb1c429c477d527212eb5dc9b7fc495","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/bb7821bc16897eeebdc1a6b4535d675fd31fd309","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-3669","ref":"NIFI-3669","sha":"bb7821bc16897eeebdc1a6b4535d675fd31fd309","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7777 Added optional Password property to UnpackContent to support decrypting Zip archives using either standard ZipCrypto or AES.  The implementation replaces Apache Commons Compress ZipArchiveInputStream with the Zip4j ZipInputStream.  The Zip4j implementation takes a password, which can be null, and is used only when reading encrypted archives, so existing unpacking capabilities work without any other changes.  The Zip4j implementation introduces a new dependency on net.lingala.zip4j:zip4j 2.6.3 that is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

have Event Type of SEND.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nPer the JDBC spec (see java.sql.Connection), commit() and rollback() should only be called on a Connection if auto-commit is disabled. This PR adds checks before calling those methods, and updates the docs accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7836 Implemented EncryptCMS and DecryptCMS Processors with new nifi-pki-service-api module containing CertificateService and PrivateKeyService Controller Service interfaces.  The nifi-pki-service-bundle contains TrustStoreCertificateService and KeyStorePrivateKeyService implementations based on JKS or PKCS12 Key Stores. The EncryptCMS and DecryptCMS Processors also include standard Cryptographic Algorithm Flow File attributes and cipher enumerations that can support refactoring of other encryption Processors.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here: Noticed when trying to query a rest service for a list of items, only the first record was attached in place and the other records were ignored. This pull request will return the same single record if only a single record is found or a list if multiple are returned. This does change the restlookupservice from implementing the recordlookupservice to a lookupservice<Object>. This works well with the LookupRecord processor since it will fall back on inferring the type in the chance it is not a record.\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nfixes bug NIFI-7842 \r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n**In the expression language, right now, for the substring function:**\r\n\r\n> If the starting index or the ending index is greater than the length of the Subject or has a value less than 0, this function call will result in an error.\r\n\r\n**I suggest to change this behavior and return an empty string instead. Reason being that with the current behavior, an UpdateAttribute would fail and roll back the flow file in the incoming relationship, this could cause back pressure and completely block the whole flow to be running.**\r\n\r\n**It might be worth mentioning it in the migration guide as this changes the current behavior but I still think this is a reasonable change.**\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

handling on malformed/empty strings_\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the `validateAMQPHeaderProperty()` does not handle `amqpPropValues` that are appended and prepended by curly braces, like `{a=b}`.\r\n\r\nNor does the function deal with an empty `amqpPropValues` properly.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly a problem because if the AMQP queue you're reading from with the `ConsumeAMQP.java` processor has a message with an *empty* header, then `ConsumeAMQP.java` creates a flowfile-attribute `ampq$header` of the form `{}` - which causes `validateAMQPHeaderProperty()` to pollute the NiFi error box.\r\n\r\nAccording to [1] the AMQP header attribute is optional anyway, so we need to handle blank entries.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html#messages\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis PR adds some basic focus management to the NiFi UI. This helps those using assistive technologies or keyboards navigate interactive elements on a page. When testing, you’ll notice the following changes: \r\n\r\n* A user is now able to tab through all of the interactive controls on the canvas page. This includes the components toolbar, global menu, navigate palette and operate palette.\r\n* The global menu is now navigable via the up and down arrow keys.\r\n* Focus is now trapped inside of modals as described in the [wai-aria modal best practices document](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#keyboard-interaction-7), as well as some shell dialogs (for example, Bulletin Board and Templates). Unfortunately, SlickGrid applies tab index to hidden elements it generates, which in turn breaks the code that traps focus inside of shell dialogs. This can be resolved by contributing to SlickGrid or switching to another package in the future. I created a [Jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-7828) to track the issue.\r\n* I applied the same :hover styling to :focus where possible, but some elements (such as the breadcrumb and bulletin button) do not have :hover styling.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nIf PrometheusReportingTask can't start (for example, if there's a Jetty issue such as the port already being in use), it continues to be triggered which causes NullPointerExceptions to be logged with no cause. In the case that the PrometheusReportingTask cannot be started successfully, it should throw an exception during initialization. It will continue to attempt to initialize the reporting task (that's handled by the framework), but it will not call its onTrigger method. Some defensive code to prevent NPEs was added as well.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

ticket:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-6301\r\n\r\nThe only class the uses the dependency is `SafeXMLConfiguration`, so I created a new module `nifi-security-xml-config` and moved this class and the dependency there, so that it doesn't get pulled into everywhere that security utils is being used.\r\n\r\nI considered making the module be just `nifi-security-xml-utils` and moving the other XML classes as well, but then there may also be another case where you want to use those classes without using commons-configuration2.\r\n\r\nIn the future we should further separate `nifi-security-utils`.","created_at":"2020-09-11T20:34:54Z","updated_at":"2020-09-12T23:58:34Z","closed_at":"2020-09-12T23:58:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a509e0bdd6b8bba5d86e22d005f5aa3416bf8fd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"thenatog","id":38888042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg4MDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38888042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog","html_url":"https://github.com/thenatog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thenatog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/06835d779b4b08ab67ece747ba432a39dda45bbd","head":{"label":"bbende:NIFI-7802","ref":"NIFI-7802","sha":"06835d779b4b08ab67ece747ba432a39dda45bbd","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48186740,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODE4Njc0MA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"bbende/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbende/nifi","description":"Mirror

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nSome properties in ExecuteSQL and ExecuteSQLRecord (both get their properties from AbstractExecuteSQL) evaluate variables and not flowfile attributes, even though the values are obtained for each flowfile. Instead they should evaluate flowfile attributes as well, this PR adds that capability.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-11T18:23:34Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T19:03:08Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T19:03:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b63a5c946da3b934114104d3ffbe73e62ec0b2ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/280bec8d14dbf4577097edb1d296524102360205","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-7803","ref":"NIFI-7803","sha":"280bec8d14dbf4577097edb1d296524102360205","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nWhen using Kerberos and a load balancer to connect to a database, it is possible for DBCPConnectionPool to return a connection to the load balancer but logged in with the wrong ticket for the target database (this happens in High Availability scenarios). This PR tries to relogin to Kerberos if an exception occurs during connect.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

In general, I followed the patterns I found in the existing implementations, for the cases were not explicitly documented the behaviour follows them, mainly the ones were added with the feature itself (I considered them the most relevant and accurate implementations)\r\n\r\nAs for the organisation of the implementation, I did split the feature into three \"layers\". The package structure follows this as well. In the bottom, there is the HazelcastCache, and the implementation. This layer is responsible to directly communicate with the Hazelcast (via a provided connection) and hide the details of the used data structure. The current implementation is based on IMap, but there is the possibility to change or extend this. Also, the map-like data structure's interface is heavily changed between Hazelcast 3.x and 4.x. In case if the support would be needed for older implementations, wrapping the logic could help to avoid sprawl of the changes.\r\n\r\nThe layer above is the \"cache manager\" (HazelcastCacheManager). This is responsible to create the cache instances and maintain the connection. Currently there are two implementation: one which starts an embedded Hazelcast for easy usage and one which connects to a Hazelcast cluster running outside NiFi. The embedded provides a limited capability for configuration, but it could serve effectively as local cache. Also it supports clustering the embedded Hazelcast instances. The \"standalone\" could joint to any non-enterprise Hazelcast. Note: I looked after how to connect with secured Hazelcast, but as I found it is part of the enterprise package. For now, it was not part of my intent to support that. This layer should hide all Hazelcast specific interface or implementation.\r\n\r\nThe top layer is the actual DistributedMapCacheClient implementation. Depends on both the bottom ones, as the manager is needed for acquiring the cache which it works with. All the NiFi specific logic is within this. AtomicDistributedMapCacheClient methods are supported. The revision handling comes in with this is general for all the entries. A long-based version is attached to all the entries.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Adds basic authentication support to the Confluent schema registry controller; fixes bug #4224_\r\n\r\nA pull request (https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4224) was originally created by @teeberg to resolve this issue, and @alopresto provided code review feedback on 27-Apr-2020, however no additional commits were provided to address the code review feedback.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the code contributed in https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4224 to incorporate the code review changes requested in the original PR.\r\n\r\nCurrent versions of the Confluent Schema Registry only support basic authentication, so support for digest authentication which was present in the original PR has been removed.  \r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is
