Change Logs\r\n\r\nGuard incremental query read paths to prevent skipping hollow commits (un-completed non-latest commits) in multi-writer scenario. This PR migrates `hoodie.datasource.read.by.state.transition.time` (introduced in #7627 ) to a new config `hoodie.datasource.read.handle.hollow.commit` that provides flexibility in handling hollow commits. The following read paths are covered.\r\n\r\n- `HoodieCopyOnWriteTableInputFormat`\r\n- `HoodieMergeOnReadTableInputFormat`\r\n- `org.apache.spark.sql.hudi.streaming.HoodieStreamSource`\r\n- `HoodieIncrSource`\r\n- `S3EventsHoodieIncrSource`\r\n- `GcsEventsHoodieIncrSource`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIncremental query results.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nMedium.\r\n\r\n- [ ] To be validated by UT and e2e testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nInsert into uses bulk insert unless relevant settings explicitly set otherwise.\r\n\r\nThere is an additional change to the test in TestDeleteFromTable.scala because it was using the same table for both iterations.\r\n\r\nI also changed HoodieCDCExtractor because it was putting beforeFileSlice in the spot of afterFileSlice\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBetter out of the box experience for users\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8909\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDeleting inflight and requested files for the commit to be rollback before creating the rollback completed is causing issues if the job fails in between state. In this case rollback cannot be executed and manually rollback files needs to be cleaned, since they again check for existing of the files to complete the rollback. This becomes even more tricky during two phase lock with metadata table enabled.\r\nSo, if we interchange these steps, and the job were to fail after rollback and before inflight files removed. Another rollback would remove those files. \r\nApart from this change also added some refactoring code for clustering and included more unit tests on rollback.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public changing APIs, impact is low.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nRequired documentation is provided as part of the comments within the code, no further documentation is required.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x]

Changed the rollback mechanism for MDT to actual rollbacks rather than appending revert blocks\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch, rollbacks in DT is yet another delta commit in MDT and we mark all files as invalid in the delta commit added. But as we are adding more high scale partitions like RLI, we can't afford to mark 100k entries as invalid. So, we wanted to trigger an actual rollback of the commit of interest in MDT for the delta commit of interest. (similar to how we do rollback in DT).\r\n\r\nHere is the new rollback logic in MDT:\r\nOnce the rollback completes the business in DT, it comes to MDT territory to make an update. \r\nWe do 2 things in here. \r\nLets say the rollback instant is t5.rb and commit being rolled back in DT is t4.dc. \r\na. we trigger a delta commit in MDT with instant time t5_006.dc \r\n    i. Adds any log files added as part of rolling back t4.dc in DT. We can fetch this info from the rollback commit metadata. We will update only FILES partition in this case.\r\n    ii. For FILES partition in MDT, we might need to retain all files in DT so that cleaner down the line will be able to clean up all logs files in DT. This can be fetched from the rollback plan corresponding to the rollback in DT. \r\nb. Trigger a rollback of t4.dc in MDT. This should rollback data in all MDT partitions. \r\n \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes issue related to rollback of various indexes in MDT.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCreating new ConflictResolutionStrategy called IngestionPrimaryWriterBasedConflictResolutionStrategy, to prioritize Ingestion writers over other writers. This strategy also requires replacecommit to be mutable plan and would require SparkAllowUpdateStrategy to be passed in HoodieWriteConfig.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact for the existing flow, this change is introducing a new conflict resolution strategy.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow. Created unit tests to test various scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDid not create new configs, used existing configs. Documentation for the strategy class is given as part of comments.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR contains following changes:\r\n- Includes file creation and precommit validator metrics for clustering\r\n- Checks and skip computing file groups intersection for SparkAllowUpdateStrategy when isRollbackPendingClustering is disabled. This approach is used when Ingestion writers are given higher priority than clustering rewriters. Also, in this approach, clustering plan stored is replacecommit.requested file becomes mutable. So, the caller will automatically take care of doing hard rollback on event of clustering failure.\r\n- Increase the scope for getTransformer method. By increasing the access and scope of the getTransformer method, custom record transformers can be built.\r\n- Remove cache call from pre-commit validation phase and cache the sql results to avoid shuffle. Caching before and after state of the entire partition is causing OOM issues. Also since a join operation is performed for before and after state it is triggering a shuffle operation on both the states. In general, when precommit are configured max one of them is configured and the validation SQLs may contain fewer columns so this commit will basically run the SQLs first for both before and after state. Then it caches the results and run join operation on the results. This way the shuffle needs to deal with very less data and it is much faster.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public facing APIs. If users configured multiple precommits validators for each commit it can deter the performance a bit.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow to medium.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nRequired documentation is already provided as part of comments.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-27T00:38:35Z","updated_at":"2023-05-31T23:29:26Z","closed_at":"2023-05-31T06:39:11Z","merged_at":"2023-05-31T06:39:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c7d856656f3f3a01c073a2aed444d90c740c913","assignee":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719821152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODIxMTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/spark","name":"spark","color":"D9974C","default":false,"description":"Issues

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThere are two issues in the POM for building bundle jars of Spark 2:\r\n- The `spark2` profile generates `hudi-spark2.4-bundle_2.12` instead of `hudi-spark-bundle_2.12` (legacy bundle name).\r\n- The scala profile (2.11 or 2.12) is ignored when building the Spark bundle jar for Spark 2.4.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both issues.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes the Spark bundle jar

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn our company, hudi is used as a platform. We provide deltastreamer (run in continuous mode) to write to a large number of sources (including mysql & tidb) as a long time service. \r\n\r\nWe often need to update the hudi configuration, but we don’t want to restart deltastreamer to achieve it, which may be too heavy for our job scheduler server based on livy/yarn. Therefore, we provide deltastreamer the configuration hot update function. It is possible to update some common parameters instantly, and these parameters will take effect at the next sync of deltastreamer. Here are some parameters can be updated:\r\n\r\n- hoodie.bulkinsert.shuffle.parallelism (used only in bulkinsert)\r\n- hoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism\r\n- hoodie.deltastreamer.kafka.source.maxEvents\r\n- hoodie.memory.merge.max.size\r\n- hoodie.memory.compaction.max.size\r\n- hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.*\r\n- hoodie.compact.inline.max.delta.commits\r\n- hoodie.compaction.strategy\r\n- hoodie.compaction.target.io\r\n\r\nThe flowchart of deltastreamer before and after supporting hot update is as follows:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/19326824/d281a570-eaab-414a-8a76-27da38327d87)\r\n\r\nIn continuous mode, before each sync, will try update properties if needed\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone if not configure the hot update class\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- add a parameter `--config-hot-update-strategy-class` to set the update class. Default empty('') means no update class and will not turn the feature on.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-25T09:46:42Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T09:27:14Z","closed_at":"2023-05-30T08:56:59Z","merged_at":"2023-05-30T08:56:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"91623814132c34f76e46841e6c369356de5df2f1","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded

Change Logs\r\n\r\nImprove update mechanism for HoodieTableProperties. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the update mechanism for HoodieTableConfig has two problem. \r\n\r\nFirst, when fetching configs from file system, when encountering IOEXception, we will check whether the cfg file exists. If not, we will fallback to read the backup file. If the cfg file exists we will throw out the exception as following. \r\n\r\n```txt\r\nCaused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException:path_to_table/.hoodoie/hoodie.properties: No such file or directory!\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.aliyun.oss.AliyunOSSFileSystem.getFileStatus(AliyunOSSFileSystem.java:279) ~[aps-api.jar:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.aliyun.oss.AliyunOSSFileSystem.open(AliyunOSSFileSystem.java:622) ~[aps-api.jar:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.open(FileSystem.java:976) ~[aps-api.jar:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.fs.HoodieWrapperFileSystem.open(HoodieWrapperFileSystem.java:460) ~[aps-api.jar:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.table.HoodieTableConfig.fetchConfigs(HoodieTableConfig.java:331) ~[aps-api.jar:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.table.HoodieTableConfig.<init>(HoodieTableConfig.java:273) ~[aps-api.jar:?]\r\n\t... 27 more\r\n```\r\nThis is because there is another writer updating the config, it will delete the file first and then write it back afterward. \r\n\r\nSecondly, when updating the table config, we have the following code which will create an empty config file first then write the content to it. Reader will find a totally empty config files in some cases so we need to update the config file atomicly. \r\n```java\r\ntry (FSDataInputStream in = fs.open(backupCfgPath);\r\n           FSDataOutputStream out = fs.create(cfgPath, true)) {\r\n        Properties props = new TypedProperties();\r\n        props.load(in);\r\n        modifyFn.accept(props, modifyProps);\r\n        checksum = storeProperties(props, out);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImprove update mechanism for HoodieTableProperties. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Background\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/8544\r\n[HUDI-6129](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6129)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdded `maxFilesPerTrigger`, `maxBytesPerTrigger`, `maxRowsPerTrigger` to control the speed of consuming Spark stream source, the corresponding configuration is `hoodie.datasource.streaming.max.files.per.trigger`, `hoodie.datasource.streaming.max.bytes.per.trigger`, `hoodie.datasource .streaming.max.rows.per.trigger`.\r\n\r\nIt is implemented with the `latestOffset` method of the `SupportsAdmissionControl` interface of Spark3, so versions below Spark3 are not supported.\r\nThe `latestOffset` method is implemented as follows:\r\nGet all `HoodieCommitMetadata` from `startOffset` to `latestOffset`,\r\nStart traversing from `startOffset` (through commit -> partition -> file, that is,` List[HoodieCommitMetadata]` -> `partitionToWriteStats` -> `HoodieWriteStat` traversal), until one of the three conditions of `maxFilesPerTrigger`, `maxBytesPerTrigger`, `maxRowsPerTrigger` is met, get `maxOffset`, and then return `maxOffset` as the `latestOffset` method return value.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nlow\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n【TODO】Documentation needs to be added to describe this feature\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAllow writing the manifest file with absolute path in ManifestFileWriter. Currently the writer only uses the file name (excluding the full path). \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis would make the generated manifest file more flexible, e.g., when a downstream desires full path.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone. The current behavior won't change.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nLeaving inflight files in the timeline can cause various problems. In the past we have seen issues, when oldest inflight commit is the first commit in the timeline.  In that case readers treated the files written by the oldest files as valid. \r\nIn the existing logic there are lot of checks for multiwriter case, pending compaction and replacecommit etc. This proposed change has a unified approach to address all of such cases.\r\nThe change is to keep the timeline intact by finding the greatest completed commit in the timeline that is lower than oldest inflight commit, this commit is called oldestCommitToRetain. And any instant that is greater than or equal to this commit value is not eligible for archival.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nInstead of tracking the oldestInflight commit, now we are tracking the completed commit that is before this inflight commit.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to test the changes.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nThis changes effects internal features required documentation is provided as part of the comments.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the user has to manually downgrade the metadata table from version 5 to 4 (e.g., from 0.13.0 release to 0.11.1 release), when the metadata table is enabled, along with the data table.  Otherwise, if the data table is downgraded from version 5 to 4 only, the following exception is thrown when trying to write to the table using an old release (e.g., 0.11.1).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the logic to automatically downgrade or upgrade the table version of the metadata table to improve the user experience.  New tests are added to guard the logic.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieException: Unknown versionCode:5                \r\n  at

in 0.11.1, add a commit ➝ write a new commit with 0.13.1 ➝ use Hudi CLI to downgrade to 0.11.1 ➝ write a new commit with 0.11.1

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen there is only one file group for a given partition, we should avoid clustering. We added a config `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.single.group.clustering.enabled` to dicdate this. But the logic is such that, if sorting is enabled, and even if this config is set to true/false, we trigger clustering. \r\n\r\nBut revisiting the logic feels, we don't really need to rely on sorting. Even if the data within single file group may not be sorted, we don't really need to sort them, since the stats are going to remain intact before and after sorting (total valid values, min and max). So, even when sorting is enabled, we should not trigger clustering when file group count is just 1. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWill assist in avoid repeated clustering for partitions having 1 file group. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`AbstractStreamWriteFunction` could process watermark from `StreamWriteOperator` and send `WriteMetadataEvent` with the watermark of write function to `StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator`. `StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator` stores the min watermark of `WriteMetadataEvent`s from subtasks into the extra metadata of `HoodieCommitMetadata`. Meanwhile,  `StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator` advances the min watermark for subtasks in which no data has written, and does not advance watermark for commit on empty batch.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n`StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator` stores the min watermark of write function into the extra metadata of `HoodieCommitMetadata` to identify the current progress of writing.\r\n\r\n### Risk

entrypoints\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn Hudi 0.10.X, Hudi assumes that hoodie table properties contains the `hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning` configuration value. \r\n\r\nAs such `hoodie.properties` should contain this config for all Hudi tables created by Hudi > 0.10.X. However, in DeltaStreamer entrypoints, this configuration is not written to `hoodie.properties`, which will cause incorrect query results via Spark.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the aforementioned assumptions by ensuring that  `hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning`  is written to `hoodie.properties`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.
