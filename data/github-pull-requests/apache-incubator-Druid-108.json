seemed not a proper name but I described this as a virtual column, which is not defined in schema but can be retrieved from other columns in a row by select query.\n\nWe are plan to use this to simplify map-like view in Druid. With two dimensions `keys` and `values` which is multi-valued with same length in a row we can make map from them. For example with keys [key1, key2, key3] and values [value1, value2, value3], map type {key1=value1, key2=value2, key3=value3} can be returned to client. \n\nBelow is the query I've used to test.

PR is introducing `dimensions` and `metrics` fields in the output of a `select` query, as the below. Looking at these fields, I think we could easily `find the full list of existing columns` in the whole events and then tell whether those column are a `dimension` or a `metric`. We could also get rid of columns' names which are `repeated in events` lists, so as to `reduce the output size` by means of these fields in the future. This would be especially beneficial when the output is huge and has a lot of records. \n\n```\n[ {\n  \"timestamp\" : \"2013-08-29T00:00:00.000Z\",\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"pagingIdentifiers\" : {\n

all,\n\nThis week working on our cluster we detected a little issue. When we have for example 5 middleManagers and all of them have the same currentCapacityUsed and some of them are disabled, maybe the new indexing tasks can't start.\n\n| MiddleManager | Capacity | CurrentCapacityUsed | Status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AAA | 10 | 5 | Disabled |\n| BBB | 10 | 5 | Enabled |\n| CCC | 10 | 5 | Enabled |\n| DDD | 10 | 5 | Enabled |\n\nOn this scenario, maybe the current equal distribution return an unique middleManager if the middleManager that is returned is disabled. The new tasks can't start and go to pending status.\n\nTo fix the issue I changed the logic inside equal distribution, now sort the middleManager using the currentCapacityUsed but if two middleManagers have the same currentCapacityUsed, them are sorted using the IP

some discussion on how to approach this matter is appropriate, I suspect there will be other changes spawning from this one, or at least more clarification.\n\nThe documentation for batch-ingestion claims that default value for maxRowsInMemory is 5 million, which is not true. It actually defaults to 80000, which in turn is derived from the default rowFlushBoundary.\n\n> _indexing-hadoop/src/main/java/io/druid/indexer/HadoopTuningConfig.java:113:_\n> \n> `this.rowFlushBoundary = maxRowsInMemory == null ? maxRowsInMemoryCOMPAT == null ?  DEFAULT_ROW_FLUSH_BOUNDARY : maxRowsInMemoryCOMPAT : maxRowsInMemory;`\n> \n> _indexing-hadoop/src/main/java/io/druid/indexer/HadoopTuningConfig.java:44:_\n> \n> `private static final int DEFAULT_ROW_FLUSH_BOUNDARY = 80000;`\n\nFurthermore the value defaults to 500000 for realtime/index tasks. Is it sane to have 2 different defaults values for the same config item depending on if it's used in realtime or batch contexts? \n\n> _indexing-service/src/main/java/io/druid/indexing/common/task/IndexTask.java:501:_\n> \n> `private static final int DEFAULT_ROW_FLUSH_BOUNDARY = 500000;`\n> \n> _server/src/main/java/io/druid/segment/indexing/RealtimeTuningConfig.java:40:_\n> \n> `private static final int defaultMaxRowsInMemory = 500000;`\n\nAnother minor part of this is also that other references to the value contain the info:\n\n> Maximum heap memory usage for indexing scales with maxRowsInMemory \\* (2 + maxPendingPersists).\n\nThis is lacking from batch-ingestion.md, but I'm not

PR adds support for Long and Float numeric dimensions.\n\nIt depends on the following two PRs:\n- https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/2263 \n- https://github.com/druid-io/druid-api/pull/74\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Dictionary encoding is not used for Long and Float dimensions. No index structures are currently created for numeric dimensions. Numeric dims will use the existing long/float column formats on disk.\n- The DimensionSelector interface now has additional functions for retrieving rows from numeric dimension columns without dictionary encoding.\n- A new DimensionSelector, UnencodedDimensionSelector, has been added for use with numeric dims.\n- As there are no bitmap indexes on numeric dims, a full scan will be performed on numeric dims for filtering logic that uses filter.getBitmapIndex()\n- To support the requirement above, ColumnSelectorBitmapIndexSelector now supports bitmap generation from the result of a column scan\n- SelectorFilter and BoundFilter can do direct numeric comparisons on Long/Float columns, no string conversion needed\n- Long and Float values will be converted to Strings for any filters or extraction functions that require String inputs.\n- null values for Long and Float dims will be converted to 0L or 0.0F, respectively.\n\nUnit test notes:\n- The druid.sample.tsv file has been modified to include Long and Float dimension columns (market_long, market_float, quality_long, quality_float). The original druid.sample.tsv file has been kept in the repo.\n- The numeric values for these new dimensions have a 1-to-1 mapping with the values in 'market' and 'quality'\n- For larger test suites like GroupByQueryRunnerTest and TopN, I have parameterized the use of the \"quality\" and \"market\" dimensions; in different test iterations, the tests will use the long or float versions of these dimension columns.\n- Smaller test suites have separate functions for testing numeric dimensions.\n","created_at":"2016-02-11T02:12:08Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:35:33Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T01:42:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42c1bf137ccb1ba10ee28e0e8315faacaec5f2a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":182900868,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODI5MDA4Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Discuss","name":"Discuss","color":"ff00ff","default":false,"description":null},{"id":321808195,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjE4MDgxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/18","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/18","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/18/labels","id":1526819,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTUyNjgxOQ==","number":18,"title":"0.9.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":369,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-01-20T19:04:22Z","updated_at":"2017-04-07T07:16:03Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-04-07T07:16:03Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/d60a780fe01dab9160c19b7809ce55405e54bfff","head":{"label":"jon-wei:flex_dims_feb16","ref":"flex_dims_feb16","sha":"d60a780fe01dab9160c19b7809ce55405e54bfff","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41450391,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTQ1MDM5MQ==","name":"druid","full_name":"jon-wei/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei/druid","description":"Column

#2355. This PR is meant to put necessary abstractions inside Druid for enabling authorization as discussed in #2355 \n- Introduce `AuthorizationInfo` interface, specific implementations of which would be provided by extensions\n- If the `druid.auth.enabled` is set to `true` then the `isAuthorized` method of `AuthorizationInfo` will be called to perform authorization checks\n-  `AuthorizationInfo` object will be created in the servlet filters of specific extension and will be passed as a request attribute with attribute name as `AuthConfig.DRUID_AUTH_TOKEN`\n- As per the scope of this PR, all resources that needs to be secured are divided into 3 types - `DATASOURCE`, `CONFIG` and `STATE`. For any type of resource, possible actions are  - `READ` or `WRITE`\n- Specific ResourceFilters are used to perform auth checks for all endpoints that corresponds to a specific resource type. This prevents duplication of logic and need to inject HttpServletRequest inside each endpoint. For example \n  - `DatasourceResourceFilter` is used for endpoints where the datasource information is present after \"datasources\" segment in the request Path such as `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/`, `/druid/coordinator/v1/metadata/datasources/`, `/druid/v2/datasources/` \n  - `RulesResourceFilter` is used where the datasource information is present after \"rules\" segment in the request Path such as `/druid/coordinator/v1/rules/`\n  - `TaskResourceFilter` is used for endpoints is used where the datasource information is present after \"task\" segment in the request Path such as `druid/indexer/v1/task`\n  - `ConfigResourceFilter` is used for endpoints like `/druid/coordinator/v1/config`, `/druid/indexer/v1/worker`, `/druid/worker/v1` etc\n  - `StateResourceFilter` is used for endpoints like `/druid/broker/v1/loadstatus`, `/druid/coordinator/v1/leader`, `/druid/coordinator/v1/loadqueue`, `/druid/coordinator/v1/rules` etc\n- For endpoints where a list of resources is returned like `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources`, `/druid/indexer/v1/completeTasks` etc. the list is filtered to return only the resources to which the requested user has access. In these cases, `HttpServletRequest` instance needs to be injected in the endpoint method.\n\nNote -\nJAX-RS specification provides an interface called `SecurityContext`. However, we did not use this but provided our own interface `AuthorizationInfo` mainly because it provides more flexibility. For example, `SecurityContext` has a method called `isUserInRole(String role)` which would be used for auth checks and if used then the mapping of what roles can access what resource needs to be modeled inside Druid either using some convention or some other means which is not very flexible as Druid has dynamic resources like

intent is to get rid of the need for Curator service discovery to find tasks.\n\n**Motivation**\nCurator based service discovery is annoying because it needs ZK, and also because it doesn't clean up after itself when a service goes away, requiring hacks like this in tranquility: https://github.com/druid-io/tranquility/blob/v0.7.2/core/src/main/scala/com/metamx/tranquility/druid/DruidBeamMaker.scala#L229. This should also make life easier for the ingestion supervisors needed by #2220, as they will likely run on the overlord and will benefit from the overlord knowing where tasks are.\n\n**Intended usage**\nTranquility would use this by implementing a resolver (similar to the [DiscoResolver](https://github.com/metamx/scala-util/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/metamx/common/scala/net/finagle/DiscoResolver.scala) for Curator discovery) that polls the overlord's runningTasks endpoint instead of watching ZK.\n\nOverlord-based ingestion supervisors (like the kafka one implied by #2220) would probably register a listener directly with the TaskRunner.\n\n**Implementation**\n- Add TaskLocation class to represent the peon that tasks are running on\n- Add TaskRunner listeners that make it possible for callers to be notified when tasks move around (this happens when they get

the Avro input row parsers so that complex avro datastructures\ncan be supported. By specifying an extra schemaMappings map in the row\nparser, references to avro fields in the parse spec are translated to\npaths through an avro structure. If the schemaMappings section is not\npresent, then the system works as before.\n\nAn example dataSchema using the new functionality would look like the\nfollowing:\n\n``` json\n\"dataSchema\" : {\n  \"dataSource\" : \"wikipedia\",\n  \"parser\" : {\n    \"type\" : \"avro_hadoop\",\n    \"parseSpec\" : {\n      \"format\" : \"timeAndDims\",\n      \"timestampSpec\" : {\n        \"column\" : \"timestamp\",\n        \"format\" : \"auto\"\n      },\n      \"dimensionsSpec\" : {\n        \"dimensions\":\n[\"page\",\"language\",\"user\",\"unpatrolled\",\"newPage\",\"robot\",\"anonymous\",\"namespace\",\"continent\",\"country\",\"region\",\"city\"],\n        \"dimensionExclusions\" : [],\n        \"spatialDimensions\" : []\n      }\n    },\n    \"schemaMappings\":{\n      \"user\":\"userInfo.userName\",\n      \"language\":\"userInfo.language[0]\",\n      \"country\":\"geoInfo(country)\",\n      \"region\":\"geoInfo(region)\",\n      \"city\":\"geoInfo(city)\",\n      \"added\":\"created\"\n    },\n    \"fromPigAvroStorage\":false\n  },\n  \"metricsSpec\" : [{\n    \"type\" : \"count\",\n    \"name\" : \"count\"\n  }, {\n    \"type\" : \"doubleSum\",\n    \"name\" : \"added\",\n    \"fieldName\" : \"added\"\n  }, {\n    \"type\" : \"doubleSum\",\n    \"name\" : \"deleted\",\n    \"fieldName\" : \"deleted\"\n  }, {\n    \"type\" : \"doubleSum\",\n    \"name\" : \"delta\",\n    \"fieldName\" : \"delta\"\n  }],\n  \"granularitySpec\" : {\n    \"segmentGranularity\" : \"DAY\",\n    \"queryGranularity\" : \"NONE\",\n    \"intervals\" : [ \"2013-08-31/2013-09-01\" ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the avro record being ingested has a field called\nuserInfo which is a record that in turn has fields for user and\nlanguage. Similarly, the record has a field called geoInfo which is a\nmap with entries in it for city, region, and country. Mapping works\nfor both dimensions and metrics, as can be seen for the added metric,\nwhich is mapped to the created field in avro.\n\nThe language for schema mappings is:\n\nMAPPING : fieldName ( SEGMENT )*\nSEGMENT : '.' fieldName\n        | '(' mapKey ')'\n        | '[' arrayIndex ']'\n\nSo each of the following are valid mappings:\n- `A` - selects the field in the toplevel record\n- `A.B` - selects the subfield B from field A\n- `A(foo)` - selects the map value denoted by key foo from the field A\n  in\n  the top level record.\n- `A[1]` - selects the 2nd entry in the array from field A in the top\n  level record\n- `A.B[2](hello).D` - A complex path! Selects field A, then subfield B,\n  which is an array. Takes the third entry in the array, which is a map,\n  and finds the value denoted by key hello. This in turn is another\n  record, so takes field D.\n\nIf a mapping does not resolve to a valid entry in the Avro record, null\nis returned.\n","created_at":"2016-02-08T21:03:15Z","updated_at":"2019-02-07T11:30:51Z","closed_at":"2019-02-07T11:30:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"360518e276bfaf1dc4fa7573bd594e5c499cf16e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":321808195,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjE4MDgxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2414/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2414/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2414/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/cec73fa6d9fbd238682f7f27c8788f028048ce49","head":{"label":"will-lauer:complexAvroStructures","ref":"complexAvroStructures","sha":"cec73fa6d9fbd238682f7f27c8788f028048ce49","user":{"login":"will-lauer","id":6795115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTUxMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6795115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer","html_url":"https://github.com/will-lauer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51321528,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTMyMTUyOA==","name":"druid","full_name":"will-lauer/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"will-lauer","id":6795115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTUxMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6795115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer","html_url":"https://github.com/will-lauer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-lauer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/will-lauer/druid","description":"Column

an orderby clause in a groupby query only supports the lexicographical ordering for dimensional columns. I think it would be useful to provide the alphanumeric ordering as well. \n\n`StringComparator` is a newly introduced class to abstract two types of ordering in characters. The main routines for them have been pulled from `AlphaNemericTopNMetircSpec` and `LexicographicalTopNMetricSpec`.\n\nThe below is a piece of grouby query which sorts the `page` dimension in descending alphanumeric order to give an example.\n\n```\n  \"limitSpec\" : {\"type\" : \"default\"\n    , \"limit\":5000\n    , \"columns\": [{\"dimension\":\"page\"\n                          , \"direction\":\"descending\"\n                          , \"dimensionOrder\" : \"alphanumeric\"}]\n  },\n```\n\nIt would be grateful if you post any comment here.
