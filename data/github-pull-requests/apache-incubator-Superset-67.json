When the user clicks the caret section of the button, they can now save the query as a dataset.\r\n\r\n`Bonus`: In order to create this button, I conveniently needed to fix the styling on the \"Run\" query split button. The split line now goes all the way through the button and the caret is centered.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### BEFORE:\r\n![saveButtonBefore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176063560-492b124a-40ce-4aaf-8745-691ddfa271ef.png)\r\n![runButtonBefore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176329868-20285ba0-16be-41ad-89fc-eb7dd6aba913.png)\r\n\r\n#### AFTER:\r\n![splitSaveButtonAfter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176063585-59e7074d-cec6-4bd3-b26e-276fd5a1a090.png)\r\n![saveButtonAfter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176063591-55dafb31-a843-4052-8372-a10bb9d0526a.png)\r\n![runButtonAfter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/176067479-c5ba02bc-834a-4d0b-8e01-3b1eb0787c65.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- From SqlLab, open a query for a database that has \"Allow this database to be explored\" enabled.\r\n  - Observe the new split save button\r\n    - Click the \"Save\" section of the button to see the save query modal\r\n    - Click the caret `v` section of the button, then click \"Save dataset\" to see the save dataset modal\r\n    - Both of these modals should be fully functional\r\n- From SqlLab, open a query for a database that does NOT have \"Allow this database to be explored\" enabled.\r\n  - Observe that the save button is a normal button, not split\r\n    - Clicking this button should show the save query modal\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR streamlines the process of creating a chart or changing a chart's visualization type by allowing the user to double-click a visualization type in the viz type gallery to automatically submit the form.  On the AddSlice page, this only works if the user has already selected a dataset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Visit `/chart/add`.\r\n2. Without selecting a dataset, double-click on a viz type.  Ensure that nothing happens other than that viz type being selected in the gallery.\r\n3. Select a dataset, then double-click on a different viz type.  Ensure that the form automatically submits, redirecting to Explore with the dataset and new viz type selected.\r\n4. On Explore, click \"View all charts\" in the \"Vizualization type\" control to open the \"Select a visualization type\" modal.\r\n5. Double-click on a new viz type and ensure that the modal disappears and the new viz type is active.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\n- Use our Select component as substitute of the Autocomplete one so options are loaded without the user having to trigger a search and also we are more consistent with the rest of the app\r\n- Changing `datasetId` to lowercase so when custom props get into the DOM we don't get warning related to invalid formatting\r\n- We extracted the dropdown out of the radio because it causes invalid click handling when an option is selected\r\n- Add getPopupContainer as prop for Select component\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

`ensure_user_is_set` method shares similar logic to `override_user`. It has logic to only override the user if not set—which I gather is to ensure that it doesn't permanently change the user, however if no user was previously set, setting of a user will persist.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the `override_user` logic to also include a `force` flag to only override if non-set enabling the `ensure_user_is_set` method to be removed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nYak shaving at its finest. Originally I drafted this PR to fix an issue with inconsistencies between ownership checks as described in [this](https://apache-superset.slack.com/archives/G013HAE6Y0K/p1655921947616779) Slack thread. BTW this PR does not address said issue—I _believe_ we only need a migration for legacy charts/datasets.\r\n\r\nThings quickly spiraled out of control as I realized that the DAO `check_access` method checks whether the actor is an owner alongside a check whether the current user is an admin—this clearly is wrong, i.e., both checks should be for the same user. Digging further I realize that the actor is _always_ `g.user` and thus continuing my crusade to simplify the whole user space (removing passing `g.user` all around the place) I opted to fully deprecate the actor concept—which touched a huge swatch of files. The main reason being is that Superset is really only configured to work with the logged in user and overrides should be done—if needed—via the `override_user` context manager.\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR of this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Removes the `actor` construct across all the DAO models.\r\n2. Refactors `check_ownership` which either raised or returned a `bool` into the `raise_for_owernship` and `is_owner` methods—the later being a wrapper of the former. This helps to improve code readability, i.e., it is apparent that `raise_for_owernship` raises. These methods have been moved to the security manager to allow for customization.\r\n3. Removes duplicate methods, i.e., whether a user is an admin or owner.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen a user saves a chart in Explore, the client sends one `POST /explore` request, then the server creates/updates the chart and optionally adds it to a new/existing dashboard as indicated.  This PR updates Explore's `SaveModal` to instead use v1 API endpoints to accomplish the same.  Here's the updated sequence of API calls:\r\n- If user is creating a new dashboard: `POST /api/v1/dashboard/`\r\n- If user is adding to a new dashboard: `PUT /api/v1/dashboard/{dashboard_id}`\r\n- If user is saving as a new chart: `POST /api/v1/chart/`\r\n  - If adding to new/existing dashboard: `{ dashboards: [..., dashboard_id] }`\r\n- If user is overwriting an existing chart: `PUT /api/v1/chart/{chart_id}`\r\n  - If adding to new/existing dashboard: `{ dashboards: [..., dashboardId] }`\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR makes the Save and Save and Go to Dashboard buttons no longer trigger a page refresh.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nTry performing the following tasks with and without proposed update and ensure that interface and user experience are identical (with the exception of there no longer being page refreshes):\r\n- Create new chart from scratch, save as new chart, don't add to dashboard\r\n- Create new chart from scratch, save as new chart, add to existing dashboard\r\n- Create new chart from scratch, save as new chart, add to new dashboard\r\n- Edit existing chart, overwrite existing chart, don't add to dashboard\r\n- Edit existing chart, overwrite existing chart, add to existing dashboard\r\n- Edit existing chart, overwrite existing chart, add to new dashboard\r\n- Edit existing chart, save as new chart, don't add to dashboard\r\n- Edit

PR in a slew of many to cleanup/standardize the user ID/username logic. Specifically it:\r\n\r\n1. Replaces the Flask-AppBuilder [User.get_id](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/090ddb4645992fb390da93906301c63b204db0df/flask_appbuilder/security/sqla/models.py#L160-L161) and Flask-Login [UserMixin.get_id](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login/blob/082badd924a678445795721d67f8f6bf3f29ad58/src/flask_login/mixins.py#L23-L27) calls which returns `Optional[str]` with a `get_user_id` convenience method  which returns `Optional[int]`. I'm not sure how problematic this was given I doubt authors know of this nuance and thus many Python `==` checks would have failed, i.e., `1 == \"1\"` evaluates to `False`, however the database filters may have been more lenient, i.e., in MySQL `SELECT 1 = '1'` evaluates to true.\r\n2. Fixes `get_owner` which returned the ID of the current user and not the referenced user.\r\n3. Additional cleanup.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn the big number chart, we currently use `computeMaxFontSize` to measure the font size, where the incoming width is the actual width of the chart. After testing, it is found that the calculated font size has a certain error, resulting in truncation in the dashboard. So here we decrease 8px of the width to display fonts of different text lengths well.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n|   | before | after |\r\n| - | ------ | ----- |\r\n|  6 length  |    <img width=\"243\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/175508434-d0246b42-2fec-45c1-a557-5a657ab6629e.png\">    |  <img width=\"313\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/175508325-70923b69-df1f-4eb6-adea-9c92184dfe0a.png\">     |\r\n|  7 length  |   <img width=\"242\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/175509584-c902d7d2-77be-44b4-ac2b-4e85d009a799.png\">     |    <img width=\"221\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/175509528-667fa374-9f99-4b9c-928c-7468ba5e1a0b.png\">   |\r\n|  ...  |  ...      |  ...     |\r\n| 12 length |  <img width=\"318\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/175509996-8af8523f-fda7-4835-9198-a645ab401320.png\">   |  <img width=\"219\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/175511478-889fcae6-d1c7-483a-ab44-31bd09c65abb.png\"> |\r\n\r\nSince the minimum font size is 10px, if the text length exceeds 12 in extreme cases, it will be truncated.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSplits the Synchronous and Asynchronous behaviour of the Select component into two separate components. It's very clear that the behaviors are different and we can significantly reduce code complexity if we treat them as different components. \r\n\r\nThis task was outlined as a part of this PR by @michael-s-molina : https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20143\r\n\r\nMost of the use cases for the select component are synchronous at the moment, so the default \"Select\" component will remain the synchronous Select. \"AsyncSelect\" is the new component for asynchronous use cases. For this PR, the files remain identical to ensure nothing will be broken, but references to the Select Component that have asynchronous options have been changed to reference AsyncSelect.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nMove spark engine spec in `hive.py` to a new file: `spark.py` and support Spark 3.x DateFormat; \r\n\r\n1. As tools like Kyuubi are gradually maturing, spark SQL has greater advantages than hive, and pyhive can not meet some of the features of spark SQL. I think it would be better to take spark SQL Engine spec alone; It is also convenient to provide better Kyuubi or spark server support in the future;\r\n2. Spark3.0 remove date format string[apache/superset/pull/18690], DatabricksEngineSpec have fixed it: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31892> but Spark SQL engine is not, so i simply fix it;\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51081799/174930155-050bbb37-8c1d-48cb-86f6-98e72d1036d3.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51081799/174935191-bcc9b55e-0678-4295-ab26-085beb9c3f98.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

up to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20351 where I added some extra checks and lookups for when a column lookup returned `None` on dual write. We're still seeing incidents of the same error: `psycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"sl_columns_uuid_key\"` intermittently and I was able to repro again in a test when adding in an additional query on the session for existing columns. It seems that the query is triggering an autoflush which is attempting to create a new column when one already exists. I added a `no-flush` flag onto any newColumn queries and also made sure to pull in the id of any existing columns when updating it and adding it to the session so that SqlAlchemy will treat it as an update instead of a write. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nMore unit tests, because we don't have a reliable way to repro this issue. But regression testing is necessary. Most issues are happening on import when the dataset already exists and is being overwritten, but for regression, thorough testing of editing and importing datasets that either do or do not exist would be needed.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nUse Superset to connect to a PostgreSQL database with a column of type `tstzrange`. Then, on \"SQL Lab\" -> \"SQL Editor\" try to query the database on data from the table that has the `tstzrange` column type.\r\n\r\nThe bug shows the error message stating it is unable to serialize the data. This PR creates a representation for that column type.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

quote:\r\n\r\n[@S Thelin](https://apache-superset.slack.com/team/U03LFFH7N1X)\r\n I don’t believe we can provide query stats given the way the Trino client is configured. Statistics are updated when fetch is called per [here](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client/blob/ca57138aa0cbeb337e4b032fefb1e88fe7d4a633/trino/client.py#L679-L683), however this also fetches results and we cannot advance the cursor in the handle_cursor method. There could be some trickery we could do, but I think it’s safer to simply fallback to the default method.\r\n \r\n @john-bodley

Retry when executing alert queries to avoid sending transient errors to users as alert failure notifications\r\n\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nDetails documented at https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20418\r\n\r\nWhen there are transient errors, alert owners will receive a notification saying the alert fails even though the underlying dataset is working properly. Adding retries to avoid users receiving redundant notifications.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThis only happens when there are transient errors, so there is no stable way to reproduce the issue. Added unit tests to make sure execute_query function is retried when it should.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIf we create a new chart and add it to the dashboard, then generating a permalink for that char from said dashboard does not highlight it on load.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that, for these charts, they're not part of the dashboard per-se, and get added at the end (in new rows).\r\nFor that reason, we're generating the id for them on the fly, and thus, they're always different on load.\r\nThe permalink does not find the chart in question in that case.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the id generation for these charts to always be the same.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. create a new chart and add to dashboard\r\n2. click 3 dot menu of the chart and copy permalink\r\n3. open chart permalink in browser and observe the chart\r\n\r\nEnsure that the chart highlights.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFor the alert and reports, the active toggle could lag and give the user the impression nothing is happening.\r\nThis PR just uses an optimistic update instead, and revert the change if the API fails.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is part of the Single Page App initiative and it adds the `/explore` endpoint to the `v1` API. The previous legacy endpoint in `superset.views.core` was responsible not only for assembling the Explore context but also to save Explore-related information. This endpoint, however, does not contain any save operation. We should use the existing `v1` endpoints to save the charts and dashboard relationships. Another important difference is that this endpoint does not return shared bootstrap data such as `user`, `permissions`, `common`, etc. as these are already available by other means.\r\n\r\nThe legacy endpoint also contained redirects and flash messages. These were transformed into HTTP response errors/values and should be handled by the client-side.\r\n\r\nMuch of the code in the new endpoint comes from the legacy one. It's important to mention that it is not the objective of the PR to refactor the code at this point to avoid introducing potential regressions. \r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /v1/explore/\r\n\r\nQUERY PARAMS # all optional\r\n   form_data_key=<key>\r\n   permalink_key=<key>\r\n   slice_id=<id>\r\n   dataset_id=<id>\r\n   dataset_type=<type> \r\n\r\nRESPONSE \r\n{ \r\n   form_data: <object>,\r\n   dataset: <object>,\r\n   slice: <object>,\r\n   message: <string> # information related to the request\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe will remove the legacy endpoint after the SPA initiative is completed.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, when we use a `Pie chart` on a high cardinality column as a dimension, the `Pie chart` will be crashed.\r\n\r\nNow we have a new [mechanism](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20010) to set `a new control value` for each control when the chart is switched.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, if the chart switch to the Pie and `row_limit` is greater than 100, the `row_limit` will be set to default value `100`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently cache warmup feature is unusable due to #9597 & #18933\r\nThis implement intend to fix it by following changes:\r\n- Use security_manager.find_user to find a user credential\r\n- Use WebDriverProxy to perform warmups\r\n  - In Superset, front-end tend to send multiple api with complex filter and many options, which is difficult to replay via simple request apis. In order to reduce the probability to cache the wrong slices or with wrong parameters, we use web driver to simulate a user's real behavior.\r\n- Refine WebDriverProxy to support multiple operations without re-initialize web driver\r\n- Cache toward dashboard instead of slices, because slices cache aren't always able to use in dashboards\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

MySQL for Superset's metadata database where the SQLAlchemy LargeBinary type—which is used for the `key_value.value` column—is encoded as a `BLOB` which can handle up to 64 KiB of data.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSwitching out all references of `ConnectorRegistry` to `DatasourceDAO`. In the PR, we are focusing on just removing the references and moving towards allowing other Datasources to power charts. \r\n\r\nOne issue is the circular dependencies that are blocking us from fully removing the logic to allow the app to run. So i've moved that code out the `ConnectorRegistry` for now and will prioritize a bigger refactor to stop the import issues in superset moving forward.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThere should be padding between rows in a dashboard.

When hovering over a filter, the selection box shows some space between the plots\r\n* When you move the charts into tabs, there is no space between plots any more (see first screenshot)\r\n* AFTER APPLYING CHANGES FROM PR:\r\n* Now there is also some space when the charts are within tabs (see second

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe RightMenu currently uses the `useQueryParam` hook that needs a Provider to wrap it (much like the redux store provider, theme provider, etc).\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have more that one entry point (App.tsx/js) and they don't have the same structure.\r\nLong term solution is to unify these into a single entry point, or at least, have the same provider structure for commonly used tools.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the useQueryParam in said component if the router is available, and otherwise ignores it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n--\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nEnsure that, adding a database from the + menu works.\r\nEnsure the explore loads correctly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nUsers can add Markdown to their Dashboards, which allow to include images using `<img src=\"$link\">`. However, if the Dashboard has an image added this way, the Download as image functionality will fail. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that, depending on where do we source the image from, we could run into CORS issues.\r\nThat, however, show not make the image generation fail.\r\n\r\nThe library that we use, `dom-to-image`, is pretty much deprecated and hasn't received updates for a long while.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the library for a fork that's been rewritten and well maintained: `dom-to-image-more`.\r\nThe library does not fail, and instead shows a placeholder if it can't fetch the image.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/173392024-12b0cfb4-a5a6-4067-9c8f-d3cb680bd219.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/173392092-46384421-d0cd-4331-a5b1-c156dd6b99c2.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Access your Workspace.\r\n2. Create a new Dashboard.\r\n3. Add a Markdown element to it.\r\n4. Add below code to your Markdown:\r\n```\r\n<img src=\"https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/39464018/58649580-eca4-11ea-844d-c2ddca24b226\">\r\n ```\r\n5. Save your changes.\r\n6. Click on the three ellipses > Download as image.\r\n\r\nEnsure the dashboard image is generated.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, for the conditional color scaling, alpha is directly proportional to the value. This PR adds a checkbox to the Conditional Formatting modal that allows the designer to invert this scale, ie, as the value increases, the alpha _decreases_\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this fixes an issue I noticed with #20016 that broke the conditional formatting feature (need to convert hex string to 'rgb(R,G,B)' string).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBroken color formatting:\r\n![broken](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70416691/173202836-c3465070-1a93-4562-88b4-86b73ac7642b.png)\r\n\r\nRegular conditional
