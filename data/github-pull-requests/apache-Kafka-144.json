commits for KIP-145 (KAFKA-5142) changed how the Connect workers instantiate and configure the Converters, and also added the ability to do the same for the new HeaderConverters. However, the last few commits removed the default value for the `converter.type` property for Converters and HeaderConverters, and this broke how the internal converters were being created.\r\n\r\nThis change corrects the behavior so that the `converter.type` property is always set by the worker (or by the Plugins class), which means the existing Converter implementations will not have to do this. The built-in JsonConverter, ByteArrayConverter, and StringConverter also implement HeaderConverter which implements Configurable, but the Worker and Plugins methods do not yet use the `Configurable.configure(Map)` method and instead still use the `Converter.configure(Map,boolean)`.\r\n\r\nSeveral tests were modified, and a new PluginsTest was added to verify the new behavior in Plugins for instantiating and configuring the Converter and HeaderConverter instances.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

`ChangeLoggingKeyValueBytesStore` used to write null to its underlying store instead of propagating the delete, which has two drawbacks:\r\n- an iterator will see null values\r\n- unbounded memory growth of the underlying in-memory keyvalue store\r\n\r\nThe fix will just propagate the delete instead of performing put(key, null). \r\n\r\nThe changes to the tests:\r\n- extra test whether the key is really gone after delete by calling the `approximateEntries` on the underlying store. This number is exact because we know the underlying store in the test is of type `InMemoryKeyValueStore`\r\n- extra test to check a delete is logged as <key, null>  (the existing test would also succeed if the key is just absent)\r\n\r\nWhile also updating the corresponding tests of the `ChangeLoggingKeyValueStore` I noticed the class is nowhere used anymore so I removed it from the source code for clarity.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-31T13:29:19Z","updated_at":"2018-02-02T08:19:40Z","closed_at":"2018-02-02T00:14:23Z","merged_at":"2018-02-02T00:14:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0132c31e91bb090ff012c726ac4ed92566ce7fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4495/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4495/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4495/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/71496aa78375068d5d171ccf12fb0e32167b98ad","head":{"label":"bartdevylder:nonnulls","ref":"nonnulls","sha":"71496aa78375068d5d171ccf12fb0e32167b98ad","user":{"login":"bartdevylder","id":1268215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjgyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder","html_url":"https://github.com/bartdevylder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":106297543,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDYyOTc1NDM=","name":"kafka","full_name":"bartdevylder/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bartdevylder","id":1268215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjgyMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder","html_url":"https://github.com/bartdevylder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bartdevylder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bartdevylder/kafka","description":"Mirror

KStream-GlobalKTable joins let `null` `KeyValueMapper` results indicate no match\r\n\r\nFor KStream-GlobalKTable joins, a `KeyValueMapper` is used to derive a key from the stream records into the `GlobalKTable`. For some stream values there may be no valid reference to the table stream. This patch allows developers to use `null` return values to indicate there is no possible match. This is possible in this case since `null` is never a valid key value for a `GlobalKTable`.\r\nWithout this patch, providing a `null` value caused the stream to crash on Kafka 1.0.\r\n\r\nI added unit tests for KStream-GlobalKTable left and inner joins, since they were missing. I also covered this additional scenario where `KeyValueMapper` returns `null` to insure it is handled correctly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

patch adds support for lazy down-conversion of records for older clients. Effectively, it moves down-conversion out of the handler threads and into the network threads. This should improve memory usage since responses that have only been queued for sending will not occupy the memory needed to hold the converted records.\r\n\r\nThis is largely a refactor which is covered through existing unit and integration tests. I have also added unit tests for the new `LazyDownConvertingRecords` implementation.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

PR aims to optimize topology by eliminating state stores that are directly piped to a sink topic. \r\nThere few things to note:\r\n\r\n- If topology sink operator is `toStream`, then we consider the operator just before `toStream` and check if it has state store.\r\n\r\n- Just removing the state store from `storeToChangelogTopic` can cause a problem in case of failure, especially with `EoS`. So, what we propose here is that if the sink operator contains state store, then i) we remove selected state stores from `storeToChangelogTopic` and put it into `stateStoreToChangelogTopicOnlyForRestoring`.  The first step will make sure that selected state stores will not `write` to changelog topic. The second step is only needed when the state store `reads` from changelog topic (say, in case of failure).","created_at":"2018-01-20T16:33:42Z","updated_at":"2022-12-29T00:22:35Z","closed_at":"2022-12-29T00:22:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a25c92e0d6b9787d5f326da2c3508329fe975543","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ef28b5b21e3ad90f2ef2442d7765472dc673db99","head":{"label":"jeyhunkarimov:pipe_to_sink","ref":"pipe_to_sink","sha":"ef28b5b21e3ad90f2ef2442d7765472dc673db99","user":{"login":"jeyhunkarimov","id":5923880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5923880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov","html_url":"https://github.com/jeyhunkarimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62637422,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjYzNzQyMg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"jeyhunkarimov/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jeyhunkarimov","id":5923880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5923880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov","html_url":"https://github.com/jeyhunkarimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jeyhunkarimov/kafka","description":"Mirror

is a proof of concept of some ideas for making a public Kafka cluster testing interface.  The main idea here is that you have a public, stable interface where you can easily spin up a Kafka cluster for testing with code like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry (MiniKafkaCluster cluster = new MiniKafkaClusterBuilder()\r\n    .addZookeeperNode(new MiniZookeeperNodeBuilder())\r\n    .addNode(new MiniKafkaNodeBuilder())\r\n    .build()) {\r\n  // do stuff with the brokers, zookeepers, etc.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the MiniKafkaCluster extends AutoCloseable, it can be used in a Java7 try-with-resources block.  It will be automatically closed when it goes out of scope.\r\n\r\nBecause we use builders everywhere, it is possible to easily add new parameters to any of the classes without breaking backwards compatibility.  For example, we could add a way to configure the port or address that each Kafka node binds to when it starts up, and so forth.\r\n\r\nWhen parameters are not supplied, they should default to something reasonable.  For example, if no Kafka log directories are specified, we create a single Kafka log directory for each broker.  When broker ids are not specified, we default to automatic ID assignment through ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\nTests can shut down brokers or zookepeer nodes as part of the test by invoking `shutdown` on the relevant Java object. They services can be restarted by calling `start`.\r\n\r\nDuring cluster startup and shutdown, we parallelize operations that take a long time, like starting a broker or shutting down a broker.  This cuts test times.\r\n\r\nThis is a rough sketch that doesn't include clients or SSL / SASL.","created_at":"2018-01-18T22:43:26Z","updated_at":"2023-06-26T18:00:36Z","closed_at":"2023-06-26T18:00:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b3cd990bc7baadc52333cbfb2c1944059dcfcdf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/6d02ae1de59ca4b9958a839576f765371d090076","head":{"label":"cmccabe:testkit","ref":"testkit","sha":"6d02ae1de59ca4b9958a839576f765371d090076","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror
