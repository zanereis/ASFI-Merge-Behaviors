(initial version)</li>\n<li>Multiple bugfixes</li>\n<li>The default build toolchains have been updated to pass <code>IntermediateOutputPath</code>, <code>OutputPath</code>, and <code>OutDir</code> properties to the <code>dotnet build</code> command. This change forces all build outputs to be placed in a new directory generated by BenchmarkDotNet, and fixes many issues that have been reported with builds. You can also access these paths in your own <code>.csproj</code> and <code>.props</code> from those properties if you need to copy custom files to the output.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed multiple build-related bugs including passing MsBuildArguments and .Net 8's <code>UseArtifactsOutput</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>DotNetCliBuilder</code> removed <code>retryFailedBuildWithNoDeps</code> constructor option.</li>\n<li><code>DotNetCliCommand</code> removed <code>RetryFailedBuildWithNoDeps</code> property and <code>BuildNoRestoreNoDependencies()</code> and <code>PublishNoBuildAndNoRestore()</code> methods (replaced with <code>PublishNoRestore()</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/cf882d378d51a6998aad43ca9caa29c19d122b87\"><code>cf882d3</code></a> Add macOS Sequoia in OsBrandStringHelper</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/17cf3b0a71b7fa41e83e2db16307219420f4a4f8\"><code>17cf3b0</code></a> [docs] Prepare v0.14.0 changelog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/b3fbe7c489c2b6e354f736ba4c0854e4f1daacfb\"><code>b3fbe7c</code></a> Set next BenchmarkDotNet version: 0.14.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/23e6c523cfe638d53508d6ca8212ca23501049ce\"><code>23e6c52</code></a> Fix InvalidOperationException in DotMemoryDiagnoser</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/3d34edb219b84a68a377cb38b833dd30241fd5c8\"><code>3d34edb</code></a> Bump JetBrains.Profiler.SelfApi: 2.5.2-&gt;2.5.9</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/bf0a49d1f5756cd2f7cb1da56974a7ee6a5a6fdf\"><code>bf0a49d</code></a> fix(CI): Deprecation issues (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/2605\">#2605</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/0275649d350bcdc6953215598eca775b4882ece5\"><code>0275649</code></a> ﻿Fixed crash from TaskbarProgress when BuiltInComInteropSupport is disabled. ...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/15200d46a1395ef6e69c39c6f3371ab0e0d96e5c\"><code>15200d4</code></a> [build] Add BenchmarkDotNet.Exporters.Plotting.Tests to unit-tests</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/834417a7dbec1dbb22a99cbb5f45c9cd474e483e\"><code>834417a</code></a> Improve logging in ScottPlotExporterTests</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/commit/f8082a2138b7cf1bda1eab8dca98d7d3c43b9946\"><code>f8082a2</code></a> Fix IntroSummaryStyle compilation</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/compare/v0.13.12...v0.14.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=BenchmarkDotNet&package-manager=nuget&previous-version=0.13.12&new-version=0.14.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

performance numbers to compare the current master-http branch against 3.7-dev using ProfilingApplication.\r\n\r\n## ProfilingApplication Information\r\n\r\nThe **ProfilingApplication** has two modes: latency and throughput.\r\n\r\nThe latency test will run a particular query one at a time for several runs. It then reports the average latency of the query. The chosen query for this test was `g.V().both().repeat()` as the server is able to quickly respond to this request but it also generates a lot of data to be returned over the wire.\r\n\r\nThe throughput test will issue *requests (an application argument)* number of queries to the server and see how long it takes to complete them. It will then report the results as number or queries completed per second. The throughput tests can be either **exercise** or **1+1**. When the application argument *exercise* is set to true, there are a number of preset queries that will be used, if it is false, then \"1+1\" is the query used. See https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/gremlin-driver/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/driver/util/ProfilingApplication.java#L54 for the list of queries\r\n\r\n## Performance
