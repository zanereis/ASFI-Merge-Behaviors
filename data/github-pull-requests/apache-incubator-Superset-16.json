It also adds the chart migration logic (legacy ‚û°Ô∏è ECharts). Users can execute this migration using the [CLI command](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25304) and disable the legacy version with the [VIZ_TYPE_DENYLIST](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/ec6191023263ac5f8292dd37f037805c3196e029/superset/config.py#L829) configuration.\r\n\r\nI added the minimum required controls to allow the migration but many more controls can be added in the future to improve the chart's customizability.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1086\" alt=\"Screenshot

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdds a function to check if a string is HTML and not capable of JSON parsing to ensure the client does not show raw HTML where there should be an error message.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Change the return of the `ChartDataRestApi` response for a `POST` method to be an error with the `message` `kwarg ` containing raw html in string form. e.g. `self.response_500(message='<html><div>Error</div></html>')`\r\n2. Load a dashboard, and click `See more` on the unexpected error alert produced by charts.\r\n3. The message displayed should be `Server error` or, in the case of a detected 404, `Not found`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nThe existing documentation has the user download the latest release of Chrome and use ChromeDriver v102.  This combination doesn't function, providing the user with an error saying the Chrome version is unsupported from ChromeDriver during alert/report generation.\r\n\r\nThis update pulls both the version of Chrome and ChromeDriver from the Chrome Labs repository which is centrally maintained and allows for both the Chrome and ChromeDriver version to stay in lock step.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the Superset base image version and Chrome versions can be set as build-args during image creation.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Build the container as per `docs/docs/configuration/alerts-reports.mdx` with a customised tag\r\n1. Update `x-superset-image` in `docker-compose.yml` to point to your customised tag\r\n1. Start the stack, configure SMTP, create then fire a report\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhile installing `superset` on RedHat I got a bunch of `Permission denied`. Looking a bit around (e.g. [1](https://prefetch.net/blog/2017/09/30/using-docker-volumes-on-selinux-enabled-servers/), [2](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/container-permission-denied-errors), or [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60680394/docker-compose-using-with-selinux)), it seems it is a known issue between `docker-compose` and SELinux. The suggested solution (add `:z`) worked for me.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR refactors the distributed lock tests in the following way:\r\n1. Replace assertions of mocked internals with assertions of the functional aspects of the lock\r\n2. Assert that the lock state is committed to the metastore during the locking process\r\n\r\nThis will make it safer to refactor SQLAlchemy session logic in accordance with [SIP-99A](#25107), as the test will ensure that commits happen at the critical moments (lock is taken, lock is released). In addition, it makes the test immune to refactoring of internals of the lock.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, when you have caching enabled and you click \"refresh dashboard\" it only updates the charts but not the filters. This is despite the filters having a loading spinner next to them.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Setup Superset with caching\r\n2. Create a dataset with a simple table and create any chart and add it to a dashboard. Add a filter to the dashboard - could be the values of one of the columns. Insert a new row to the table with a new value for the column you have created a filter for.\r\n3. Force refresh the dashboard using \"refresh dashboard\" in the upper right hand corner. \r\n\r\nYou will see your chart updating, but not the filter. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- [x]

For examples, to only show \"admin\" or users starting with the letter \"b\" in\r\n# the \"Owners\" dropdowns, you could add the following in your config:\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample `superset_config.py` with EXTRA_RELATED_QUERY_FILTERS configured to hide all users:\r\n```\r\n# Hide all users\r\ndef user_filter(query):\r\n    from sqlalchemy.sql import false\r\n    return query.filter(false())\r\n\r\nEXTRA_RELATED_QUERY_FILTERS = {\r\n    \"user\": user_filter,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:  \r\n<img width=\"217\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/61765/1cfb06a8-faaf-4c81-b013-777092ef2721\">\r\n\r\nAfter:  \r\n<img width=\"233\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/61765/b6ee4039-cbd0-46a4-89bd-0ed52ccee9e3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nIn the key value commands, we are often returning the keys from newly generated ORM objects, which are persisted in the `key_value` table. As we're currently using `commit()` to persist the objects prior to reading the keys, the session is reset, requiring a new session for fetching the keys. This can cause issues when distributing metastore reads to read replicas, as the data may sometimes not be available, causing an `ObjectDeletedError` exception during `CreateKeyValueCommand.run()`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.orm.exc.ObjectDeletedError: Instance '<KeyValueEntry at 0x7fe508293280>' has been deleted, or its row is otherwise not present.\r\n```\r\n\r\nA simple fix is to use `flush()`, which will ensure the same session is used, as stated in [SIP-99A](#25107):\r\n\r\n> It is worth noting that objects within the session, in either pending* or persisted state, can be queried albeit not having been committed to the database. We have a tendency to over commit (be that in the code or tests) resulting in fractured/partial atomic units. Typically working with objects in a persisted state is sufficient.\r\n\r\nAs we're now proposing to replace `commit()` with `flush()` in the key value commands, the session will need to be explicitly committed once the full unit of work is done. For example, for the create/upsert commands, we will now only commit after the last task finishes, ensuring atomicity:\r\n1. delete expired entries\r\n2. insert new entry\r\n3. commit\r\n\r\nHowever, there are instances where we explicitly need commits to happen during a single request lifecycle. For instance, the Key Value Distributed Lock needs to commit the lock to the metastore so other workers can observe it for the duration of the lock event. The same applies to the Metastore cache, where every set/add/delete operation should commit to the cache. For this reason we're adding explicit `commit()` calls both in the Metastore Cache and Lock context manager to ensure the values are persisted in the db during execution flow.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

environment configuration setting hook allows administrators to alter different database connection parameters on the fly based on user information and hook strategy. This can be use for a variety of purposes:\r\n\r\n- rewire a subset of users to use different database user accountsÔºåfor example, integrating with ldap\r\n- pass user related information to the database for logging or QoS purposes\r\n- custom, per-database-engine, environment-specific impersonation\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nPlease write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n     \r\nAlthough there is already a DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR hook available to inject database connection logic on the fly, if we do not modify the code in superset/models/core.py within the Database.get_sqla_engine method, this injection will affect all data source connections. Specifically, if different data sources require different injection logic, then we need to make different modifications to the code within superset/models/core.py to handle the different database types. Therefore, I have added a DB_CONNECTION_MODIFIER hook (clearly, DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR would be a better name, but it is already in use, so I used a synonym instead), which allows for different data sources to implement different injection logic on the fly, as long as these database injection logic classes implement the run method of the ImpalaURLModifier class. This increases the flexibility of injecting database connection logic on the fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe current DB selection empty state screen is modified through the setEmptyState function. As a result, when tabs switch and share the same DB selection ID, the setEmptyState call is ignored, leading to a bug where the empty state is displayed even when a DB is selected.\r\n\r\nThis commit unifies the state management by using useMemo to ensure that the showEmpty value is always set when there is a currently selected DB.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

can be mitigated in the following ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the\n[<code>--max-http-header-size=size</code>][] and/or the [<code>maxHeaderSize</code>][] options so\nthat no more headers than the <code>server.maxHeadersCount</code> limit can be sent.</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\n\nCurrently, we trigger the bulk of our CI on all PRs, and on push to the `master` and release branches.\n\nRelease branches currently are defined as `[0-9].[0-9]` meaning it will work for `3.5` and `10.10`, but not for `3.1.1`, `3.0-beta2` or whatever other release branch that don't fit the \"minor\" release pattern.\n\nNot I'm extending this to `[0-9].[0-9]*`. As a glob that mean it'll run for practically anything that loosely looks like a release branch.\n\nThe goal is to make it easier for people working in forks, whether private or public to trigger CI while doing their own release management. Currently if you want to trigger CI, you pretty much to either open a dummy PR, or push to a branch that fits the current pattern, which doesn't allow for flexibility around branch naming, which is

SUMMARY\r\nA dashboard can have an image attached in the markdown component that is hosted on a server that does not have proper CORS settings. Due to limitations of html2canvas, both PDF and image download will fail.\r\n\r\nFor reference from html2canvas:\r\n> All the images that the script uses need to reside under the [same origin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy) for it to be able to read them without the assistance of a [proxy](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/proxy/). Similarly, if you have other canvas elements on the page, which have been tainted with cross-origin content, they will become dirty and no longer readable by html2canvas. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the necessary frontend changes to defer the generation of the screenshot to a newly built endpoint. See https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/29187\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSee[SIP](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/29263)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new Notification `SlackV2Notification` that uses the Slack upload files v1 method. It is required for slack workspace owners to add the `channels:read` scope to their workspace in order to use this api. It also fetches all slack channels in order to convert user-inputed names to api-required ids. Because of this, I added a UI to support this. \r\n\r\nPer the SIP, the both the api and UI will attempt to convert the notification to SlackV2 if the scopes are in place. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nAfter: \r\n\r\nWith feature flag on:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5186919/64e0b816-fe6a-4bb3-b882-ecd08949eb21\r\n\r\nWith feature flag off (after it has been turned on once, so the existing v2 slack reports do not convert back to v1):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/5186919/1f04fa0a-bd15-4fc5-bfc2-85ef0a38be24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes a number of problems with the Custom SQL filter control:\r\n- There was a layout flick when changing the clause type\r\n- The algorithm that detects if something changes was not considering the filter clause. This was blocking users from changing only the filter clause (not the SQL) and saving the filter.\r\n- There were invalid values for the clause select which was leading to wrong behavior. The `Where` clause was actually being applied as `HAVING`. This bug was introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26875.\r\n\r\nThis PR also reimplements the tests using RTL and creates a helper function to interact with the `Select` component in tests.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Postgres database, a generic database error occurred. When fetching schemas via catalogs, restricted schemas triggered an error, causing the error to propagate to the UI, even though the database connection was correctly stored.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a soft fail for the above scenario, preventing the error from propagating to the UI.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a Postgres database connection using. a SQLAlchemy URI\r\n2. The connection should be created successfully with no errors\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

execution/parsing logic is a real rabbit warren‚Äîso many methods and diversions to execute SQL.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27725 _attempted_ to remove stripping comments when executing queries in SQL Lab, however it likely wasn't suffice. https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28363 (which also preventing stripping of comments in Explore) remedied this, however it was later reverted in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28567.\r\n\r\nThe original issue with https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27725 is it seems like the SQL is pre-processed/rendered in the command prior to the typical SQL Lab execution logic via Celery et al. This PR simply ensures that comments are never stripped within the context of SQL Lab. This change shouldn't cause the issue surfaced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28567.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.

SUMMARY\r\n- The CrateDB SQLAlchemy dialect needs more love, so it was separated from the DBAPI HTTP driver.\r\n- This patch concludes the update to the new designated CrateDB SQLAlchemy dialect package, [`sqlalchemy-cratedb`](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-cratedb/), which has been validated on a few other downstream packages already.\r\n- The patch also updates the documentation section about configuring the CrateDB connector driver ([preview](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/aef7f2dd1ff8853642eda2fdd3e5bbae4277f142/docs/docs/configuration/databases.mdx#cratedb)).\r\n\r\n### Personal Message\r\nDear Superset maintainers, first things first: Thanks a stack for conceiving and maintaining Apache Superset, you know who you are. Hereby, we are submitting a little update about the database adapter of CrateDB. With kind regards, Andreas.\r\n\r\nMay we ask you to approve running the software tests on this draft PR, so we can get an impression if anything breaks?\r\n\r\n\r\n/cc @hammerhead, @hlcianfagna,

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds the ability to control the `ALERT_MINIMUM_INTERVAL` and/or `REPORT_MINIMUM_INTERVAL` configs dynamically (rather than having it statically defined during runtime). This is useful in case the value should be dynamically changed/evaluated on demand (you might want to control it externally).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nAdded unit tests to make sure the config supports both an `integer` and a `callable`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing up #24539 \r\nThis commit modifies the `removeQueryEditor` function to asynchronously handle the process of deleting a queryEditor in localStorage in the same way as in non-persistent mode and periodically post deleted items to persistence via AutoSync's `deleteSqlEditor`.\r\n\r\nThis commit made the following changes:\r\n- In persistence mode, deleting a tab will no longer block the removal until it is fetched. Instead, the tab will be immediately discarded and stored the deleted ids in the local storage. (`destroyedQueryEditors`)\r\n- `removeQueryEditor` has been modified to always update to localStorage in the same way as in non-persistence mode\r\n- EditorAutoSync will execute `deleteSqlEditor` periodically and then remove the completed item from `destroyedQueryEditors` on success\r\n- Add the logic of storing localStorage `destroyedQueryEditors` for persistence mode \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nA rare bug has occurred in SQL Lab where queries from the previous state are being executed.\r\nThis bug happens because SQL Lab no longer unmounts the ace editor when tabs are changed.\r\nAs a result, the state before the tab change is hoisted in the editor's shortcut callback function, causing it to request the previous state's query.\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses the issue by ensuring that the latest query state from Redux is always passed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/1f117531-7f0e-4972-a7c4-e40bfc5e038e\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/447aa194-3e5a-41dd-ba91-ac42d36d7bb8\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nGo to SQL Lab and then open a new tab from the existing tab\r\nSelect a different database option from the previous cloned option\r\nType any sql in the editor and then hit run\r\nSwitch to the previous tab and then make a selection in the sql editor\r\nSwitch back to the new tab and then click the sql editor to focus in the editor and then hit \"Ctrl + Enter\" to run query via shortcut\r\nPlease check the query run with the editor's state (not the default sql, SELECT ...)\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a follow up for https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/29117, since it was confirmed on [this comment](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26654#issuecomment-2162050230) that the issue still persists.\r\n\r\nI'm updating these relationships to `viewonly=True`, since there's already an `after_delete` hook in place to delete tag association after an asset is deleted - [reference](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/tags/models.py#L276-L290). With that in mind, handling the cascade deletion in the relationship is redundant.\r\n\r\nLong-term, we could delete this hook and fix the relationships for a proper cascading deletion -- I'll look into that in a following PR (need to make sure that removing this hook won't impact any other logic in the application).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Make sure you have a dashboard and a chart with the same ID.\r\n2. Assign a tag for both assets. Also add owners to both assets.\r\n3. Validate that you're able to delete one of the assets.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-12T15:43:35Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:38:04Z","closed_at":"2024-06-12T16:39:35Z","merged_at":"2024-06-12T16:39:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"5167d20f2771e72e51bc4fd9dcb89988f32916cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2819983330,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODE5OTgzMzMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/dashboard","name":"dashboard","color":"3CC4E6","default":false,"description":"Namespace

it's better to `raise AnotherException() from ex` (using  `from`), so I'm fixing and enforcing this as well.\r\n\r\nI found this while debugging and dealing with incomplete stack traces, and thought

functionality to allow Trino to upload data via a CSV which previously resided as custom logic at Airbnb. This is based on the logic outlined in the `HiveEngineSpec`.\r\n\r\nNote I'm not certain whether this is best housed in the `TrinoEngineSpec` or `PrestoBaseEngineSpec`. Airbnb currently only supports Trino and thus I wouldn't be able to provide end-to-end testing for Presto.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

response list returns unnecessary data - css, position_json, and json_metadata. This fields data is large, and loads the network, but it is not used at the frontend, because they are not needed to display the dashboards list.\r\n\r\nIn my company, there was a problem with this, because our dashboards are large, and getting list of dashboards was taking 2-3 seconds. As soon as we deleted the return of these fields, it began to load instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n## Before\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/66589759/d85f9fd7-e9b8-4170-9626-aa93ca19a7c9)\r\n\r\n## After\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/66589759/68c8c767-fa77-42db-86f3-38ea64500784)\r\n\r\nLook at the Content Length\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nIn Mixed Series chart, when user sets \"Stack\" option to true for both queries, the series of the second query are stacked on top of the series of the first query. The reason for that is that both queries could have the same stack ids.\r\nThis PR introduces `stackIdSuffix`, which adds `_a` and `_b` suffixes to stack ids of queries A and B to ensure that they're unique.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nIn the screenshots - the bars represent the second query. Before, they were stacked on top of the series from 1st query.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1727\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/bc273c4d-89f4-4142-b8d0-14db324f27a0\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1725\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/e2e649e2-43fe-464e-9dff-064aa5f874a4\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create Mixed Series chart\r\n2. Set Stack to true for both queries\r\n3.

SUMMARY\r\nThe relationship between the `tagged_objects` table and the asset table (for example, `dashboard`) is a combination of the `object_id` and `object_type`. While this relationship works properly when displaying tags/etc, when deleting an asset SQLAlchemy was trying to run `DELETE FROM tagged_object WHERE tagged_object.tag_id = ? AND tagged_object.object_id = ?` which would delete more rows then it should (it's missing another filter for `object_type`), causing the operation to fail with an error: \r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.orm.exc.StaleDataError: DELETE statement on table 'tagged_object' expected to delete 3 row(s); Only 10 were matched.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `passive_deletes=True` argument to the `relationship`, so that the cascade delete is handled by the DB (based on the constraints).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Make sure you have a dashboard and a chart with the same ID.\r\n2. Assign a tag for both assets. Also add `owners` to both assets.\r\n3. Validate that you're able to delete one of the assets.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue: \r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe're planning to introduce OAuth2 client management to Superset, so the clients can be configured on the app, and assigned to multiple databases.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a first step in that direction, allowing client configuration to be stored in a the database `encrypted_extra` parameter. This allows us to add support for OAuth2 to more DB engine specs before starting the work on a full UI solution.\r\n\r\nIn addition to reading the client configuration from `encrypted_extra` this PR also refactors the logic for triggering OAuth2, introducing a new method called `needs_oauth2` to the DB engine spec. This is needed to give more flexibility to account for different OAuth2 providers.\r\n\r\nThe PR also introduces a new trigger for OAuth2, when the `raw_connection` fails due to needing a personal user token.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing up #24539 \r\nThis commit modifies the `setActiveQueryEditor` function to asynchronously handle the process of switching active a queryEditor in localStorage in the same way as in non-persistent mode and periodically post active state to persistence via AutoSync's `updateCurrentSqlEditor`.\r\n\r\nThis commit made the following changes:\r\n- Modified the process to remove the step of switching the activeQueryEditor based on the persistent mode in `switchQueryEditor`, and instead changed it to fetchQueryEditor to clearly fetch the persistent queryEditor record from the api\r\n- In persistence mode, changing the active tab will no longer block the query editor data until it is fetched. Instead, the tab will change and a loading state will be displayed [see the following screenshots]\r\n- `setActiveQueryEditor` has been modified to always apply to localStorage in the same way as in non-persistence mode\r\n- EditorAutoSync will execute `updateCurrentSqlEditor` periodically and then set `lastUpdatedActiveTab` on success\r\n- Add the logic of storing localStorage tabHistory for persistence mode \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n**In a state of network

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nImplements a new feature enabling a tab to be selected as a view for an alert/report. When a dashboard is selected as the content for a report, an antd TreeSelect component is rendered to load and select tab options. When selected, the tab selection is added to the report payload as an anchor.\r\n\r\nOn execution, the feature takes advantage of existing logic for the report.extra.dashboard.anchor_tab attribute of the ReportSchedule SQLA model. When extra metadata are attached to the report schedule, a permalink is generated with the metadata included, and this permalink is then used to generate screenshots of the selected dashboard.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/e075b22bd5574e30bcf3bbec5984884f?sid=aeefd476-bf0a-4289-b13f-6b5fe2854156\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nCreate a tab or tabs within an existing dashboard\r\nNavigate to the alerts and reports listview from the settings menu\r\nCreate a new report\r\nUnder the content section select the dashboard\r\nA selection field for tabs should appear with the tabs available within the select options\r\nselect a tab and save the report with the

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21163 where‚Äîif enabled‚Äîthe generic x-axis is incorrectly included in the pre-query (for engines which don‚Äôt support JOINs or subqueries) when determining the top-n series.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the top-n series are determined for the entire period, i.e., sans the x-axis as a dimension, however within the confines of the generic x-axis said axis is included as a column. This resulted in an explosion of records‚Äîvia (x, y) pairs‚Äîmeaning the top-n typically would just be the top-1. The fix is merely to exclude said column when determining the top-n series.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI and tested locally. Sadly writing unit/integration tests for said logic is non-trivial given i) the scale of the `get_sqla_query ` function (which is ~ 700 lines of code), and ii) the lack of associated tests.\r\n\r\n###

is picking up the bill for Cypress.io and it's getting pricey for the usage we have for it. In this PR, I'm moving normal pull_request and push events to run in local GHA mode without the `--record` flag. This means we can't use the `--parallel` feature, but I wrote a little python script that segments the jobs and make them run in parallel.\r\n\r\nI'm also providing a `workflow_dispatch` option where you can trigger a cypress.io run in dashboard mode, so you can still go use their stuff on a given branch if/where needed.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThere's a discrepancy between our backend configuration and frontend implementation for GUEST_TOKEN_HEADER_NAME.\r\n\r\nWe allow customization of GUEST_TOKEN_HEADER_NAME in the backend configuration.\r\nHowever, this configuration is not being passed to the frontend.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the ability to customize the header name in the frontend is currently not functional.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/bc9eab9902a11543e138005ff1d0ac36e63265ef/superset-frontend/src/embedded/index.tsx#L153-L159\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/bc9eab9902a11543e138005ff1d0ac36e63265ef/superset/embedded/view.py#L79-L85\r\n\r\n###

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28704 we removed `sl_tables` however, in the downgrade path there are dependencies on other `sl_tables` that cause the downgrade to fail. \r\n\r\n`sl_datasets`

`sl_dataset_columns`\r\n\r\nso the new creation order is\r\n`sl_datasets`\r\n`sl_tables`\r\n`sl_dataset_columns`\r\n`sl_dataset_users`\r\n`sl_dataset_tables`\r\n`sl_table_columns`\r\n`sl_dataset_columns`\r\n\r\nAlso normalized cases when creating columns
