What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBack port of #22789 and #23617 to branch-2.3\r\n\r\nWhen a user passes a Stream to groupBy, ```CodegenSupport.consume``` ends up lazily generating ```inputVars``` from a Stream, since the field ```output``` will be a Stream. At the time ```output.zipWithIndex.map``` is called, conditions are correct. However, by the time the map operation actually executes, conditions are no longer appropriate. The closure used by the map operation ends up using a reference to the partially created ```inputVars```. As a result, a StackOverflowError occurs.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that ```inputVars``` is eagerly created while conditions are appropriate. It seems this was also an issue with the code path for creating ```inputVars``` from ```outputVars``` (SPARK-25767). I simply extended the solution for that code path to encompass both code paths.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSQL unit tests\r\nnew test\r\npython

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Replacing `java.util.Calendar` in  `DateTimeUtils. truncTimestamp` and in `DateTimeUtils.getOffsetFromLocalMillis ` by equivalent code using Java 8 API for timestamp manipulations. The reason is `java.util.Calendar` is based on the hybrid calendar (Julian+Gregorian) but *java.time* classes use Proleptic Gregorian calendar which assumes by SQL standard.\r\n-  Replacing `Calendar.getInstance()` in `DateTimeUtilsSuite` by similar code in `DateTimeTestUtils` using *java.time* classes\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested by existing suites: `DateExpressionsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite` and `DateTimeUtilsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-24T20:36:12Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:36:36Z","closed_at":"2019-01-28T16:52:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20d32b02f9e7e248e274deeafa84f328c6e6def1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23641/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23641/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23641/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a984e48907ef873414d5182e9485cd17d28ae02c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:cleanup-date-time-utils","ref":"cleanup-date-time-utils","sha":"a984e48907ef873414d5182e9485cd17d28ae02c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdates the attempt ID used by FileFormatWriter. Tasks in stage attempts use the same task attempt number and could conflict. Using Spark's task attempt ID guarantees that Hadoop TaskAttemptID instances are unique.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of d5a97c1 to the 2.3 branch.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. Also validated that we no longer detect this failure case in our logs after

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Remove parameter `isReadPath`. The supported types of read/write should be the same. \r\n\r\n2. Disallow reading `NullType` for ORC data source. In #21667 and #21389, it was supposed that ORC supports reading `NullType`, but can't write it. This doesn't make sense. I read docs and did some tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen reading from empty tables, the optimization `OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuery` may return wrong results:\r\n```\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE t (col1 INT, p1 INT) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (p1)\")\r\nsql(\"INSERT INTO TABLE t PARTITION (p1 = 5) SELECT ID FROM range(1, 1)\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT MAX(p1) FROM t\")\r\n```\r\nThe result is supposed to be `null`. However, with the optimization the result is `5`.\r\n\r\nThe rule is originally ported from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1003 in #13494. In Hive, the rule is disabled by default in a later release(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15397), due to the same problem.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to completely avoid the correctness issue.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the edge case of streaming left/right outer join described below:\r\n\r\nSuppose query is provided as\r\n\r\n`select * from A join B on A.id = B.id AND (A.ts <= B.ts AND B.ts <= A.ts + interval 5 seconds)`\r\n\r\nand there're two rows for L1 (from A) and R1 (from B) which ensures L1.id = R1.id and L1.ts = R1.ts.\r\n(we can simply imagine it from self-join)\r\n\r\nThen Spark processes L1 and R1 as below:\r\n\r\n- row L1 and row R1 are joined at batch 1\r\n- row R1 is evicted at batch 2 due to join and watermark condition, whereas row L1 is not evicted\r\n- row L1 is evicted at batch 3 due to join and watermark condition\r\n\r\nWhen determining outer rows to match with null, Spark applies some assumption commented in codebase, as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChecking whether the current row matches a key in the right side state, and that key\t\r\nhas any value which satisfies the filter function when joined. If it doesn't,\t\r\nwe know we can join with null, since there was never (including this batch) a match\t\r\nwithin the watermark period. If it does, there must have been a match at some point, so\t\r\nwe know we can't join with null.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as explained the edge-case earlier, the assumption is not correct. As we don't have any good assumption to optimize which doesn't have edge-case, we have to track whether such row is matched with others before, and match with null row only when the row is not matched.\r\n\r\nTo track the matching of row, the patch adds a new state to streaming join state manager, and mark whether the row is matched to others or not. We leverage the information when dealing with eviction of rows which would be candidates to match with null rows.\r\n\r\nThis approach introduces new state format which is not compatible with old state format - queries with old state format will be still running but they will still have the issue and be required to discard checkpoint and rerun to take this patch in effect.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT which fails on current Spark and passes with this patch. Also passed existing streaming join UTs.","created_at":"2019-01-24T09:04:59Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T01:57:13Z","closed_at":"2019-10-14T07:27:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54f6a06cf644ddda3fee0543cf9ed91cfeca00e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a minor change in `Cast$mayTruncate` that fixes its logic for bytes.\r\n\r\nRight now, `mayTruncate(ByteType, LongType)` returns `false` while `mayTruncate(ShortType, LongType)` returns `true`. Consequently, `spark.range(1, 3).as[Byte]` and `spark.range(1, 3).as[Short]` behave differently.\r\n\r\nPotentially, this bug can silently corrupt someone's data.\r\n```scala\r\n// executes silently even though Long is converted into Byte\r\nspark.range(Long.MaxValue - 10, Long.MaxValue).as[Byte]\r\n  .map(b => b - 1)\r\n  .show()\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|  -12|\r\n|  -11|\r\n|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor making test suite supporting both Parquet and Orc by reusing test cases, this patch extracts the methods for testing. For example, if we need to test a common feature shared by Parquet and Orc, we should be able to write test cases once and reuse them to test both formats.\r\n\r\nThis patch extracts the methods for testing and uses a variable `dataSourceName` to set up data format to test against with.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

The client sends stream request to fetch block chunks, and old shuffle service can't support it.\r\n\r\nAfter 2 years, Spark 2.2 has EOL, and now it's safe to turn on this feature by default\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nThis is a correctness issue and should be backported as well. If we use dictionary encoding as below, it hits a correctness issue as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// Repeat the values for dictionary encoding. PLAIN_DICTIONARY.\r\nSeq(Some(\"A\"), Some(\"A\"), None).toDF.repartition(1).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/tmp/foo\")\r\nspark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/foo\").where(\"NOT (value <=> 'A')\").show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, if we don't use dictionary encoding it's fine. So it was difficult to find the issue.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// It becomes PLAIN encoding.\r\nSeq(Some(\"A\"), None).toDF.repartition(1).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/tmp/bar\")\r\nspark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/bar\").where(\"NOT (value <=> 'A')\").show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n| null|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How did it happen?\r\n\r\nThis is because Parquet side dictionary filter fails to handle `null`. The former case hits here:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n      Set<T> dictSet = expandDictionary(meta);\r\n      if (dictSet != null && dictSet.size() == 1 && dictSet.contains(value)) {\r\n        return BLOCK_CANNOT_MATCH;\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/apache-parquet-1.10.0/parquet-hadoop/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/filter2/dictionarylevel/DictionaryFilter.java#L182) for codes.\r\n\r\nGiven dictionary set does not contain `null` but only `'A'`. `value` (given to the predicate) is `'A'` here. So, it filters the row group out.\r\n\r\nThe latter case above works fine because it hits here:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    // if the chunk has non-dictionary pages, don't bother decoding the\r\n    // dictionary because the row group can't be eliminated.\r\n    if (hasNonDictionaryPages(meta)) {\r\n      return BLOCK_MIGHT_MATCH;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/apache-parquet-1.10.0/parquet-hadoop/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/filter2/dictionarylevel/DictionaryFilter.java#L176) for codes.\r\n\r\nSo, it does not filter the row group out.\r\n\r\nParquet equality predicate handles `null` too (see also [here](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/apache-parquet-1.10.0/parquet-column/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/filter2/predicate/Operators.java#L188)). Up to my knowledge, Parquet predicate is null-safe quality comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How does this PR fix?\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitly disables dictionary filtering if not set by default. However there's another problem:\r\n\r\nWe should disable `parquet.filter.dictionary.enabled` but Parquet 1.10.x has a mistake - the `parquet.filter.stats.enabled` and `parquet.filter.dictionary.enabled` were swapped mistakenly in Parquet side:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n      useDictionaryFilter(conf.getBoolean(STATS_FILTERING_ENABLED, true));\r\n      useStatsFilter(conf.getBoolean(DICTIONARY_FILTERING_ENABLED, true));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/apache-parquet-1.10.0/parquet-hadoop/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/HadoopReadOptions.java#L83-L84) for codes.\r\n\r\nThis is fixed after 1.11. See [PARQUET-1309](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-1309).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR explicitly disables `parquet.filter.stats.enabled` to disable dictionary filtering if that's not set by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### User side workaround\r\n\r\nThey can explicitly disable `parquet.filter.stats.enabled` to disable dictionary filtering.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ETC\r\n\r\n- This is quite a conservative fix. This should be backported to Spark 2.4.\r\n- I only tested null-safe equality comparison but looks regular equality comparison having related issues as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-23T05:47:07Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:20:08Z","closed_at":"2019-01-30T09:46:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b8d5937abb71013428e814a720dd6b72a42217d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23622/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23622/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23622/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb2eb2bd93394517716df9f47ab650078544e184","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:disable-dictionary","ref":"disable-dictionary","sha":"eb2eb2bd93394517716df9f47ab650078544e184","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo help debugging failed or slow tasks, its really useful to know the\r\nsize of the blocks getting fetched.  Though that is available at the\r\ndebug level, debug logs aren't on in general -- but there is already an\r\ninfo level log line that this augments a little.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan very basic local-cluster mode app, looked at logs.  Example line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: Getting 2 (194.0 B) non-empty blocks including 1 (97.0 B) local blocks and 1 (97.0 B) remote blocks\r\n```\r\n\r\nFull suite via

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-21568 made a change to ensure that progress bar is enabled for spark-shell\r\nby default but not for other apps. Before that change, this was distinguished\r\nusing log-level which is not a good way to determine the same as users can change\r\nthe default log-level. That commit changed the way to determine whether current\r\napp is running in spark-shell or not but it left the log-level part as it is,\r\nwhich causes this regression. SPARK-25118 changed the default log level to INFO\r\nfor spark-shell because of which the progress bar is not enabled anymore.\r\n\r\nThis commit will remove the log-level check for enabling progress bar for\r\nspark-shell as it is not necessary and seems to be a leftover from SPARK-21568\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Ensured that progress bar is enabled with spark-shell by default\r\n2. Ensured that progress bar is not enabled with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a user passes a Stream to groupBy, ```CodegenSupport.consume``` ends up lazily generating ```inputVars``` from a Stream, since the field ```output``` will be a Stream. At the time ```output.zipWithIndex.map``` is called, conditions are correct. However, by the time the map operation actually executes, conditions are no longer appropriate. The closure used by the map operation ends up using a reference to the partially created ```inputVars```. As a result, a StackOverflowError occurs.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that ```inputVars``` is eagerly created while conditions are appropriate. It seems this was also an issue with the code path for creating ```inputVars``` from ```outputVars``` (SPARK-25767). I simply extended the solution for that code path to encompass both code paths.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSQL unit tests\r\nnew test\r\npython tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-22T15:05:57Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T18:40:39Z","closed_at":"2019-01-24T10:18:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68bcdf4dad2cd21c68729558cf2f8f9ea21b7fe6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23617/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23617/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23617/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f2700506256e216d5f8e3a32f3e08a92e6543a7","head":{"label":"bersprockets:SPARK-26680_opt1","ref":"SPARK-26680_opt1","sha":"5f2700506256e216d5f8e3a32f3e08a92e6543a7","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

I think it's because spark does not handle disk broken in `DiskBlockManager` currently, even though there are always multi disk directories configured in a production environment.\r\n\r\nThough, we can probably bypass this error by enlarge settings  like `spark.yarn.maxAppAttemps`, but other apps may also suffer the same problem repeatedly which is annoying and unstable.... Also, for some large task, the retry will bring some downside, one major downside is that it will cause the delay of application completion(the extra recomputing time when retry for `ShuffleMapTask` and some extra schedule delay).\r\n\r\nActually, we can handle this case by simply adding a few of codes, for localDirs already mounted on  multiple disk for a production environment in most cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR will support blacklisting bad disk directory and switch to a good directory for writing. thus can improve the robustness.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith the changes from @vanzin's PR #23019 (SPARK-26025) we use a pared down temporary Docker build context which significantly improves build times.  However the way this is implemented leads to non-intuitive behaviour when supplying custom Docker file paths.  This is because of the following code snippets:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(cd $(img_ctx_dir base) && docker build $NOCACHEARG \"${BUILD_ARGS[@]}\" \\\r\n    -t $(image_ref spark) \\\r\n    -f \"$BASEDOCKERFILE\" .)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the script changes to the temporary build context directory and then runs `docker build` there any path given for the Docker file is taken as relative to the temporary build context directory rather than to the directory where the user invoked the script.  This is rather unintuitive and produces somewhat unhelpful errors e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> ./bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r rvesse -t badpath -p resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles/spark/bindings/python/Dockerfile build\r\nSending build context to Docker daemon  218.4MB\r\nStep 1/15 : FROM openjdk:8-alpine\r\n --->

Dockerfile path: lstat /Users/rvesse/Documents/Work/Code/spark/target/tmp/docker/pyspark/resource-managers: no such file or directory\r\nFailed to build PySpark Docker image, please refer to Docker build output for details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we can see that the relative path that was valid where the user typed the command was not valid inside the build context directory.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this we need to ensure that we are resolving relative paths to Docker files appropriately which we do by adding a `resolve_file` function to the script and invoking that on the supplied Docker file paths\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nValidated that relative paths now work as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> ./bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r rvesse -t badpath -p

Docker releases are stricter in their enforcement of build argument scope.  The location of the `ARG spark_uid` declaration in the Python and R Dockerfiles means the variable is out of scope by the time it is used in a `USER` declaration resulting in a container running as root rather than the default/configured UID.\r\n\r\nAlso with some of the refactoring of the script that has happened since my PR that introduced the configurable UID it turns out the `-u <uid>` argument is not being properly passed to the Python and R image builds when those are opted into\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis commit moves the `ARG` declaration to just before the argument is used such that it is in scope.  It also ensures that Python and R image builds receive the build arguments that include the `spark_uid` argument where relevant\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPrior to the patch images are produced where the Python and R images ignore the default/configured UID:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash rvesse/spark-py:uid456\r\nbash-4.4# whoami\r\nroot\r\nbash-4.4# id -u\r\n0\r\nbash-4.4# exit\r\n> docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash rvesse/spark:uid456\r\nbash-4.4$ id -u\r\n456\r\nbash-4.4$ exit\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the Python image is still running as `root` having ignored the configured UID of 456 while the base image has the correct UID because the relevant `ARG` declaration is correctly in scope.\r\n\r\nAfter the patch the correct UID is observed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash rvesse/spark-r:uid456\r\nbash-4.4$ id -u\r\n456\r\nbash-4.4$ exit\r\nexit\r\n> docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash rvesse/spark-py:uid456\r\nbash-4.4$ id -u\r\n456\r\nbash-4.4$ exit\r\nexit\r\n> docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash rvesse/spark:uid456\r\nbash-4.4$ id -u\r\n456\r\nbash-4.4$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark use `PooledByteBufAllocator` to allocate memory for channel reading. However, the allocated heap/offheap memory size is not tracked. Sometimes, this make it difficult to  find out the cause of OOM failures(for instance, direct memory oom) due to data skew. we have to use more advanced tools like MAT or pmap to locate the cause.\r\n\r\nActually, we can add some logs for `PooledByteBufAllocator` when allocating large memory, which can facilitate the debugging.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-22T09:18:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T17:04:04Z","closed_at":"2019-02-11T05:19:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a54fd025ed6d1bf2b138ef917fd96baeb1107cf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23610/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23610/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23610/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e1f9f0463aa80f6efa29359e856b2f5fa847a86e","head":{"label":"liupc:Add-logs-when-allocating-large-memory-for-pooledbytebufallocator","ref":"Add-logs-when-allocating-large-memory-for-pooledbytebufallocator","sha":"e1f9f0463aa80f6efa29359e856b2f5fa847a86e","user":{"login":"liupc","id":6747355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDczNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6747355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc","html_url":"https://github.com/liupc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75380071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTM4MDA3MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liupc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liupc","id":6747355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDczNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6747355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc","html_url":"https://github.com/liupc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liupc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liupc/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to fix issue on adding `current_timestamp` / `current_date` with streaming query. \r\n\r\nThe root reason is that Spark transforms `CurrentTimestamp`/`CurrentDate` to `CurrentBatchTimestamp` in MicroBatchExecution which makes transformed attributes not-yet-resolved. They will be resolved by IncrementalExecution.\r\n(In ContinuousExecution, Spark doesn't allow using `current_timestamp` and `current_date` so it has been OK.)\r\n\r\nIt's OK for DataSource V1 sink because it simply leverages transformed logical plan and don't evaluate until they're resolved, but for DataSource V2 sink, Spark tries to extract the schema of transformed logical plan in prior to IncrementalExecution, and unresolved attributes will raise errors.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue via having separate pre-resolved logical plan to pass the schema to StreamingWriteSupport safely.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds two logical plans that implement the ReplaceData operation from the [logical plans SPIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gYm5Ji2Mge3QBdOliFV5gSPTKlX4q1DCBXIkiyMv62A/edit?ts=5a987801#heading=h.m45webtwxf2d). These two plans will be used to implement Spark's `INSERT OVERWRITE` behavior for v2.\r\n\r\nSpecific changes:\r\n* Add `SupportsTruncate`, `SupportsOverwrite`, and `SupportsDynamicOverwrite` to DSv2 write API\r\n* Add `OverwriteByExpression` and `OverwritePartitionsDynamic` plans (logical and physical)\r\n* Add new plans to DSv2 write validation rule `ResolveOutputRelation`\r\n* Refactor `WriteToDataSourceV2Exec` into trait used by all DSv2 write exec nodes\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* The v2 analysis suite has been updated to validate the new overwrite plans\r\n* The analysis suite for `OverwriteByExpression` checks that the delete expression is resolved using the table's columns\r\n* Existing tests validate that overwrite exec plan works\r\n* Updated existing v2 test because schema is used to validate overwrite","created_at":"2019-01-21T23:08:13Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T12:49:35Z","closed_at":"2019-02-18T05:19:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61c89d66d0de1435536cbbbcb2dacbd82daeabe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23606/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23606/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23606/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e42cc28b173f55c645c863732fb13d1343d4d75","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-26666-add-overwrite","ref":"SPARK-26666-add-overwrite","sha":"0e42cc28b173f55c645c863732fb13d1343d4d75","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAvoid memory problems in closure cleaning when handling large Gramians (>= 16K rows/cols) by using null as zeroValue\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\nNote that it's hard to test the case that triggers this issue as it would require a large amount of memory and run a while. I confirmed locally that a 16K x 16K Gramian failed with tons of driver memory before, and didn't fail upfront after this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose using of the `stringToDate` and `stringToTimestamp` methods in parsing JDBC lower/upper bounds of the partition column if it has `DateType` or `TimestampType`. Since those methods have been ported on Proleptic Gregorian calendar by #23512, the PR switches parsing of JDBC bounds of the partition column on the calendar as well. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested by `JDBCSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-20T17:38:29Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:36:31Z","closed_at":"2019-01-23T12:23:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26101489fc4d19cccc6aee82b753cb9f6d405b3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/af204428fc8f32dfa385ca93d384707a46532681","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:jdbc-parse-timestamp-bounds","ref":"jdbc-parse-timestamp-bounds","sha":"af204428fc8f32dfa385ca93d384707a46532681","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Avoid using `Timestamp.valueOf` and `Date.valueOf` in parsing `TimestampType` and `DateType` literal values in `Literal.fromString` since the method uses the hybrid calendar (Julian+Gregorian) internally.\r\n- Replace the methods above by `stringToDate` and `stringToTimestamp` because they have been already ported on Proleptic Gregorian calendar which is required by SQL standard.\r\n- Reuse `Literal.fromString` from `AstBuilder` in parsing `Timestamp` and `Date` literal values.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe expressions `DayWeek`, `DayOfWeek`, `WeekDay` and `WeekOfYear` are changed to use Proleptic Gregorian calendar instead of the hybrid one (Julian+Gregorian). This was achieved by using Java 8 API for date/timestamp manipulation, in particular the `LocalDate` class.\r\n\r\nWeek of year calculation is performed according to ISO-8601. The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year (see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/IsoFields.html).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested by `DateExpressionsSuite` and `DateFunctionsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-19T19:25:16Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:36:30Z","closed_at":"2019-01-22T16:37:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"351e8cce6e2f52a613139fbe1c3a4d2945b8eded","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7aa536c0294a609d181c321bd0f84480ac79ad50","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:dayweek-gregorian","ref":"dayweek-gregorian","sha":"7aa536c0294a609d181c321bd0f84480ac79ad50","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ByteBuffer.allocate` may throw `OutOfMemoryError` when the block is large but no enough memory is available. However, when this happens, right now BlockTransferService.fetchBlockSync will just hang forever as its `BlockFetchingListener. onBlockFetchSuccess` doesn't complete `Promise`.\r\n\r\nThis PR catches `Throwable` and uses the error to complete `Promise`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test. Since I cannot make `ByteBuffer.allocate` throw `OutOfMemoryError`, I passed a negative size to make `ByteBuffer.allocate` fail. Although the error type is different, it should trigger the same code

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new conf flag that allows the user to set the value of `DecimalType.MINIMAL_ADJUSTED_SCALE`, currently a constant of 6, to match their workloads' needs.\r\n\r\nThe new flag is `spark.sql.decimalOperations.minimumAdjustedScale`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20023 introduced a new conf flag `spark.sql.decimalOperations.allowPrecisionLoss` to match SQL Server's and new Hive's behavior of allowing precision loss when performing multiplication/division on big and small decimal numbers.\r\nAlong with this feature, a constant `MINIMAL_ADJUSTED_SCALE` was set to 6 for when precision loss is allowed.\r\n\r\nSome customer workload may need a larger adjusted scale to match their business needs, and in exchange they may be willing to tolerate some more calculations overflowing the max precision, leading to nulls. So they would like the minimum adjusted scale to be configurable.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf buffer in `MemoryStore`'s `SerializedMemoryEntry` is allocated off-heap, current `clear()` action doesn't dispose them. These off-heap memory, though, will be freed when process ends, but for application that need to stop and restart `SparkContext` serveral times, this may cause some kind of off-heap memory leak. \r\nThis PR try to dispose off-heap memory by itself when clearing `MemoryStore`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually by running code written myself, while observing system resources monitor to verify off-heap memory allocation and free behavior.\r\nI have tried to add a unit test, but it's hard to find a way counting off-heap memory allocated by Unsafe API.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr proposes to improve partition statistics in `AnalyzePartitionCommand`:\r\n\r\n1.  Restore Spark partition statistics in `HiveExternalCatalog.listPartitions` and `HiveExternalCatalog.listPartitionsByFilter`. \r\n2.  Compare with old partition stats instead of old table stats in `AnalyzePartitionCommand`.\r\n\r\nThus partitions listed in `AnalyzePartitionCommand` would contain Spark stats and would not update HiveMetaStore if stats not changed.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6d9c54b62cee6fdf396f507caf7eb7f2e3f35b0a/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/command/AnalyzePartitionCommand.scala#L87\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nModified existing tests.","created_at":"2019-01-18T09:22:17Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T00:08:41Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T00:08:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cdaab63f3a08722616f0ba912b213866e5f6ba41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/208e3af10dc1b396b5e6d18159c3bc4c847ec0a5","head":{"label":"wangshuo128:SPARK-21213-FOLLOWUP","ref":"SPARK-21213-FOLLOWUP","sha":"208e3af10dc1b396b5e6d18159c3bc4c847ec0a5","user":{"login":"wangshuo128","id":4003322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDMzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4003322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128","html_url":"https://github.com/wangshuo128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133767975,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3Njc5NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"wangshuo128/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangshuo128","id":4003322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDMzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4003322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128","html_url":"https://github.com/wangshuo128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangshuo128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangshuo128/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, some ML library may generate large ml model, which may be referenced in the task closure, so driver will broadcasting large task binary, and executor may not able to deserialize it and result in OOM failures(for instance, executor's memory is not enough). This problem not only affects apps using ml library, some user specified closure or function which refers large data may also have this problem.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the debuging of memory problem caused by large taskBinary broadcast, we can add same warning logs for it.\r\n\r\nThis PR will add some warning logs on the driver side when broadcasting a large task binary, and it also included some minor log changes in the reading of broadcast.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNA-Just log changes.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`DataWritingCommandExec` generates `cmd.nodeName` twice in its explain output, e.g. when running this query `spark.sql(\"create table foo stored as parquet as select id, id % 10 as cat1, id % 20 as cat2 from range(10)\")`,\r\n```\r\nExecute OptimizedCreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand OptimizedCreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand [Database:default, TableName: foo, InsertIntoHiveTable]\r\n+- *(1) Project [id#2L, (id#2L % 10) AS cat1#0L, (id#2L % 20) AS cat2#1L]\r\n   +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=8)\r\n```\r\nAfter the fix, it'll go back to normal:\r\n```\r\nExecute OptimizedCreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand [Database:default, TableName: foo, InsertIntoHiveTable]\r\n+- *(1) Project [id#2L, (id#2L % 10) AS cat1#0L, (id#2L % 20) AS cat2#1L]\r\n   +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=8)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis duplication is introduced when this specialized `DataWritingCommandExec` was created in place of `ExecutedCommandExec`.\r\n\r\nThe former is a `UnaryExecNode` whose `children` include the physical plan of the query, and the `cmd` is picked up via `TreeNode.stringArgs` into the argument string. The duplication comes from: `DataWritingCommandExec.nodeName` is `s\"Execute ${cmd.nodeName}\"` while the argument string is `cmd.simpleString()` which also includes `cmd.nodeName`.\r\n\r\nThe latter didn't have that problem because it's a `LeafExecNode` with no children, and it declares the `cmd` as being a part of the `innerChildren` which is excluded from the argument string.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing of running the example above in a local Spark Shell.\r\nAlso added a new test case in `ExplainSuite`.","created_at":"2019-01-18T01:51:51Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T06:46:58Z","closed_at":"2019-01-18T06:46:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4596ca573f766cbf7969028706a0980ca69c734a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/176b4d02f2b40a28b3f9f0773ff0d532deffe000","head":{"label":"rednaxelafx:fix-explain","ref":"fix-explain","sha":"176b4d02f2b40a28b3f9f0773ff0d532deffe000","user":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89513466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTUxMzQ2Ng==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"rednaxelafx/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

to fix the serialization issue with large objects\r\n\r\nWhen a pyspark job using python 3 tries to serialize large objects, it throws a pickle error in case of trying to serialize global variable object and overflow error in case of broadcast. Refer the corresponding JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26658 for more details.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixed the issue by updating the pickle dump method in code to use protocol version 3 for python 3.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRunning manual tests before and after the fix.\r\n\r\nSteps To Reproduce:\r\n - To reproduce the above issue, I am using the word2vec model trained on the Google News dataset downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing\r\n - Use python 3.x with module gensim installed(or ship the module zip file using --py-files).\r\n\r\n - Launch pyspark with the following command:\r\n`bin/pyspark --master yarn --py-files additionalPythonModules.zip --conf spark.driver.memory=16g --conf spark.executor.memory=16g --conf spark.driver.memoryOverhead=16g --conf spark.executor.memoryOverhead=16g --conf spark.executor.pyspark.memory=16g`\r\n\r\n- Run the following commands. For the sake of reproducing the issue, I have simply pasted certain parts of the code here: \r\n`SparkSession available as 'spark'.\r\n>>> import gensim\r\n>>> score_threshold = 0.65\r\n>>> synonym_limit = 3\r\n>>> model = gensim.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('hdfs://home/pgandhi/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin', binary=True)\r\n>>> def isPhrase(word):\r\n...     if word.find('_') != -1 :\r\n...         return 1\r\n...     return 0\r\n... \r\n>>> def process_word(line):\r\n...             word = \"test\"\r\n...             positiveWords = []\r\n...             positiveWords.append(word)\r\n...             try :\r\n...                results = model.most_similar(positive=positiveWords)\r\n...                synonym_vec = []\r\n...                for i in range(len(results)) :\r\n...                   result = results[i]\r\n...                   if (result[1] > score_threshold ) :\r\n...                       synonym = result[0]\r\n...                       synonym = synonym.lower()\r\n...                       if (isPhrase(synonym)==0) and (word != synonym) :\r\n...                           synonym_vec.append(synonym)\r\n...                   if

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add support for multiple aggregates in append mode. In\r\nappend mode, the aggregates are emitted only after the watermark passes\r\nthe threshold (e.g. the window boundary) and the emitted value is not\r\naffected by further late data. This allows to chain multiple aggregates\r\nin 'Append' output mode without worrying about retractions etc.\r\n\r\nHowever the current event time watermarks in structured streaming are\r\ntracked at a global level and this does not work when aggregates are\r\nchained. The downstream watermarks usually lags the ones before and the\r\nglobal (min or max) watermarks will not let the stages make progress\r\nindependently.\r\n\r\nThe patch tracks the watermarks at each (stateful)\r\noperator so that the aggregate outputs are generated when the watermark\r\npasses the thresholds at the corresponding stateful operator. The values\r\nare also saved into the commit/offset logs (similar to global watermark)\r\n\r\nEach aggregate should have a corresponding watermark defined while\r\ncreating the query (E.g. via withWatermark) and this is used to\r\ntrack the progress of event time corresponding to the stateful operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew and existing unit tests\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-17T21:22:08Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T01:10:29Z","closed_at":"2021-01-08T01:10:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"954afa3ea5f6fa0ae2a51cfedd2b52d918ad05e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI always maintance a spark on yarn cluster on line.I always found the error:\r\n\r\n`Dropping event from queue eventLog. This likely means one of the listeners is too slow and cannot keep up with the rate at which tasks are being started by the scheduler.`\r\n\r\nSpark event log write to a hdfs cluster on line, and this hdfs cluster support write a few TB every day.The performance issuse of write frequently, lead to the `EventLoggingListener` exists the bottleneck.\r\n\r\nBut other event queue appear the problem rarely,so I think seperate the configurations of different event queue.\r\n\r\nFor spark user, this pr will provide four dynamic

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to explicitly document that SparkContext cannot be shared for multiprocessing, and multi-processing execution is not guaranteed in PySpark.\r\n\r\nI have seen some cases that users attempt to use multiple processes via `multiprocessing` module time to time. For instance, see the example in the JIRA (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25992).\r\n\r\nPy4J itself does not support Python's multiprocessing out of the box (sharing the same JavaGateways for instance).\r\n\r\nIn general, such pattern can cause errors with somewhat arbitrary symptoms difficult to diagnose. For instance, see the error message in JIRA:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nFile \"/Users/abdealijk/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/socketserver.py\", line 317, in _handle_request_noblock\r\n    self.process_request(request, client_address)\r\nFile \"/Users/abdealijk/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/socketserver.py\", line 348, in process_request\r\n    self.finish_request(request, client_address)\r\nFile \"/Users/abdealijk/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/socketserver.py\", line 361, in finish_request\r\n    self.RequestHandlerClass(request, client_address, self)\r\nFile \"/Users/abdealijk/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/socketserver.py\", line 696, in __init__\r\n    self.handle()\r\nFile \"/usr/local/hadoop/spark2.3.1/python/pyspark/accumulators.py\", line 238, in handle\r\n    _accumulatorRegistry[aid] += update\r\nKeyError: 0\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe root cause of this was because global `_accumulatorRegistry` is not shared across processes.\r\n\r\nUsing thread instead of process is quite easy in Python. See `threading` vs `multiprocessing` in Python - they can be usually direct replacement for each other. For instance, Python also support threadpool as well (`multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool`) which can be direct replacement of process-based thread pool (`multiprocessing.Pool`).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and manually built the doc.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-16T08:42:32Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:20:12Z","closed_at":"2019-01-16T15:28:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a725212f7f211b5a4fb287e29a5d48d368f19b8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23564/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23564/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23564/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/73846ab5c93c32a97aeae9b8c6b9ab640c2a4c2c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-25992","ref":"SPARK-25992","sha":"73846ab5c93c32a97aeae9b8c6b9ab640c2a4c2c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### What's the problem?\r\ncanCommit of OutputCommitCoordinator would allow the task of FetchFailure stage commit, which result in TaskCommitDenied for the task(with the same partition as the commit task of the fetchfailure stage) of retry stage. Because of TaskCommitDenied is not counting towards failure,  So the scheduler will constantly scheduling task and got TaskCommitDenied, thus causing the application hangs forever.\r\n\r\n### How does it happen?\r\nA detailed explaination for this:\r\nLet's say we have:\r\nstage 0.0 . (stage id 0, attempt 0)\r\n  - task 1.0 (task 1, attempt 0)\r\n\r\nStage 0.1 (stage id 0, attempt 1) started due to fetch failure for instance\r\n  - task 1.0 (task 1, attempt 0) . Equivalent with task 1.0 in stage 0.0\r\n\r\n1. Task 1.0 in stage 0.0 is successfuly compeleted after the the launch of Stage 0.1, it will hold the commit lock for partition 1. (Sure, because AuthorizedCommiters for partition 1 is not exist and the attempt is not failed.)\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/OutputCommitCoordinator.scala#L180\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/OutputCommitCoordinator.scala#L183\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/OutputCommitCoordinator.scala#L184\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/OutputCommitCoordinator.scala#L185\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/OutputCommitCoordinator.scala#L186\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/OutputCommitCoordinator.scala#L189\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/OutputCommitCoordinator.scala#L190\r\n2. Task 1.0 in stage 0.1 compeleted, it can not get the commit lock.

Because of TaskCommitDenied not counting towards failure, TaskSetManager.handleFailedTask would not abort despite the consecutive failure of task1.x for parition 1 in stage0.1.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/TaskEndReason.scala#L242\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala#L907\r\n\r\n4. task 1 will be readded to pendingTasks and scheduler will schedule Task1.1 later.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4915cb3adff6f1ec9638b24bfb74f83940ec3d95/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala#L927\r\n\r\n5.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor the below three thread configuration items applied to both driver and executor, \r\nspark.rpc.io.serverThreads\r\nspark.rpc.io.clientThreads\r\nspark.rpc.netty.dispatcher.numThreads,\r\nwe separate them to driver specifics and executor specifics.

spark.executor.rpc.io.clientThreads\r\nspark.driver.rpc.netty.dispatcher.numThreads < - > spark.executor.rpc.netty.dispatcher.numThreads\r\n\r\nSpark reads these specifics first and fall back to the common configurations.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nWe ran the SimpleMap app without shuffle for benchmark purpose to test Spark's scalability in HPC with omini-path NIC which has higher bandwidth than normal ethernet NIC. \r\n\r\nSpark's base version is 2.4.0.\r\nSpark ran in the Standalone mode. Driver was in a standalone node. \r\nAfter the separation, the performance is improved a lot in 256 nodes and 512 nodes. see below test results of SimpleMapTask before and after the enhancement.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we read a hive table and create RDDs in `TableReader`, it'll throw exception `java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.TextInputFormat cannot be cast to org.apache.hadoop.mapred.InputFormat` if the input format class of the table is from mapreduce package.\r\n\r\nNow we use NewHadoopRDD to deal with the new input format and keep HadoopRDD to the old one.\r\n\r\nThis PR is from #23506. We can reproduce this issue by executing the new test with the code in old version. When create a table with `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.....` input format, we will find the exception thrown in `org.apache.spark.rdd.HadoopRDD.getInputFormat(HadoopRDD.scala:190)`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd `ExecutorClassLoader.getResourceAsStream`, so that classes dynamically generated by the REPL can be accessed by user code as `InputStream`s for non-class-loading purposes, such as reading the class file for extracting method/constructor parameter names.\r\n\r\nCaveat: The convention in Java's `ClassLoader` is that `ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream()` should be considered as a convenience method of `ClassLoader.getResource()`, where the latter provides a `URL` for the resource, and the former invokes `openStream()` on it to serve the resource as an `InputStream`. The former should also catch `IOException` from `openStream()` and convert it to `null`.\r\n\r\nThis PR breaks this convention by only overriding `ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream()` instead of also overriding `ClassLoader.getResource()`, so after this PR, it would be possible to get a non-null result from the former, but get a null result from the latter. This isn't ideal, but it's sufficient to cover the main use case and practically it shouldn't matter.\r\nTo implement the convention properly, we'd need to register a URL protocol handler with Java to allow it to properly handle the `spark://` protocol, etc, which sounds like an overkill for the intent of this PR.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to @zsxwing for the initial investigation and fix suggestion.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test case in `ExecutorClassLoaderSuite` and `ReplSuite`.","created_at":"2019-01-16T06:12:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T23:24:12Z","closed_at":"2019-01-16T23:24:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae9aa01c1170c201c742fa754eccca4ac62f5217","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/386b7fd1dff5c11d0ee30c21d084dc2a6c046df1","head":{"label":"rednaxelafx:executorclassloader-getresourceasstream","ref":"executorclassloader-getresourceasstream","sha":"386b7fd1dff5c11d0ee30c21d084dc2a6c046df1","user":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89513466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTUxMzQ2Ng==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"rednaxelafx/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

In the context of `FileStreamSource.getBatch` (where verify is called) and `FileStreamSourceLog` (subclass of `HDFSMetadata`), this is usually okay because, in a streaming query with one file stream, the `batchIds` can never be empty:\r\n- A batch is planned only when the `FileStreamSourceLog` has seen new offset (that is, there are new data files). \r\n- So `FileStreamSource.getBatch` will be called on X to Y where X will always be > Y. This calls internally`HDFSMetadata.verifyBatchIds (X+1, Y)` with X+1-Y ids. \r\n\r\nFor example.,`FileStreamSource.getBatch(4, 5)` will call `verify(batchIds = Seq(5), start = 5, end = 5)`. However, the invariant of X > Y is not true when there are two file stream sources, as a batch may be planned even when only one of the file streams has data. So one of the file stream may not have data, which can call `FileStreamSource.getBatch(X, X)` -> `verify(batchIds = Seq.empty, start = X+1, end = X)` -> failure. \r\n\r\nNote that `FileStreamSource.getBatch(X, X)` gets called **only when restarting a query in a batch where a file source did not have data**. This is because in normal planning of batches, `MicroBatchExecution` avoids calling `FileStreamSource.getBatch(X, X)` when offset X has not changed. However, when restarting a stream at such a batch, `MicroBatchExecution.populateStartOffsets()` calls `FileStreamSource.getBatch(X, X)` (DataSource V1 hack to initialize the source with last known offsets) thus hitting this issue.\r\n\r\nThe minimum solution here is to skip verification when `FileStreamSource.getBatch(X, X)`. \r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a `spark.sql.maxRepeatedAliasSize` config option, which specifies the maximum size of an aliased expression to be substituted (in CollapseProject and PhysicalOperation).  This prevents large aliased expressions from being substituted multiple times and exploding the size of the expression tree, eventually OOMing the driver.\r\n\r\nThe default config value of 100 was chosen through testing to find the optimally performant value:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17480705/51204201-dd285300-18b7-11e9-8781-dd698df00389.png)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests, and did manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change exposes the `df` (document frequency) as a public val along with the number of documents (`m`) as part of the IDF model. \r\n\r\n* The document frequency is returned as an `Array[Long]`\r\n* If the minimum  document frequency is set, this is considered in the df calculation. If the count is less than minDocFreq, the df is 0 for such terms\r\n* numDocs is not very required. But it can be useful, if we plan to provide a provision in future for user to give their own idf function, instead of using a default (log((1+m)/(1+df))). In such cases, the user can provide a function taking input of `m` and `df` and returning the idf value\r\n* Pyspark changes\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing test case was edited to also check for the document frequency values.\r\n\r\nI  am not very good with python or pyspark. I have committed and run tests based on my understanding.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- solves the current issue with --packages in cluster mode (there is no ticket for it). Also note of some [issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22657) of the past here when hadoop libs are used at the spark submit side.\r\n- supports spark.jars, spark.files, app jar.\r\n\r\nIt works as follows:\r\nSpark submit uploads the deps to the HCFS. Then the driver serves the deps via the Spark file server.\r\nNo hcfs uris are propagated.\r\n\r\nThe related design document is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1peg_qVhLaAl4weo5C51jQicPwLclApBsdR1To2fgc48/edit). the next option to add is the RSS but has to be improved given the discussion in the past about it (Spark 2.3). \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Run integration test suite.\r\n- Run an example using S3: \r\n\r\n```\r\n ./bin/spark-submit \\\r\n...\r\n --packages com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk:1.7.4,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:2.7.6 \\\r\n --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n --name spark-pi \\\r\n --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \\\r\n --conf spark.executor.memory=1G \\\r\n --conf spark.kubernetes.namespace=spark \\\r\n --conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.serviceAccountName=spark-sa \\\r\n --conf spark.driver.memory=1G \\\r\n --conf spark.executor.instances=2 \\\r\n --conf spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled=true \\\r\n --conf \"spark.driver.extraJavaOptions=-Divy.cache.dir=/tmp -Divy.home=/tmp\" \\\r\n --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image.pullPolicy=Always \\\r\n --conf spark.kubernetes.container.image=skonto/spark:k8s-3.0.0 \\\r\n --conf spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path=s3a://fdp-stavros-test \\\r\n --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key=... \\\r\n --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.impl=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem \\\r\n --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.fast.upload=true \\\r\n --conf spark.kubernetes.executor.deleteOnTermination=false \\\r\n --conf spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key=... \\\r\n --conf spark.files=client:///...resolv.conf \\\r\nfile:///my.jar **\r\n```\r\nAdded integration tests based on [Ceph nano](https://github.com/ceph/cn). Looks very [active](http://www.sebastien-han.fr/blog/2019/02/24/Ceph-nano-is-getting-better-and-better/).\r\nUnfortunately minio needs hadoop >=

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr added a new API to analyze cached data in `CacheManager`. In common use cases, users read catalog table data, join/aggregate them, and then cache the result for following reuse. Since we are only allowed to analyze column statistics in catalog tables via ANALYZE commands, the current optimization depends on non-existing or inaccurate column statistics of cached data. So, it would be great if we could analyze cached data as follows;\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"SET spark.sql.cbo.enabled=true\")\r\nscala> sql(\"SET
