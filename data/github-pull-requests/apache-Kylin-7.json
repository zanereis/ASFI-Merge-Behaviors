Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWith spark 2.X, when set 'spark.sql.adaptive.enabled' to true, it will impact the actually partition count when doing repartition with spark, which will lead to the wrong results for global dict and repartition by shardby column.\r\n\r\nFor example, after writing a cuboid data, kylin will repartition the cuboid data with 3 partition if need, but if 'spark.sql.adaptive.enabled' is true, spark will optimize the partition num to 1, which leads to wrong.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If this change need a document change, I will prepare another pr against the `document` branch\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin

Proposed changes\r\n\r\norg.apache.kylin.stream.core.storage.columnar.ColumnarMemoryStorePersister#persist will catch exception and just log it, this behavior will cause critical problem, like our case: there is no space left on device, `persist` method failed for many times, we lost several hours of data.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If this change need a document change, I will prepare another pr against the `document` branch\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nHere is our solution which already tested:\r\n\r\n1.Throw IllegalStorageException while we cannot do the persist\r\n2.Then stop the consumer thread\r\n3.Add `consumer_thread_alive` in ConsumerStats for monitoring\r\n4.Also fix another issue which will cause wrong result after restore from checkpoint\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-08T13:48:01Z","updated_at":"2021-05-14T02:52:59Z","closed_at":"2021-05-14T02:52:59Z","merged_at":"2021-05-14T02:52:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"8497add0b8d04647ea8cf0ff2265af46104a88a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hit-lacus","id":14030549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMwNTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14030549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus","html_url":"https://github.com/hit-lacus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hit-lacus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1481367935,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDgxMzY3OTM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/labels/Kylin%203.X","name":"Kylin

level\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find many use cases should use cube-level lookup table snapshot instead of segment-level ones. For segment-level ones, it will cause many issues. For example for table BATCH_VIEWS.xxx, it changes everyday. Now there're around 2000 snapshots.\r\n\r\nFor building a new snapshot, it will check the duplication to avoid duplicated snapshots, which means it will check all of the 2000 snapshots. It really costs time.\r\nFor query & building, to cache the snapshot, if each takes around 6MB, the total will need around 12GB memory.\r\nAfter this change, we can not only speedup cubing but also reduce the burden of memory cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If this change need a document change, I will prepare another pr against the `document` branch\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin

scripts at the first startup to speed up the second startup. Now it is found that the dependent cache scripts are not fully utilized. Only some scripts use this file.

You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If this change need a document change, I will prepare another pr against the `document` branch\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin or dev@kylin
