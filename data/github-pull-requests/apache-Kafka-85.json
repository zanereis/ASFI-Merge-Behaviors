networking layer doesn't close `FileRecords` and assumes that they are already open when sending them over a channel. To support this pattern this commit changes the ownership model for `FileRawSnapshotReader` so that they are owned by `KafkaMetadataLog`. This includes:\r\n\r\n1. Changing `KafkaMetadataLog`'s `snapshotIds` form a `Set[OffsetAndEpoch]` to a `TreeMap[OffsetAndEpoch, Option[FileRawSnapshotReader]]`. This map contains all of the known snapshots. The value will be `Some` if a snapshot reader has been opened in the past.\r\n\r\n2. Split and change the functionality in `KafkaMetadataLog::removeSnapshotFilesBefore` so that a) `forgetSnapshotsBefore` removes any snapshot less that the given snapshot id from `snapshots`; b) `removeSnapshots` deletes the enumerated snapshots from `forgetSnapshotsBefore`.\r\n\r\n3. Change the interface `RawSnapshotReader` to not extend `Closeable` since only `KafkaMetadataLog` is responsible for closing snapshots. `FileRawSnapshotReader` implements `AutoCloseable`.\r\n\r\n4. Fixed the implementation of `handleFetchSnapshotRequest` in `KafkaRaftClient` so that `RawSnapshotReader` and the associated `FileRecords` are not close before sending to the network layer.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

PR is a precursor to the recovery logic refactor work ([KAFKA-12553](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12553)).**\r\n\r\nI have made a change to eliminate `Log.isLogDirOffline` attribute. This boolean also comes in the way of refactoring the recovery logic. This attribute was added in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9676. But it is redundant and can be eliminated in favor of looking up `LogDirFailureChannel` to check if the `logDir` is offline. The performance/latency implication of such a `ConcurrentHashMap` lookup inside `LogDirFailureChannel` should be very low given that `ConcurrentHashMap` reads are usually lock free.\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nRelying on existing unit/integration tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-29T22:42:04Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T23:49:33Z","closed_at":"2021-03-31T22:26:40Z","merged_at":"2021-03-31T22:26:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"b6278ee79da722f85aaefe7755a2be920887175c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10430/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10430/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10430/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/2d11384c7dfae06ddca3c7acc2c63831d70b023f","head":{"label":"kowshik:eliminate_logDirOffline_bool","ref":"eliminate_logDirOffline_bool","sha":"2d11384c7dfae06ddca3c7acc2c63831d70b023f","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

This iterator will be used by the time-ordered window store from the PR https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10331.\r\nThis iterator is more efficient when doing range queries.\r\n\r\nThe `RocksDBPrefixRangeIterator` uses a new bytes lexico comparator that compares two bytes by their prefixes only.\r\ni.e.\r\n```\r\ncomparator.compare(0001, 0001000F); // smallest key prefix is 4 bytes, so 0001 == 0001\r\ncomparator.compare(0001000F, 0001); // smallest key prefix is 4 bytes, so 0001 == 0001\r\ncomparator.compare(0002000F, 0001); // smallest key prefix is 4 bytes, so 0002 >

PR is a part of [KAFKA-10787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10787) umbrella task, replacing the previous implementation [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8404/). **In short, this PR provides automatic import ordering and checking configurations, which will be a foundation of actual code formatting tasks later.** Here are some backgrounds.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started [KAFKA-10787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10787), I thought it is a trivial one and can be resolved with only one PR. But it is entirely wrong.\r\n\r\n1. It modifies hundreds of files; it is not only hard to review but also, every time it has some code conflict with the trunk branch.\r\n2. As @mjsax already pointed out, the previous implementation omits the essential way of solving this problem - **automatic import formatter**. Since it includes the checkstyle rules only, it shows error messages for the import ordering violation and that's it.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons above, it is almost impossible to resolve this issue with one commit or PR.\r\n\r\nSo, I restarted this feature from scratch. First of all, I changed the approach like following:\r\n\r\n1. Take an incremental approach, i.e., enlarge the import ordering rules applied area gradually. (In other words, narrow down the exception area to the import ordering rules, step by step.)\r\n2. By adopting automatic code formatter, make the build tool to apply the import order automatically.\r\n\r\nThis approach has the advantages like:\r\n\r\n1. We can apply the import order step by step; it is feasible to review and greatly reduces the possibility of code conflict.\r\n2. The dev team doesn't have to care about the formatting anymore; the build tool automatically take cares of it.\r\n\r\nWith this scheme, we can expand the scope of auto-formatting and checkstyle incrementally.\r\n\r\nIn turn, I converted [KAFKA-10787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10787) into an umbrella one. As the first subtask, this PR do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Define the import ordering rule in checkstyle: `kafka`, `org.apache.kafka`, `com`, `net`, `org`, `java`, `javax` and static imports. It is identical to [what we discussed in the dev mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf6f49c845a3d48efe8a91916c8fbaddb76da17742eef06798fc5b24d%40%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E), except each package is grouped independely. (e.g., `kafka` and `org.apache.kafka` are regarded as independent groups.)\r\n2. Add an eclipse formatter file, which includes:\r\n    - Minimal formatting rules that follow current checkstyle rules.\r\n    - `ImportOrder` rule for the newly introduced import ordering rule.\r\n3. **Add a spotless configuration to reformat the subset of modules automatically.**\r\n\r\nHere are some reasons for the decisions I made:\r\n\r\n1. Why choose eclipse formatter?\r\n\r\n    As all of you know, Apache Kafka is using gradle as its build tool. To automatically apply the import ordering rule with gradle, we have to use [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless), which supports two formatters - google formatter and eclipse formatter.\r\n    \r\n    If we choose google formatter, it changes not only import ordering but also the other aspects of code, like an indentation. To minimize non-import ordering modifications, I choose eclipse formatter, which supports a custom formatter configuration.\r\n\r\n    As you can see here, the formatter defines a minimal rules for out code only.\r\n\r\n2. The original proposal consists of 3 groups: `kafka`/`org.apache.kafka`, `com`/`org`/`net`, `java`/`javax`, and static imports. Why are those packages separated into independent groups?\r\n\r\n    It's simple - the spotless automatic formatter doesn't allow packages with different prefixes into one group. So I separated them.\r\n\r\n**\\* Updated (June 10th 2021): The `core` module is excluded from the PR, and it now only focuses on providing auto-formatting configurations.**\r\n\r\n### Committer

PR is a precursor to the recovery logic refactor work ([KAFKA-12553](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12553)).\r\n\r\n**Problems:**\r\nFor refactoring the recovery logic ([KAFKA-12553](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12553)), we would like to [move the logic to initialize](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/d9bb2ef596343da9402bff4903b129cff1f7c22b/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/Log.scala#L579) `LeaderEpochFileCache` out of the `Log` class and into a separate static function. In the future, once we successfully initialize `LeaderEpochFileCache` outside `Log`, we will be able pass it as a dependency into both the `Log` recovery module and `Log` class constructor. However, currently the `LeaderEpochFileCache` constructor takes a [dependency](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/d9bb2ef596343da9402bff4903b129cff1f7c22b/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/epoch/LeaderEpochFileCache.scala#L42) on `logEndOffset` (via a callback), which poses the following problems:\r\n1. Blocks the instantiation of `LeaderEpochFileCache` outside `Log` class. Because, outside `Log` the `logEndOffset` is unavailable to be passed into `LeaderEpochFileCache` constructor. As a result, this situation blocks the recovery logic ([KAFKA-12553](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12553)) refactor work.\r\n2. It turns out the `logEndOffset` dependency is used only in 1 of the `LeaderEpochFileCache` methods: `LeaderEpochFileCache.endOffsetFor`, and just for 1 particular case. Therefore, it is overkill to pass it in the constructor as a dependency. Also a callback is generally not a neat way to access dependencies and it poses code readability problems too.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nThis PR modifies the code such that we only pass the `logEndOffset` as a parameter into `LeaderEpochFileCache.endOffsetFor` whenever the method is called, thus eliminating the constructor dependency. This will also unblock the recovery logic refactor work ([KAFKA-12553](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12553)).\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nI have modified the existing tests to suit the above refactor.","created_at":"2021-03-29T08:42:46Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T00:31:27Z","closed_at":"2021-03-31T00:31:27Z","merged_at":"2021-03-31T00:31:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"b35704a8431a5ea99b4da3ae3b344da92c42859c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10426/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10426/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10426/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c076d5cdfde65c91ef2ef626962e757481a7fe16","head":{"label":"kowshik:refactor_eliminate_LogEndOffset_dependency_on_LeaderEpochFileCache","ref":"refactor_eliminate_LogEndOffset_dependency_on_LeaderEpochFileCache","sha":"c076d5cdfde65c91ef2ef626962e757481a7fe16","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

a `@Property` tests fail, jqwik helpfully reports the initial seed that resulted in the failure. For example, if we are executing a test scenario 100 times and it fails on the 51st run, then we will get the initial seed that generated . But if you specify the seed in the `@Property` annotation as the previous comment suggested, then the test still needs to run 50 times before we get to the 51st case, which makes debugging very difficult given the complex nature of the simulation tests. Jqwik also gives us the specific argument list that failed, but that is not very helpful at the moment since `Random` does not have a useful `toString` which indicates the initial seed. \r\n\r\nTo address these problems, I've changed the `@Property` methods to take the random seed as an argument directly so that it is displayed clearly in the output of a failure.

been amassing more and more `catch` blocks around the `runOnce` loop in the StreamThread's `runLoop`. Some of these have complex handling which is performed inside the catch block, such as `handleCorrupted` which itself can throw exceptions (see KAFKA-12523). \r\n\r\nWe also have a final `catch Throwable` block which invokes the exception handler on any unexpected exceptions. But since this is part of the same `try` as the other catch blocks, exceptions thrown from eg `handleCorrupted` will bypass the `catch Throwable` block and miss the exception handler. \r\n\r\nAlso simplifies the EOS vs ALOS code paths by just returning false from the `runLoop` regardless of processing mode\r\n\r\nThis should probably be cherrypicked back to the 2.8 branch cc @vvcephei

the preferred replica is the partition leader directly affects the external output traffic of the broker. When the preferred replica of all partitions becomes the leader, the external output traffic of the broker will be in a balanced state. When there are a large number of partition leaders that are not preferred replicas, it will be destroyed this state of balance.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the controller will periodically check the unbalanced ratio of the partition preferred replicas (if enabled) to trigger the preferred replica election, or manually trigger the election through the kafka-leader-election tool. However, if we want to know which partition leader is in the non-preferred replica, we need to look it up in the controller log or judge ourselves from the topic details list.\r\n\r\nWe can add the --under-preferred-replica-partitions configuration option in TopicCommand describe topics to query the list of partitions in the current cluster that are in non-preferred replicas.\r\n\r\n###

PR is a precursor to the recovery logic refactor work ([KAFKA-12553](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12553)).**\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I've extracted the behavior surrounding segments map access within `kafka.log.Log` class into a new class: `kafka.log.LogSegments`. This class encapsulates a thread-safe navigable map of `kafka.log.LogSegment` instances and provides the required read and write behavior on the map. The `Log` class now encapsulates an instance of the `LogSegments` class.\r\n\r\nCouple advantages of this PR:\r\n * Makes the `Log` class a bit more modular as it moves out certain private behavior thats otherwise within the `Log` class.\r\n * This is a precursor to refactoring the recovery logic (KAFKA-12553). In the future, the logic for recovery and loading of segments from disk (during `Log`) init will reside outside the `Log` class. Such logic would need to instantiate and access an instance of the newly added `LogSegments` class.\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nAdded a new test suite: `kafka.log.LogSegmentsTest` covering the APIs of the newly introduced class.","created_at":"2021-03-25T07:52:24Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T16:51:50Z","closed_at":"2021-03-30T16:51:50Z","merged_at":"2021-03-30T16:51:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"d92d464b124f7e94cc240f062c6f96813ecb76d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9dbb679736133877226a2ee705f964cb5ae75efc","head":{"label":"kowshik:refactor_extract_LogSegments_class","ref":"refactor_extract_LogSegments_class","sha":"9dbb679736133877226a2ee705f964cb5ae75efc","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

noticed this test hanging frequently locally. There is a race condition between the background thread calling `ready` and the call to `MockTime.sleep` in the test. If the call to `sleep` happens first, then the test hangs. I fixed it by giving `MockClient` a way to listen to `ready` calls. This combined with a latch fixes the race.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

a distributed worker fails to write (or read back) a new session key to/from the config topic, it dies.\r\n\r\nThis fix softens the blow a bit by instead restarting the herder tick loop anew and forcing a read to the end of the config topic until the worker is able to successfully read to the end.\r\n\r\nAt this point, if the worker was able to successfully write a new session key in its first attempt, it will have read that key back from the config topic and will not write a new key during the next tick iteration. If it was not able to write that key at all, it will try again to write a new key (if it is still the leader).\r\n\r\nVerified with new unit tests for both cases (failure to write, failure to read back after write).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

we find a `.swap` file on startup, we typically want to rename and replace it as `.log`, `.index`, `.timeindex`, etc. as a way to complete any ongoing replace operations. These swap files are usually known to have been flushed to disk before the replace operation begins.\r\n\r\nOne flaw in the current logic is that we recover these swap files on startup and as part of that, end up truncating the producer state and rebuild it from scratch. This is unneeded as the replace operation does not mutate the producer state by itself. It is only meant to replace the `.log` file along with corresponding indices. Because of this unneeded producer state rebuild operation, we have seen multi-hour startup times for clusters that have large compacted topics.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue by doing a sanity check of all records in the segment to swap and rebuilds corresponding indices without mutating the producer state. Similarly, we also rebuild indices without truncating the producer state when we find a missing or corrupted index in the middle of the log.\r\n\r\nThe patch also adds an extra sanity check to detect invalid bytes at the end of swap segments. Before this patch, we would truncate invalid bytes from the swap segment which could leave us with holes in the log. Because this is an unexpected scenario, we now raise an exception in such cases which will fail the broker on startup.","created_at":"2021-03-23T16:52:01Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T23:41:44Z","closed_at":"2021-06-09T23:41:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9c9c87c1237900710cd0b2716be05ccb05847fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5e3e0c6b29ef2c97944acb1c1ffe4f9f27dfdd1b","head":{"label":"dhruvilshah3:producer-state","ref":"producer-state","sha":"5e3e0c6b29ef2c97944acb1c1ffe4f9f27dfdd1b","user":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121815241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjE4MTUyNDE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"dhruvilshah3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3/kafka","description":"Mirror

[current Cast SMT](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/connect/transforms/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/transforms/Cast.java) fails on a null record value (or a null record key), which is problematic for tombstone records. When a tombstone record reaches the transformation the error below is thrown:\r\n\r\nWith schema:\r\n```\r\nCannot list fields on non-struct type\r\norg.apache.kafka.connect.errors.DataException: Cannot list fields on non-struct type\r\n\tat org.apache.kafka.connect.data.ConnectSchema.fields(ConnectSchema.java:179)\r\n\tat org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Cast.getOrBuildSchema(Cast.java:190)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor schemaless:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.kafka.connect.errors.DataException: Only Map objects supported in absence of schema for [cast types], found: null\r\nat org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.util.Requirements.requireMap(Requirements.java:38)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nNull value records should instead be allowed to pass through as there is no cast transformation to be done, with the benefit of allowing the connector to handle the tombstone records as intended. \r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nAdded SMT unit tests to verify the records pass through when the keys or values are null. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12495\r\n\r\nAllow consecutive revoke in incremental cooperative assignor in connector, to fix the issue that when new members joined right after revocation round, it causes uneven distribution. (please check the jira for better understanding) What I did are:\r\n\r\n1. remove `canRevoke` variable, since we allow consecutive revoking (as lone as `delay == 0`) now\r\n2. compute `currentWorkerAssignmentWithoutDuplication`, to remove duplicated connectors/tasks from `currentWorkerAssignment`, so that we can use it in `performTaskRevocation` method, to compute if we need to revoke more connectors/tasks in this round by computing if the remaining assignments in each worker is higher than totalTasks/totalWorkers\r\n3. we also passed the configured assignment into `performTaskRevocation` instead of `activeAssignment`, so that we can compute the correct expected max assignment number (**totalSize** / workerSize), instead of the **activeTotalSize** / workerSize, because the **activeTotalSize** doesn't include the `newAssignments`, which will cause the wrong computation, and cause uneven rebalance, or need more round of revoking rebalance.\r\n4. Improve readability for tests by adding final assignment visualization for each phase of rebalance\r\n\r\nWith the change of (2) and (3), we can still make sure the revocation is always correct no matter if this is a consecutive revoking, or we have duplicated assignment.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-20T03:58:00Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T02:13:49Z","closed_at":"2022-08-29T02:13:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12958334a7fd6911d79f51a0b039f7a49429b3b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/1af943b711b1d54515b8b644962f51c2ce4d831d","head":{"label":"showuon:KAFKA-12495","ref":"KAFKA-12495","sha":"1af943b711b1d54515b8b644962f51c2ce4d831d","user":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":249690395,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDk2OTAzOTU=","name":"kafka","full_name":"showuon/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/showuon/kafka","description":"Mirror

is possible that an existing Cluster ID in Zookeeper is not convertible to a UUID.  KIP-500 cannot constrain Cluster IDs to be convertible to a UUID and still expect such a cluster to be able to upgrade to KIP-500.  This patch removes this UUID constraint and makes KIP-500 consistent with existing RPCs, which treat Cluster ID as a String.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that an existing Cluster ID in Zookeeper would not be convertible to a UUID because the Cluster ID is auto-generated in the form of a UUID and stored in ZooKeeper as soon as the first broker connects.  However, there is nothing preventing someone from generating a Cluster ID that does not conform to the UUID format and manually storing/bootstrapping that in ZooKeeper before the first broker

allow users to avoid the second rolling bounce when upgrading to cooperative rebalancing, we can dynamically upgrade the rebalancing protocol based on the assignor that's selected during a rebalance. This assignor is chosen by the group coordinator as the most-preferred assignor which is commonly supported by all members of the group. The assignor preference is just tied to the order in which they are listed in the `partition.assignment.strategy` config.\r\n\r\nWith this in place, a user can upgrade to cooperative rebalancing following a single rolling bounce. During the upgrade they must add the \"cooperative-sticky\" assignor to the front of the `partition.assignment.strategy` list. If the application hasn't set this config, then they will need to set it to `[\"cooperative-sticky\", \"range\"]`. After the rolling bounce is complete, all of the members will upgrade their protocol to COOPERATIVE.\r\n\r\nTo avoid unsafe downgrades to versions which don't support cooperative rebalancing, we throw IllegalStateException if we discover that the selected assignor's highest supported protocol is lower than the one currently being used by the consumer.","created_at":"2021-03-18T01:03:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-01T03:41:49Z","closed_at":"2025-01-01T03:41:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale
