What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for the SELECT operator.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t(x INT, y STRING) USING

unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr adds two new check condition sto the `launcher.AbstractCommandBuilder#buildClassPath` method:\r\n\r\nWhen `SPARK_PREPEND_CLASSES` is true, it no longer prepending the class path of the `sql/hive` module when `spark-hive_xxx.jar` is not in the classpath. The assumption here is that if `spark-hive_xxx.jar` is not in the classpath, then the `-Phive` profile was not used during package, and therefore the Hive-related jars（such as hive-exec-xx.jar） should also not be in the classpath. To avoid failure in loading the SPI in `DataSourceRegister` under `sql/hive`, so no longer prepend `sql/hive`. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, due to the strong dependency of `sql/hive-thriftserver` on `sql/hive`, the prepend for `sql/hive-thriftserver` will also be excluded if `spark-hive_xxx.jar` is not in the classpath. On the other hand, if `spark-hive-thriftserver_xxx.jar` is not in the classpath, then the `-Phive-thriftserver` profile was not used during package, and therefore, jars such as hive-cli and hive-beeline should also not be included in the classpath. To avoid the inelegant startup failures of tools such as spark-sql, in this scenario, `sql/hive-thriftserver` will no longer be prepended to the classpath.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix some bad cases during development,  one of them is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean package\r\nexport SPARK_PREPEND_CLASSES=true\r\nbin/spark-shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWelcome to\r\n

the discussion from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47425 to this PR because I can't push to Yuchen's account\r\n\r\n###  What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe builtin ProtoBuf connector first supports recursive schema reference. It is approached by letting users specify an option “recursive.fields.max.depth”, and at the start of the execution, unroll the recursive field by this level. It converts a problem of dynamic schema for each row to a fixed schema which is supported by Spark. Avro can just adopt a similar method. This PR defines an option \"recursiveFieldMaxDepth\" to both Avro data source and from_avro function. With this option, Spark can support Avro recursive schema up to certain depth.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecursive reference denotes the case that the type of a field can be defined before in the parent nodes. A simple example is:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"record\",\r\n  \"name\": \"LongList\",\r\n  \"fields\" : [\r\n    {\"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"long\"},\r\n    {\"name\": \"next\", \"type\": [\"null\", \"LongList\"]}\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is written in Avro Schema DSL and represents a linked list data structure. Spark currently will throw an error on this schema. Many users used schema like this, so we should support it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Previously, it will throw error on recursive schemas like above. With this change, it will still throw the same error by default but when users specify the option to a number greater than 0, the schema will be unrolled to that depth.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests and integration tests to AvroSuite and AvroFunctionSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd the option to `applyInArrow` to take a function that takes an iterator of `RecordBatch` and returns an iterator of `RecordBatch`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBeing limited to returning a single Table requires collecting all results in memory for a single batch. This can require excessive memory for certain edge cases that might require returning a larger number of rows. Currently the Python worker immediately converts a table into it's underlying batches, so there's barely any changes required to accommodate this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new function signature supported by `applyInArrow`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing UTs to test both Table signatures and RecordBatch signatures\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-09-09T16:34:40Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T13:59:23Z","closed_at":"2025-02-08T13:59:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48038/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48038/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48038/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/af6412f254d57aa0add625ce9400535f074e8192","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:apply-in-arrow-iterator","ref":"apply-in-arrow-iterator","sha":"af6412f254d57aa0add625ce9400535f074e8192","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358979577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg5Nzk1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"Kimahriman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSave the RDD created by doExecute, instead of creating a new one in execute each time.\r\n\r\nCurrently, many types of SparkPlans already save the RDD they create. For example, shuffle just save `lazy val inputRDD: RDD[InternalRow] = child.execute()`. It creates inconsistencies when an action (e.g. repeated `df.collect()`) is executed on Dataframe twice:\r\n* The SparkPlan will be reused, since the same `df.queryExecution.executedPlan` will be used.\r\n* Any not-result stage will be reused, as the shuffle operators will just have their `inputRDD` reused.\r\n* However, for result stage, `execute()` will call `doExecute()` again, and the logic of generating the actual execution RDD will be reexecuted for the result stage.\r\n\r\nThis means that for example for the result stage, WSCG code gen will generate and compile new code, create a new RDD out of it. Generation of execution RDDs is also often influenced by config: for example, staying with WSCG, various configs like `spark.sql.codegen.hugeMethodLimit` or `spark.sql.codegen.methodSplitThreshold`. The fact that upon re-execution this will be evaluated anew for the result stage, but not for earlier stages creates inconsistencies in what config changes are visible.\r\n\r\nBy saving the result of `doExecute` and reusing the RDD in `execute` we make sure that work in creating that RDD is not duplicated, and it is more consistent that all RDDs of the plan are reused, same as with the `executedPlan`.\r\n\r\nNote, that while the results of earlier shuffle stages are also reused, the result stage still does get executed again, as the result of it are not saved and available for Reuse in BlockManager.\r\n\r\nWe also add a `Lazy` utility instead of using `lazy val` to deal with shortcomings of scala lazy val.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nResolved subtle inconsistencies coming from object reuse vs. recreating objects from scratch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nSubtle changes caused by the RDD being reused, e.g. when a config change might be picked up. However, it makes things more consistent. Spark 4.0.0 might be a good candidate for making such a change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting SQL execution tests validate that the change in SparkPlan works.\r\nTests were added for the new Lazy utility.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nGenerated-by: Github Copilot\r\n(trivial code completion suggestions)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-09T16:08:08Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T15:20:20Z","closed_at":"2024-09-23T03:39:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e9394ad9c67dbff4654b5ef757a5a61425a8d389","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb63033aad0336988bc61276252a97392b841d7c","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-48195-rdd","ref":"SPARK-48195-rdd","sha":"eb63033aad0336988bc61276252a97392b841d7c","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate internal col families start identifier to a different one\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSome users might choose to use `_` as the start character for their state variable name as well as argument. Hence we update the internal col families start identifier to the `$` char. Scala [lexical identifiers](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.13/01-lexical-syntax.html) follow the same rule and Python also doesn't allow [vars](https://gawron.sdsu.edu/python_for_ss/course_core/book_draft/Python_introduction/variables.html) to start with this char.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 3 seconds, 442 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 4\r\n[info]

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to rename the `errorClass` parameter of the `checkError()` functions (and related and similar functions) to `condition` to follow the naming convention introduced by SPARK-46810.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncheckError(\r\n  exception = e,\r\n  condition = \"UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION\",\r\n  parameters = Map(\"objectName\" -> \"`non_exist`\", \"proposal\" -> \"`i`, `j`\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo follow new naming convention introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44902.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the changes affect **only in tests**.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suites and GAs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-08T20:42:52Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T07:36:07Z","closed_at":"2024-09-10T15:16:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9609e414b6c07afb0916984fbcf89aaa6ff47676","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to detect unused error message parameters while substituting placeholders in error message formats, and raise an internal error in tests when the number of parameters is greater than the number of placeholders. That might indicate presence of unused message parameters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMight happens that the passed error message parameters and placeholders in message format are not matched, and contain extra items. From the code maintainability perspective, it would be nice to detect such cases while running tests.\r\n\r\nFor example, the error message format could look like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"CANNOT_UP_CAST_DATATYPE\" : {\r\n  \"message\" : [\r\n    \"Cannot up cast <expression> from <sourceType> to <targetType>.\",\r\n    \"<details>\"\r\n    ],\r\n  \"sqlState\" : \"42846\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\n \r\nbut the passed message parameters have extra parameter:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nmessageParameters = Map(\r\n  \"expression\" -> \"CAST('aaa' AS LONG)\",\r\n  \"sourceType\" -> \"STRING\",\r\n  \"targetType\" -> \"LONG\",\r\n  \"op\" -> \"CAST\", // unused parameter\r\n  \"details\" -> \"implicit cast\"\r\n))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can happen because:\r\n- tech editor/dev forgot to mention some parameters in error message format,\r\n- wrong usage of error conditions/sub-conditions\r\n- source code became outdated\r\n- typos in error message formats\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the added test via:\r\n```\r\n$ build/mvn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.SparkThrowableSuite test\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-08T09:59:10Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T01:28:48Z","closed_at":"2024-09-10T06:33:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07d5d288c1aaf121cfedbda93c27381016479fc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improve Join stats estimate when column stats exist.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nLeft side:\r\n```\r\n36126 bytes, 2150 rows\r\n```\r\n\r\ninfo_name | info_value\r\n-- | --\r\ncol_name | key-1980\r\ndata_type | string\r\ncomment | NULL\r\nmin | NULL\r\nmax | NULL\r\nnum_nulls | 1\r\ndistinct_count | 1980\r\navg_col_len | 9\r\nmax_col_len | 38\r\nhistogram | NULL\r\n\r\nRight side:\r\n```\r\n13250653950 bytes, 1470064309 rows\r\n```\r\n\r\ninfo_name | info_value\r\n-- | --\r\ncol_name | key-3896196\r\ndata_type | string\r\ncomment | NULL\r\nmin | NULL\r\nmax | NULL\r\nnum_nulls | 320713790\r\ndistinct_count | 3896196\r\navg_col_len | 8\r\nmax_col_len | 69\r\nhistogram | NULL\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n+- Join Inner, (key-1980#388 = key-3896196#382), Statistics(sizeInBytes=71.1 MiB, rowCount=8.11E+5)\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\n+- Join Inner, (key-1980#388 = key-3896196#382), Statistics(sizeInBytes=106.9 GiB, rowCount=1.25E+9)\r\n```\r\nThe actual number of rows is [380,857,863](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13071429/enable%20CBO.png). The new statistics make much more reasonable than the previous ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Avoid broadcast join fail.\r\n   ```\r\n   org.apache.spark.SparkException: Cannot broadcast the table that is larger than 4GB: 4GB\r\n   ```\r\n2. Avoid Spark driver OOM.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-07T16:51:30Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T00:25:27Z","closed_at":"2024-12-23T00:25:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4126ade718312ed1ee971ff55150cd4b391c58de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48025/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48025/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48025/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/165652b1e6aa27d7019da15e21498541f1286b19","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-49537","ref":"SPARK-49537","sha":"165652b1e6aa27d7019da15e21498541f1286b19","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467759455,"node_id":"R_kgDOG-FxXw","name":"spark","full_name":"wangyum/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR enables RocksDB to read <zip, changelog> file watermarked with unique ids (e.g. `version_uniqueId.zip`, `version_uniqueId.changelog`). Below is a explanation on the changes and rationale.\r\n\r\nNow for each changelog file, we put a \"version: uniqueId\" to its first line, from it's current version to the previous snapshot version. For each snapshot (zip) file, there is no change other than their name (`version_uniqueId.zip`), because snapshot files are single source of truth.\r\n\r\nIn addition to LastCommitBasedCheckpointId, lastCommittedCheckpointId, loadedCheckpointId added in xxx, also add a in-memory map `versionToUniqueIdLineage` that maps version to unique Id. This is useful when you reuse the same rocksDB instance in the executor, so you don't need to load the lineage from the changelog file again.\r\n      \r\n## RocksDB:\r\n#### Load\r\n- When `loadedVersion != version`, try to load a changelog file with `version_checkpointUniqueId.changelog`. If the load fails, there could be multiple cases:\r\n    1. Version corresponds to a zip file:\r\n        1. `version_uniqueId.zip`, this means (either changelog was not enabled, or it was enabled but version happens to be a checkpoint file), and previously query run ckpt v2\r\n        2. `version.zip`, this means (either changelog was not enabled, or it was enabled but version happens to be a checkpoint file), and previously query run ckpt v1\r\n    2. Version corresponds to a changelog file:\r\n        1. `version_uniqueId.changelog`, this means changelog was enabled, and previously query run ckpt v2\r\n        2. `version.changelog`, this means changelog was enabled, and previously query run ckpt v1\r\n\r\nCase i.b and case ii.b will be addressed in a followup PR. For case i.a, we read the lineage file stored in `version_uniqueId.changelog`, for case ii.a, we construct a new empty lineage `(version, sessionCheckpointId)`. \r\n\r\nNext the code finds the latest snapshot version. When there are multiple snapshot files with the same version but different unique Id (main problem this project was trying to solve), the correct one will be loaded based on the checkpoint id.\r\n\r\nThen changelog is replayed with the awareness of lineage. The lineage is stored in memory for next load().\r\n\r\nLast, load the changelog writer for version + 1, and write the lineage (version + 1, sessionCheckpointId) to the first line of the file. While it seems that the lineage is written early, it is safe because the change log writer is not committed yet.\r\n\r\n- When `loadedVersion == version`, the same rocks db instance is reused and the lineage is stored in memory to `versionToUniqueIdLineage`.\r\n\r\n#### Commit\r\n- Also save `sessionCheckpointId` to `latestSnapshot`\r\n- Add `(newVersion, sessionCheckpointId)` to `versionToUniqueIdLineage`\r\n\r\n#### Abort\r\nAlso clear up `versionToUniqueIdLineage`\r\n\r\n\r\n## RocksDBFileManager:\r\n- A bunch of add-ups to make until code uniqueId aware.\r\n### deleteOldVersions: (need test)\r\nIf there are multiple `version_uniqueId1.zip`(changelog) and `versioion.uniqueId2.zip`, all are deleted.\r\n\r\n## Changelog Reader / Writer\r\nWe purpose to save the lineage to the first line of the changelog files.\r\nWe purpose to add a new field (`checkpointFormatVersion`) in the base abstract StateStoreChangelogWriter and StateStoreChangelogReader. \r\nFor changelog reader, there is an abstract function `readLineage` and a field `lineage` created. If the `checkpointFormatVersion = 2`, the reader will read the lineage during initialization, similar to how we added the \"version\" in V2 reader.\r\nFor changelog writer, there is an abstract function `writeLineage` that writes the lineage. This function will be called before any actual change log data is written.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPrevious [pull request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47973) introduced new logic for `LEAVE` and `ITERATE` statements, but I missed to introduce minor part of `ITERATE` statement handling.\r\nWhile `ITERATE` statement is not allowed for compounds (i.e. user cannot use `LEAVE <label>` where label belongs to compound) it's still possible to use `ITERATE` statement within the compound (i.e. when using label of the surrounding `WHILE` loop for example). In such cases, it's required to drop variables defined in the compound (the same way as for `ITERATE` statement).\r\nWe don't yet have execution logic (I will work on POC and design doc during the next week), but this is setting up stuff now, so we don't miss anything in future.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanges are minor, they improve consistency among test suites for SQL scripting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded small test, but not completely related to this change. Since we don't have execution logic yet, it's hard to test. I will add more tests together with the execution logic.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-07T05:48:19Z","updated_at":"2024-09-08T12:06:52Z","closed_at":"2024-09-08T12:06:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a203b096b7e9d5acdc67c966849dd8a097debe8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48022/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48022/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48022/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3487d99b8967272239ef6ae10ffacd3b192fec29","head":{"label":"davidm-db:missing_logic_for_leave_statement","ref":"missing_logic_for_leave_statement","sha":"3487d99b8967272239ef6ae10ffacd3b192fec29","user":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":775065390,"node_id":"R_kgDOLjKPLg","name":"spark","full_name":"davidm-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis introduces an implicit conversion for the Column companion object that allows a user/developer to create a Column from a catalyst Expression (for Classic) or a proto Expression (Builder) (for Connect). This mostly recreates they had before we refactored the Column API. This comes at the price of adding the an import.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImproved upgrade experience for Developers and User who create their own Column's from

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47772 . The behavior of SaveAsTable should not be changed by switching v1 to v2 command. This is similar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47995. For the case of `DelegatingCatalogExtension` we need it goes to V1 commands to be consistent with previous behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBehavior regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIntroduce four new command line arguments to spark-submit:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--yarn-docker-image\r\n--yarn-docker-mounts\r\n--executor-docker-image\r\n--executor-docker-mounts\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese arguments can be used to simplify the boilerplate code for using docker with YARN, such as: \r\n\r\n```sh\r\n--conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_TYPE=docker\r\n--conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_IMAGE=repo/image:tag\r\n--conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_MOUNTS=\"/etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro,/etc/hadoop:/etc/hadoop:ro\"\r\n--conf spark.executorEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_TYPE=docker\r\n--conf spark.executorEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_IMAGE=repo/image:tag\r\n--conf spark.executorEnv.YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_MOUNTS=\"/etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro,/etc/hadoop:/etc/hadoop:ro\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this change is [this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29474). It's important to have a more user friendly interface for using docker, instead of the boilerplate aforementioned, where spark/YARN configs for docker stay hidden behind a façade. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt adds the aforementioned command line arguments, that will be available on `spark-submit` and subsequently `spark-shell` once this PR is applied.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTests were added, where it is tested if the configs from the boilerplace are properly applied. It was also tested using Github actions.\r\n\r\nTo do: test these changes on a real YARN cluster. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPrevious [pull request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47973) introduced new tests to `SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite` (among others) where accidentally `parseScript` was used instead of `runSqlScript`.\r\nWhile the same exception would get thrown (since it happens in the parsing phase) it violates the consistency among the tests in this suite and adds unnecessary import, so it would be nice to change it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanges are minor, they improve consistency among test suites for SQL scripting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch alters tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-06T12:27:06Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T14:35:18Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T14:35:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8ba088c770636043ba398d908dd2a11fc438d2c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48016/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48016/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48016/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/edd128623843ac8c2a2e321224033311471eff24","head":{"label":"davidm-db:interpreter_test_suite_fix","ref":"interpreter_test_suite_fix","sha":"edd128623843ac8c2a2e321224033311471eff24","user":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":775065390,"node_id":"R_kgDOLjKPLg","name":"spark","full_name":"davidm-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr adds two new check condition sto the `launcher.AbstractCommandBuilder#buildClassPath` method:\r\n\r\nWhen `SPARK_PREPEND_CLASSES` is true, it no longer prepending the class path of the `sql/hive` module when `spark-hive_xxx.jar` is not in the classpath. The assumption here is that if `spark-hive_xxx.jar` is not in the classpath, then the `-Phive` profile was not used during package, and therefore the Hive-related jars（such as hive-exec-xx.jar） should also not be in the classpath. To avoid failure in loading the SPI in `DataSourceRegister` under `sql/hive`, so no longer prepend `sql/hive`. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, due to the strong dependency of `sql/hive-thriftserver` on `sql/hive`, the prepend for `sql/hive-thriftserver` will also be excluded if `spark-hive_xxx.jar` is not in the classpath. On the other hand, if `spark-hive-thriftserver_xxx.jar` is not in the classpath, then the `-Phive-thriftserver` profile was not used during package, and therefore, jars such as hive-cli and hive-beeline should also not be included in the classpath. To avoid the inelegant startup failures of tools such as spark-sql, in this scenario, `sql/hive-thriftserver` will no longer be prepended to the classpath.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix some bad cases during development,  one of them is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean package\r\nexport SPARK_PREPEND_CLASSES=true\r\nbin/spark-shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWelcome to\r\n

relevant jars are not present in the classpath. Therefore, the current pr opts to not prepend the classpath of `sql/hive` in this specific scenario.\r\n\r\nAnother one is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean package -Phive // or build/sbt clean package\r\nexport SPARK_PREPEND_CLASSES=true\r\nbin/spark-sql\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-sql          \r\nNOTE: SPARK_PREPEND_CLASSES is set, placing locally compiled Spark classes ahead of assembly.\r\nWARNING: Using incubator modules: jdk.incubator.vector\r\n24/09/09 00:28:26 ERROR SparkSubmit: Failed to load org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.SparkSQLCLIDriver\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/hive/cli/CliDriver\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:1017)\r\n\tat java.base/java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:150)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.defineClass(BuiltinClassLoader.java:862)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.findClassOnClassPathOrNull(BuiltinClassLoader.java:760)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.loadClassOrNull(BuiltinClassLoader.java:681)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.loadClass(BuiltinClassLoader.java:639)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders$AppClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoaders.java:188)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:579)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:525)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:467)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.SparkClassUtils.classForName(SparkClassUtils.scala:41)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.SparkClassUtils.classForName$(SparkClassUtils.scala:36)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.classForName(Utils.scala:99)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit.org$apache$spark$deploy$SparkSubmit$$runMain(SparkSubmit.scala:992)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit.doRunMain$1(SparkSubmit.scala:203)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit.submit(SparkSubmit.scala:226)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit.doSubmit(SparkSubmit.scala:100)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit$$anon$2.doSubmit(SparkSubmit.scala:1136)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit$.main(SparkSubmit.scala:1145)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit.main(SparkSubmit.scala)\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.CliDriver\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.loadClass(BuiltinClassLoader.java:641)\r\n\tat java.base/jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders$AppClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoaders.java:188)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:525)\r\n\t... 22 more\r\nFailed to load hive class.\r\nYou need to build Spark with -Phive and -Phive-thriftserver.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned failure occurred because, when compiling without the `-Phive` and `-Phive-thriftserver` profiles, the classpath lacked the necessary dependencies related to hive-cli. Therefore, in this scenario, `sql/hive-thriftserver` should not be prepended to the classpath either.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo，this is only for developers\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Pass GitHub Actions\r\n2. Manually verify that the aforementioned test scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe first scenario no longer reports errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____              __\r\n     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__\r\n    _\\ \\/ _ \\/ _ `/ __/  '_/\r\n   /___/ .__/\\_,_/_/ /_/\\_\\   version 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n      /_/\r\n         \r\nUsing Scala version 2.13.14 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 17.0.12)\r\nType in expressions to have them evaluated.\r\nType :help for more information.\r\n24/09/06 17:45:24 WARN NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable\r\n24/09/06 17:45:24 WARN Utils: Service 'SparkUI' could not bind on port 4040.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport line plot with plotly backend on both Spark Connect and Spark classic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile Pandas on Spark supports plotting, PySpark currently lacks this feature. The proposed API will enable users to generate visualizations, such as line plots, by leveraging libraries like Plotly. This will provide users with an intuitive, interactive way to explore and understand large datasets directly from PySpark DataFrames, streamlining the data analysis workflow in distributed environments.\r\n\r\nSee more at [PySpark Plotting API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjOEzC8zcetG86WDvqkereQPj_NGLNW7Bdu910g30Dg/edit?usp=sharing) in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request introduces changes to the default value of the `ivySettings` parameter in the `IvyTestUtils#withRepository` function. During the construction of the `IvySettings` object, the configurations of `DefaultIvyUserDir` and `DefaultCache` within the instance are modified through an additional call to the `MavenUtils.processIvyPathArg` function:\r\n\r\n1. The `DefaultIvyUserDir` is set to `${user.home}/.ivy2.5.2`.\r\n2. The `DefaultCache` is set to the `cache` directory under the modified `IvyUserDir`. By default, the `cache` directory is `${user.home}/.ivy2/cache`.\r\n\r\nThese alterations are made to address a Badcase in the testing process.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to allow `IvyTestUtils` to invoke the `MavenUtils.processIvyPathArg` function, the visibility of the `processIvyPathArg` function has been adjusted from `private` to `private[util]`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix a Badcase in the testing, the reproduction steps are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Clean up files and directories related to `mylib-0.1.jar` under `~/.ivy2.5.2`\r\n2.

aforementioned bad case are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Following https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45075, to address compatibility issues, Spark 4.0 adopted `~/.ivy2.5.2` as the default Ivy user directory. When tests are executed with Java 21, the compiled `mylib-0.1.jar` is published to the directory `~/.ivy2.5.2/cache/my.great.lib/mylib/jars`.\r\n\r\n2. However, the `getDefaultCache` method within the default `IvySettings` instance still returns `~/.ivy2/cache`. Consequently, when the `purgeLocalIvyCache` function is called within the `withRepository` function, it attempts to clean the `artifact` and `deps` directories under `~/.ivy2/cache`. This results in the failure to effectively clean up the `mylib-0.1.jar` file located at `~/.ivy2.5.2/cache/my.great.lib/mylib/jars`, which was originally published by Java 21. Subsequently, when tests are executed with Java 17 and attempt to load this Java 21-compiled `mylib-0.1.jar`, the tests fail.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9269a0bfed56429e999269dfdfd89aefcb1b7261/common/utils/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/util/IvyTestUtils.scala#L361-L371\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9269a0bfed56429e999269dfdfd89aefcb1b7261/common/utils/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/util/IvyTestUtils.scala#L392-L403\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, the pull request modifies the default configuration of the `IvySettings` instance, ensuring that `purgeLocalIvyCache` is able to properly clean up the corresponding cache files located in `~/.ivy2.5.2/cache`. This resolution fixes the aforementioned problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Pass GitHub Actions\r\n2. Manually executing the tests described in the pull request results in success, and it is confirmed that the `~/.ivy2.5.2/cache/my.great.lib` directory is cleaned up promptly.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNO\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-06T02:44:56Z","updated_at":"2024-09-08T14:39:22Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T14:23:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d54a622e2c41cff5c2358ed40eee9f97f78f7936","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/66b7479a5e7f84b5c0586753049ee46b24243b17","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:IvyTestUtils-withRepository","ref":"IvyTestUtils-withRepository","sha":"66b7479a5e7f84b5c0586753049ee46b24243b17","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds support for users to provide a Dataframe that can be used to instantiate state for the query in the first batch for arbitrary state API v2 in Python.\r\nThe Scala PR for supporting initial state is here: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45467\r\n\r\nWe propose to create a new PythonRunner that handles initial state specifically for TransformWithStateInPandas. From JVM, we coGroup input rows and initial state rows on the same grouping key. Then we create a new row that contains one row in the input rows iterator and one row in the initial state iterator, and send the new grouped row to Py4j. Inside the python worker, we deserialize the grouped row into input rows and initial state rows separately and input those into `handleInitialState` and `handleInputRows`.\r\nWe will launch a python worker for each partition that has a non-empty input rows in either input rows or initial states. This will guarantee all keys in the initial state will be processed even if they do not appear in the first batch or they don't lie in the same partition with keys in the first batch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe need to couple the API as we support initial state handling in Scala.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nThis PR introduces a new API in the `StatefulProcessor` which allows users to define their own udf for processing initial state:\r\n```\r\n def handleInitialState(\r\n        self, key: Any, initialState: \"PandasDataFrameLike\"\r\n    ) -> None:\r\n```\r\nThe implementation of this function is optional. If not defined, then it will act as no-op.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests & integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-05T23:15:56Z","updated_at":"2024-11-06T01:51:34Z","closed_at":"2024-11-06T01:51:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59ab3c814bbce6101c1a544f38da5dedb5241b46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new SQL functions \"randstr\" and \"uniform\" to generate random strings or numbers within ranges.\r\n\r\n* The \"randstr\" function returns a string of the specified length whose characters are chosen uniformly at random from the following pool of characters: 0-9, a-z, A-Z. The random seed is optional. The string length must be a constant two-byte or four-byte integer (SMALLINT or INT, respectively).\r\n* The \"uniform\" function returns a random value with independent and identically distributed  values with the specified range of numbers. The random seed is optional. The provided numbers specifying the minimum and maximum values of the range must be constant. If both of these numbers are integers, then the result will also be an integer. Otherwise if one or both of these are floating-point numbers, then the result will also be a floating-point number.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT randstr(5);\r\n> ceV0P\r\n\r\nSELECT randstr(10, 0) FROM VALUES (0), (1), (2) tab(col);\r\n> ceV0PXaR2I\r\n  fYxVfArnv7\r\n  iSIv0VT2XL\r\n\r\nSELECT uniform(10, 20.0F);\r\n> 17.604954\r\n\r\nSELECT uniform(10, 20, 0) FROM VALUES (0), (1), (2) tab(col);\r\n> 15\r\n  16\r\n  17\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves the SQL functionality of Apache Spark and improves its parity with other systems:\r\n*

https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/randstr\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds golden file based test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNot this time.","created_at":"2024-09-05T22:46:11Z","updated_at":"2024-09-17T13:23:25Z","closed_at":"2024-09-17T12:47:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"623ae9e92047678ec9fbb4eefb7addd81e81be35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48004/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48004/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48004/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6881f9b359c6053f5aa321aacb6cc04ca7a5234e","head":{"label":"dtenedor:uniform-randstr-functions","ref":"uniform-randstr-functions","sha":"6881f9b359c6053f5aa321aacb6cc04ca7a5234e","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the `ArtifactManager`, the `remoteRelativePath` is normalized to replace both frontslashes(`/`, posix style) and backslashes(`\\`, windows style) to `File.separator` which chooses the correct separator based on the system the server is running in.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe change is required to support cross-environment compatibility between client and server. For example, Windows-based Python client users are forced to set `os.path = posixpath` to have the client send artifact paths in POSIX style. \r\n\r\nWithout the above workaround, if the client were to send an artifact with the name `pyfiles\\abc.txt` to the posix-based server, then the artifact would be written out as `<aritfact_directory>/pyfiles\\abc.txt` (where `pyfiles\\abc.txt` is the file name) instead of the correct `<artifact_directory>/pyfiles/abc.txt` (where `abc.txt` is the filename)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it fixes a bug for Windows-based clients.\r\n\r\nExample, python client users were forced to use the following as a workaround:\r\n```python\r\nimport posixpath\r\n\r\n# Backup the original os.path module to restore later\r\noriginal_os_path = os.path\r\n\r\n# Temporarily replace os.path with posixpath to ensure POSIX-compatible path handling\r\n# This is necessary on Windows to work with POSIX-style paths expected by Spark\r\nos.path = posixpath\r\n\r\nspark.addArtifact(\"./dummy_file.py\", pyfile=True)\r\n\r\n# Restore the original os.path module after the operation\r\nos.path = original_os_path\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew usage:\r\n```python\r\nspark.addArtifact(\".\\dummy_file.py\", pyfile=True)\r\n```\r\nA posix-based server would automatically handle the above windows-based path.\r\n \r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-09-05T21:25:06Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T01:29:01Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T01:29:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a47c3e2c10efbc1b17c0f96dc32819f5d183565c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48003/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48003/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48003/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d5185dcde9e7a4a5899d38d25a883124ac54f5a","head":{"label":"vicennial:SPARK-49526","ref":"SPARK-49526","sha":"7d5185dcde9e7a4a5899d38d25a883124ac54f5a","user":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402021456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDIwMjE0NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"vicennial/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange the log of onQueryStarted and onQueryTerminated from `logDebug` to `logInfo`. They would be useful for debugging as they indicate the events are indeed being fired from the server. It won't add more logging burden as there won't be so many queries start / end, at least much less than `onQueryProgress`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNo need\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

In `resource-managers/kubernetes/core/pom.xml` and `resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/pom.xml`, the `build-helper-maven-plugin` configuration has been added for the `volcano` profile to ensure that when the profile is activated with `-Pvolcano`, the `volcano/src/main/scala` directory is treated as an additional source path, and `volcano/src/test/scala` directory is treated as an additional test code path.\r\n\r\n\r\n- `resource-managers/kubernetes/core/pom.xml`\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n      <build>\r\n        <plugins>\r\n          <plugin>\r\n            <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>build-helper-maven-plugin</artifactId>\r\n            <executions>\r\n              <execution>\r\n                <id>add-volcano-source</id>\r\n                <phase>generate-sources</phase>\r\n                <goals>\r\n                  <goal>add-source</goal>\r\n                </goals>\r\n                <configuration>\r\n                  <sources>\r\n                    <source>volcano/src/main/scala</source>\r\n                  </sources>\r\n                </configuration>\r\n              </execution>\r\n              <execution>\r\n                <id>add-volcano-test-sources</id>\r\n                <phase>generate-test-sources</phase>\r\n                <goals>\r\n                  <goal>add-test-source</goal>\r\n                </goals>\r\n                <configuration>\r\n                  <sources>\r\n                    <source>volcano/src/test/scala</source>\r\n                  </sources>\r\n                </configuration>\r\n              </execution>\r\n            </executions>\r\n          </plugin>\r\n        </plugins>\r\n      </build>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/pom.xml`\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n      <build>\r\n        <plugins>\r\n          <plugin>\r\n            <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>build-helper-maven-plugin</artifactId>\r\n            <executions>\r\n              <execution>\r\n                <id>add-volcano-test-sources</id>\r\n                <phase>generate-test-sources</phase>\r\n                <goals>\r\n                  <goal>add-test-source</goal>\r\n                </goals>\r\n                <configuration>\r\n                  <sources>\r\n                    <source>volcano/src/test/scala</source>\r\n                  </sources>\r\n                </configuration>\r\n              </execution>\r\n            </executions>\r\n          </plugin>\r\n        </plugins>\r\n      </build>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Removed the management configuration for `volcano`-related source/test code in SPARK-36061 | https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35422.\r\n\r\nSince Spark uses the `sbt-pom-reader` plugin in its sbt configuration, the behavior of the `build-helper-maven-plugin` will also propagate to the sbt build process. Therefore, no additional configuration is required in `SparkBuild.scala` after this pr.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe previous configuration way was not very friendly to IntelliJ developers: when debugging code in IntelliJ, regardless of whether they were needed or not, the `volcano` profile had to be activated; otherwise compilation errors would occur when running tests that depended on the `kubernetes` module's source code, for example `org.apache.spark.shuffle.ShuffleChecksumUtilsSuite` :\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1465\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e16e3eba-d85e-45ad-bbae-533bd2f8ce0b\">\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1.

Manual Testing Using sbt\r\n\r\n- Run `build/sbt clean \"kubernetes/testOnly *VolcanoFeatureStepSuite\" -Pkubernetes`, and without `-Pvolcano`, no tests will be executed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Passed: Total 0, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 0\r\n[info] No tests to run for kubernetes / Test / testOnly\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Run `build/sbt clean \"kubernetes/testOnly *VolcanoFeatureStepSuite\" -Pkubernetes -Pvolcano`, and with `-Pvolcano`, `VolcanoFeatureStepSuite` will pass the tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] VolcanoFeatureStepSuite:\r\n[info] - SPARK-36061: Driver Pod with Volcano PodGroup (74 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - SPARK-36061: Executor Pod with Volcano PodGroup (8 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - SPARK-38455: Support driver podgroup template (224 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - SPARK-38503: return empty for executor pre resource (1 millisecond)\r\n[info] Run completed in 1 second, 268 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 4\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 4, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- run `build/sbt clean  \"kubernetes/package\" -Pkubernetes -Pvolcano`, and with `-Pvolcano`, confirm that `spark-kubernetes_2.13-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` contains `VolcanoFeatureStep.class`\r\n\r\n- run `build/sbt clean  \"kubernetes/package\" -Pkubernetes`, and without `-Pvolcano`, confirm that `spark-kubernetes_2.13-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` not contains `VolcanoFeatureStep.class`\r\n\r\n3. Manual Testing Using Maven\r\n\r\n- Run `build/mvn clean test -pl resource-managers/kubernetes/core -am -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.deploy.k8s.features.VolcanoFeatureStepSuite -Pkubernetes`, and without `-Pvolcano`, no tests will be executed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDiscovery starting.\r\nDiscovery completed in 80 milliseconds.\r\nRun starting.

Expected test count is: 4\r\nVolcanoFeatureStepSuite:\r\n- SPARK-36061: Driver Pod with Volcano PodGroup\r\n- SPARK-36061: Executor Pod with Volcano PodGroup\r\n- SPARK-38455: Support driver podgroup template\r\n- SPARK-38503: return empty for executor pre resource\r\nRun completed in 624 milliseconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 4\r\nSuites: completed 2, aborted 0\r\nTests: succeeded 4, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\nAll tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- run `build/mvn clean package -pl resource-managers/kubernetes/core -am -DskipTests -Pkubernetes -Pvolcano` and with `-Pvolcano`, confirm that `spark-kubernetes_2.13-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` contains `VolcanoFeatureStep.class`\r\n\r\n- run `build/mvn clean package -pl resource-managers/kubernetes/core -am -DskipTests -Pkubernetes` and without `-Pvolcano`, confirm that `spark-kubernetes_2.13-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` not contains `VolcanoFeatureStep.class`\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Testing in IntelliJ (both imported as a Maven project and as an sbt project):\r\n- By default, do not activate `volcano`, and confirm that `volcano`-related code is not recognized as source/test code, and does not affect the compilation and testing of other code.\r\n- Manually activate `volcano`, and confirm that `volcano`-related code is recognized as source/test code, and can be compiled and tested normally.\r\n\r\n5. Similar tests were conducted on `kubernetes-integration-tests` module to confirm the validity of the `volcano` profile.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMerge the options of both `DataSourceV2Relation` and `FileTable` when constructing `FileScanBuilder`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the subclass of `FileTable` only uses the options from relation when constructing the `FileScanBuilder`, which leads to the omission of the contents in `FileTable.options`. For the `TableCatalog`, the `dsOptions` can be set into the `FileTable.options` returned by the `TableCatalog.loadTable` method. If only the relation options are used here, the `TableCatalog` will not be able to pass `dsOptions` that contains table options to `FileScan`.\r\n\r\nMerge the two options is a better option.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-05T03:13:32Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T01:10:24Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T14:42:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d67921c9f475fc904c966fc085db6e14c76e35c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47996/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47996/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47996/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d2f26a46ca341438b20e309236d29ec0031b95cf","head":{"label":"liujiayi771:csv-options","ref":"csv-options","sha":"d2f26a46ca341438b20e309236d29ec0031b95cf","user":{"login":"liujiayi771","id":13622031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjIyMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13622031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771","html_url":"https://github.com/liujiayi771","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88181374,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODE4MTM3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"liujiayi771/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liujiayi771","id":13622031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjIyMDMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13622031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771","html_url":"https://github.com/liujiayi771","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liujiayi771/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liujiayi771/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47660 . If users override `spark_catalog` with\r\n`DelegatingCatalogExtension`, we should still use v1 commands as `DelegatingCatalogExtension` forwards requests to HMS and there are still behavior differences between v1 and v2 commands targeting HMS.\r\n\r\nThis PR also forces to use v1 commands for certain commands that do not have a v2 version.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid introducing behavior changes to Spark plugins that implements `DelegatingCatalogExtension` to override `spark_catalog`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test case\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update K8s docs to recommend K8s v1.28+ for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n- As of now (2024-09-04), v1.28, v1.29, v1.30, and v1.31 are available.\r\n\r\nThis is a kind of follow-up of the following previous PR because Apache Spark 4.0.0 schedule is delayed slightly.\r\n- #46168\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n**1. K8s community archived v1.27.19 on 2024-07-16 and starts to release v1.31.0 from 2024-08-13**\r\n- https://kubernetes.io/releases/#release-v1-31\r\n- https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/#non-active-branch-history\r\n\r\n**2. Default K8s Versions in Public Cloud environments**\r\n\r\nThe default K8s versions of public cloud providers are already moving to K8s 1.30 like the following.\r\n\r\n- EKS: v1.30 (Default)\r\n- GKE: v1.30 (Rapid),  v1.29 (Regular), v1.29 (Stable)\r\n- AKS: v1.29 (Default), v1.30 (Support)\r\n\r\n**3. End Of Support**\r\n\r\nIn addition, K8s 1.27 reached or will reach a standard support EOL in two weeks before Apache Spark 4.0.0 release. \r\n\r\n| K8s  |   EKS   |  AKS  |   GKE   |\r\n| ---- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| 1.27 | 2024-07 | 2024-07 | 2024-09-16 |\r\n\r\n- [EKS EOL Schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html#kubernetes-release-calendar)\r\n- [AKS EOL Schedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar)\r\n- [GKE EOL Schedule](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-schedule)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n- No, this is a documentation-only change about K8s versions.\r\n- Apache Spark K8s Integration Test is currently using K8s **v1.30.0** on Minikube already.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-04T17:10:31Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T01:41:53Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T00:14:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9792cc85b421754959b8f07f80ce3c6cd585c12b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bfb51869091922ab434a473a53f977c1f209eb9b","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-49512","ref":"SPARK-49512","sha":"bfb51869091922ab434a473a53f977c1f209eb9b","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main changes in this pr are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. In `core/pom.xml`, the `build-helper-maven-plugin` configuration has been added for the `opentelemetry` profile to ensure that when the profile is activated with `-Popentelemetry`, the `opentelemetry/src/main/scala` directory under the `core` module is treated as an additional source path, and `opentelemetry/src/test/scala` is treated as an additional test code path.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<build>\r\n    <plugins>\r\n      <plugin>\r\n        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>build-helper-maven-plugin</artifactId>\r\n        <executions>\r\n          <execution>\r\n            <id>add-opentelemetry-source</id>\r\n            <phase>generate-sources</phase>\r\n            <goals>\r\n              <goal>add-source</goal>\r\n            </goals>\r\n            <configuration>\r\n              <sources>\r\n                <source>opentelemetry/src/main/scala</source>\r\n              </sources>\r\n            </configuration>\r\n          </execution>\r\n          <execution>\r\n            <id>add-opentelemetry-test-sources</id>\r\n            <phase>generate-test-sources</phase>\r\n            <goals>\r\n              <goal>add-test-source</goal>\r\n            </goals>\r\n            <configuration>\r\n              <sources>\r\n                <source>opentelemetry/src/test/scala</source>\r\n              </sources>\r\n            </configuration>\r\n          </execution>\r\n        </executions>\r\n      </plugin>\r\n    </plugins>\r\n  </build>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Removed the management configuration for `opentelemetry`-related source/test code in `https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47763`.\r\n\r\nSince Spark uses the `sbt-pom-reader` plugin in its sbt configuration, the behavior of the `build-helper-maven-plugin` will also propagate to the sbt build process. Therefore, no additional configuration is required in `SparkBuild.scala` after this pr.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe previous configuration way was not very friendly to IntelliJ developers: when debugging code in IntelliJ, regardless of whether they were needed or not, the `opentelemetry` profile had to be activated; otherwise compilation errors would occur when running tests that depended on the core module's source code, for example `DataSourceV2SQLSuiteV2Filter `:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e80f71cd-d189-4de1-ace4-b18e5011a7bb\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Pass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/actions/runs/10697633945/job/29663999051\r\n\r\n<img width=\"734\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f40113-0ee7-43d5-aff8-f627efec263b\">\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that the test cases `OpenTelemetryPushReporterSuite ` and `OpenTelemetryPushSinkSuite` have been successfully executed.\r\n\r\n2. Manual Testing Using sbt\r\n\r\n- Run `build/sbt \"core/testOnly *OpenTelemetryPushReporterSuite *OpenTelemetryPushSinkSuite\"`, and without `-Popentelemetry`, no tests will be executed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Passed: Total 0, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 0\r\n[info] No tests to run for core / Test / testOnly\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Run `build/sbt \"core/testOnly *OpenTelemetryPushReporterSuite *OpenTelemetryPushSinkSuite\" -Popentelemetry`, and with `-Popentelemetry`, `OpenTelemetryPushReporterSuite` and `OpenTelemetryPushSinkSuite` will pass the tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] OpenTelemetryPushReporterSuite:\r\n[info] - Normalize metric name key (10 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale gauge is added (5 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale counter is added (2 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale histogram is added (4 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale meter is added (1 millisecond)\r\n[info] - OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale timer is added (1 millisecond)\r\n[info] OpenTelemetryPushSinkSuite:\r\n[info] - fetch properties map (2 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - OpenTelemetry sink with one counter added (3 milliseconds)\r\n[info] Run completed in 713 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 8\r\n[info] Suites: completed 2, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 8, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Manual Testing Using Maven\r\n\r\n- Run `build/mvn clean test -pl core -am -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.opentelemetry.OpenTelemetryPushReporterSuite,org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.opentelemetry.OpenTelemetryPushSinkSuite`, and without `-Popentelemetry`, no tests will be executed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDiscovery starting.\r\nDiscovery completed in 764 milliseconds.\r\nRun starting. Expected test count is: 0\r\nDiscoverySuite:\r\nDiscoverySuite:\r\nRun completed in 779 milliseconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 0\r\nSuites: completed 2, aborted 0\r\nTests: succeeded 0, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\nNo tests were executed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Run `build/mvn clean test -pl core -am -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.opentelemetry.OpenTelemetryPushReporterSuite,org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.opentelemetry.OpenTelemetryPushSinkSuite -Popentelemetry`, and with `-Popentelemetry`, `OpenTelemetryPushReporterSuite` and `OpenTelemetryPushSinkSuite` will pass the tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDiscovery starting.\r\nDiscovery completed in 1 second, 33 milliseconds.\r\nRun starting. Expected test count is: 8\r\nOpenTelemetryPushReporterSuite:\r\n- Normalize metric name key\r\n- OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale gauge is added\r\n- OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale counter is added\r\n- OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale histogram is added\r\n- OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale meter is added\r\n- OpenTelemetry actions when one codahale timer is added\r\nOpenTelemetryPushSinkSuite:\r\n- fetch properties map\r\n- OpenTelemetry sink with one counter added\r\nRun completed in 1 second, 142 milliseconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 8\r\nSuites: completed 4, aborted 0\r\nTests: succeeded 8, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\nAll tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Testing in IntelliJ (both imported as a Maven project and as an sbt project):\r\n- By default, do not activate `opentelemetry`, and confirm that `opentelemetry`-related code is not recognized as source/test code, and does not affect the compilation and testing of other code.\r\n- Manually activate `opentelemetry`, and confirm that `opentelemetry`-related code is recognized as source/test code, and can be compiled and tested normally.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- optimize `ArrayBinarySearch` for `foldable` array.\r\n- fix a bug in the original implementation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes improve performance of the `array_binary_search()` function.\r\n- create an instance of `foldable{DataType}ArrayData` only once at the initialization ( avoid frequent calls to `ArrayData.to{DataType}Array()` ), and reuse it inside of `replacement` in the case when the `array` parameter is foldable.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nRunning benchmark: array binary

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `Dataset#toJSON`, use the schema from `exprEnc`. This schema reflects any changes (e.g., decimal precision, column ordering) that `exprEnc` might make to input rows.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`Dataset#toJSON` currently uses the schema from the logical plan, but that schema does not necessarily describe the rows passed to `JacksonGenerator`: the function passed to `mapPartitions` uses `exprEnc` to serialize the input, and this could potentially change the precision on decimals or rearrange columns.\r\n\r\nHere's an example that tricks `UnsafeRow#getDecimal` (called from `JacksonGenerator`) to mistakenly assume the decimal is stored as a Long:\r\n```\r\nscala> case class Data(a: BigDecimal)\r\nclass Data\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select 123.456bd as a\").as[Data].toJSON.collect\r\nwarning: 1 deprecation (since 2.13.3); for details, enable `:setting -deprecation` or `:replay -deprecation`\r\nval res0: Array[String] = Array({\"a\":68719476.745})\r\n\r\nscala>\r\n```\r\nHere's an example that tricks `JacksonGenerator` to ask for a string from an array and an array from a string. This case actually crashes the JVM:\r\n```\r\nscala> case class Data(x: Array[Int], y: String)\r\nclass Data\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select repeat('Hey there', 17) as y, array_repeat(22, 17) as x\").as[Data].toJSON.collect\r\nwarning: 1 deprecation (since 2.13.3); for details, enable `:setting -deprecation` or `:replay -deprecation`\r\nException in task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0)\r\njava.lang.InternalError: a fault occurred in a recent unsafe memory access operation in compiled Java code\r\n\tat

the PR, converting the dataframe to a dataset of Tuple would preserve the column names in the JSON strings:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"select 123.456d as a, 12 as b\").as[(Double, Int)].toJSON.collect\r\nwarning: 1 deprecation (since 2.13.3); for details, enable `:setting -deprecation` or `:replay -deprecation`\r\nval res0: Array[String] = Array({\"a\":123.456,\"b\":12})\r\n\r\nscala> \r\n```\r\nAfter the PR, the JSON strings use the field name from the Tuple class:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"select 123.456d as a, 12 as b\").as[(Double, Int)].toJSON.collect\r\nwarning: 1 deprecation (since 2.13.3); for details, enable `:setting -deprecation` or `:replay -deprecation`\r\nval res1: Array[String] = Array({\"_1\":123.456,\"_2\":12})\r\n\r\nscala> \r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-03T23:10:02Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T15:35:21Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T04:43:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50656cc56b14c1e332a88e64b886888a4346fc38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b41eb3531b99ced1cb4a0ddcfd103c793f1ce884","head":{"label":"bersprockets:to_json_issue","ref":"to_json_issue","sha":"b41eb3531b99ced1cb4a0ddcfd103c793f1ce884","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for state data source reader and list state\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change adds support for reading state written using list state used primarily within the stateful processor used with the `transformWithState` operator\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nUsers can read state and `explode` entries using the following query:\r\n```\r\n        val stateReaderDf = spark.read\r\n          .format(\"statestore\")\r\n          .option(StateSourceOptions.PATH, <checkpoint_location>)\r\n          .option(StateSourceOptions.STATE_VAR_NAME, <state_var_name>)\r\n          .load()\r\n\r\n        val listStateDf = stateReaderDf\r\n          .selectExpr(\r\n            \"key.value AS groupingKey\",\r\n            \"list_value AS valueList\",\r\n            \"partition_id\")\r\n          .select($\"groupingKey\",\r\n            explode($\"valueList\").as(\"valueList\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 1 minute, 3 seconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 8\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0\r\n[info] Tests: succeeded 8, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\n[info] All tests passed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-03T19:25:21Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T17:45:43Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T08:01:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea6204f4a808b87761eca02117320b620c128ae4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47978/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47978/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47978/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a23489aee69eb41cc72eb4cd24b940eec1ea724c","head":{"label":"anishshri-db:task/SPARK-49467","ref":"task/SPARK-49467","sha":"a23489aee69eb41cc72eb4cd24b940eec1ea724c","user":{"login":"anishshri-db","id":100322362,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfrMOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100322362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db","html_url":"https://github.com/anishshri-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":477925242,"node_id":"R_kgDOHHyPeg","name":"spark","full_name":"anishshri-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anishshri-db","id":100322362,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfrMOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100322362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db","html_url":"https://github.com/anishshri-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anishshri-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anishshri-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange the implementation of `createTable` to avoid escaping of special chars in `UnresolvedTableSpec.location`. This field should contain the original user-provided `path` option and not the URI that is constructed by the `buildStorageFormatFromOptions()` call.\r\n\r\nIn addition this commit extends `SparkFunSuite` and `SQLTestUtils` to allow creating temporary directories with a custom prefix. This can be used to create temporary directories with special chars.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBug fix. The following code would result in the creation of a table that is stored in `/tmp/test%table` instead of `/tmp/test table`:\r\n```\r\nspark.catalog.createTable(\"testTable\", source = \"parquet\", schema = new StructType().add(\"id\", \"int\"), description = \"\", options = Map(\"path\" -> \"/tmp/test table\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this was not consistent with the SQL API, e.g. `create table testTable(id int) using parquet location '/tmp/test table'`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The previous behaviour would result in table path be escaped. After this change the path will not be escaped.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing test in `CatalogSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-03T14:25:18Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T09:20:43Z","closed_at":"2024-09-09T09:20:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32d1564cc52c7b7e59c3d554791115d5c6295be5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/61c83d176e9ef3bdd8532022a079909920f68c32","head":{"label":"cstavr:location-double-escaping","ref":"location-double-escaping","sha":"61c83d176e9ef3bdd8532022a079909920f68c32","user":{"login":"cstavr","id":548423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODQyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr","html_url":"https://github.com/cstavr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":851607158,"node_id":"R_kgDOMsJ-dg","name":"spark","full_name":"cstavr/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cstavr","id":548423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODQyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr","html_url":"https://github.com/cstavr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cstavr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cstavr/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes introduction of `LEAVE` and `ITERATE` statement types to SQL Scripting language:\r\n- `LEAVE` statement can be used in loops, as well as in `BEGIN ... END` compound blocks.\r\n- `ITERATE` statement can be used only in loops.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces:\r\n- Logical operators for both statement types.\r\n- Execution nodes for both statement types.\r\n- Interpreter changes required to build execution plans that support new statement types.\r\n- New error if statements are not used properly.\r\n- Minor changes required to support new keywords.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdding support for new statement types to SQL Scripting language.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis PR introduces new statement types that will be available to users. However, script execution logic hasn't been done yet, so the new changes are not accessible by users yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests are introduced to all test suites related to SQL scripting.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-03T10:36:22Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T12:59:23Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T12:59:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a166e948aa05bba61214df0f30813afd7bee2076","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ca986325dcca7ca5e0bbd712c9650e29f22dc9cf","head":{"label":"davidm-db:sql_scripting_leave_iterate","ref":"sql_scripting_leave_iterate","sha":"ca986325dcca7ca5e0bbd712c9650e29f22dc9cf","user":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":775065390,"node_id":"R_kgDOLjKPLg","name":"spark","full_name":"davidm-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to have the dedicated environment variable called `SPARKR_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATION_WARNING` to skip SparkR deprecation warning.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to recover SparkR build on Windows (https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_sparkr_window.yml). Previously we did not set `SPARK_TESTING` before. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47881 set it and the build it broken. This PR works around it by having a dedicated environment variable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-03T09:02:11Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T21:34:59Z","closed_at":"2024-09-03T10:02:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87e1a8a167ead0ba35e4baf99261d629151a9e1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47972/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47972/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47972/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06ad875e49ca439408584a8666cd464572286db2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-49347-followup2","ref":"SPARK-49347-followup2","sha":"06ad875e49ca439408584a8666cd464572286db2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a cherry-pick of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47796.\r\n\r\nThe `xpath` expression incorrectly marks its return type as array of non-null strings. However, it can actually return an array containing nulls. This can cause NPE in code generation, such as query `select coalesce(xpath(repeat('<a></a>', id), 'a')[0], '') from range(1, 2)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt avoids potential failures in queries that uses the `xpath` expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to replace `Timer` with single thread scheduled executor for `ConsoleProgressBar`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe javadoc recommends `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` instead of `Timer`.\r\n![屏幕快照 2024-01-12 下午12 47 57](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/8486025/4fc5ed61-6bb9-4768-915a-ad919a067d04)\r\n\r\nThis change based on the following two points.\r\n**System time sensitivity**\r\n\r\nTimer scheduling is based on the absolute time of the operating system and is sensitive to the operating system's time. Once the operating system's time changes, Timer scheduling is no longer precise.\r\nThe scheduled Thread Pool Executor scheduling is based on relative time and is not affected by changes in operating system time.\r\n\r\n**Are anomalies captured**\r\n\r\nTimer does not capture exceptions thrown by Timer Tasks, and in addition, Timer is single threaded. Once a scheduling task encounters an exception, the entire thread will terminate and other tasks that need to be scheduled will no longer be executed.\r\nThe scheduled Thread Pool Executor implements scheduling functions based on a thread pool. After a task throws an exception, other tasks can still execute normally.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n'No'.","created_at":"2024-09-02T13:42:48Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T00:24:14Z","closed_at":"2025-01-28T00:24:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a2c6d8cdb78426aa40aec403c5da3cf359b25c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUse daemon `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` instead of non-daemon one as timer for `BarrierCoordinator`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn Barrier Execution Mode, Spark driver JVM could hang around after calling `spark.stop()`. Although the Spark Context was shutdown, the JVM was still running. The reason was that there is a non-daemon timer thread named `BarrierCoordinator barrier epoch increment timer`, which prevented the driver JVM from stopping.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManual test.\r\n\r\nRun [barrier_example.py](https://gist.github.com/jshmchenxi/5d7e7c61e1eedd03cd6d676699059e9b#file-barrier_example-py) script locally using `./bin/spark-submit barrier_example.py`. Without this change, the JVM would hang there and not exit. With this change it would exit successuflly.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCheck the status of the ExecutionHolder before reattaching it to the client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAn ExecutionHolder may fail to spawn an ExecuteThreadRunner if an exception is thrown before doing so. In that case, reattaching the ExecutionHolder will succeed but no progress will be made.\r\n-> *As a result, the job is hanging.*\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a test case to ReattachableExecuteSuite.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDo not include empty partitions for skew join calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark currently includes empty partitions while calculating the median size for the skew join optimization, which does not truly represent the data distribution required for skew optimization. This makes the median inaccurate if too many empty partitions are present median will represent a small value or even 0.\r\n\r\nSpark also uses empty partitions while calculating target size for skewed partitions. It considers empty partitions as non-skewed partitions and affects the average size of non-skewed partitions required for target size calculation.\r\n```\r\nval nonSkewSizes = sizes.filter(_ <= skewThreshold)\r\nval targetSize = max(nonSkewSizes.sum / nonSkewSizes.length, advisorySize)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample from AdaptiveQueryExecSuite –\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.range(0, 1000, 1, 10).selectExpr(\"id % 3 as key1\", \"id as value1\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"skewData1\")\r\nspark.range(0, 1000, 1, 10).selectExpr(\"id % 1 as key2\", \"id as value2\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"skewData2\")\r\n\r\n\"SELECT key1 FROM skewData1 JOIN skewData2 ON key1 = key2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the left side has only 3 non empty equal size partitions and right side has only 1 non empty partition. And even though they are not skewed in size, spark considers them skew and splits them. Which is wrong behaviour.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptimizeSkewedJoin: Left side partition 5 (3 KB) is skewed, split it into 5 parts.\r\nOptimizeSkewedJoin: Left side partition 28 (4 KB) is skewed, split it into 5 parts.\r\nOptimizeSkewedJoin: Left side partition 69 (4 KB) is skewed, split it into 5 parts.\r\nOptimizeSkewedJoin: Right side partition 5 (11 KB) is skewed, split it into 10 parts.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why
