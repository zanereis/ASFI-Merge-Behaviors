Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the `MXPredReshape` implementation in the c_predict_api. \r\nIn https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9984, `aux_arrays`, `sym`, and `ctx` members were introduced in `struct MXAPIPredictor` but not assigned in `MXPredCreatePartialOut`, \r\nthus the `PredictorHandle` created by `MXPredCreatePartialOut` cannot be reshaped in `MXPredReshape`.\r\nThis was pointed out in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10502, and likely also related to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11413, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10937.\r\n\r\nAlso removed the clean-up of the original handle,\r\n```\r\n  p->arg_arrays.clear();\r\n  ...\r\n  p->aux_arrays.clear();\r\n```\r\nin `MXPredReshape`, as it makes the original handle invalid. I think it would be better to leave the freedom to the user that whether they want to free the old handle after reshaping, or to free the reshaped new handle after use and revive the old one.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-29T14:12:38Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T21:50:26Z","closed_at":"2018-08-14T13:12:37Z","merged_at":"2018-08-14T13:12:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3070fbe04b94e9715ef950cb33ce3402be5c077","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":919645457,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTk2NDU0NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/C%20API","name":"C

Description ##\r\nAt the moment, Apache RAT is being installed during runtime. This is not time-efficient and will cause future problems if we move the RAT check into the sanity check.\r\n\r\nNow, it will be part of a Dockerfile and thus cached. Execution time is about 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nAlso, we're moving the Apache RAT check to the PR pipeline instead of running it nightly.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Moved Apache RAT installation into Dockerfile\r\n- Apache RAT check is now part of PR pipeline\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\n`MXNetError` is thrown in the event of a CUDA error (e.g., `Check failed: err == cudaSuccess ...`). While ideally we'd never encounter this, it happens sometimes, and we'd like to program our scala code to take the appropriate action (i.e., restart the process).\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes making the `MXNetError` class public, so that we can `catch` it in our calling code. Without it, we need to put our calling code in the `org.apache.mxnet` package, which we'd rather not do if we can avoid it.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nAs part of the effort to update models to the new inference API we're also moving to a new folder. This example isn't an inference one but still needs to be moved.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@lanking520 @nswamy

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThe dependency rule doesn't work in Mac.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-28T20:39:14Z","updated_at":"2018-07-05T06:18:36Z","closed_at":"2018-06-28T23:17:18Z","merged_at":"2018-06-28T23:17:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"4cdc150af8250665b7880f8fbda830eb26476fb7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bfbe594e65686d7bb0bec430d7c0757691e3e94f","head":{"label":"zheng-da:fix_mkldnn_build","ref":"fix_mkldnn_build","sha":"bfbe594e65686d7bb0bec430d7c0757691e3e94f","user":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103710066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3MTAwNjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis was found during the flaky test investigation https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10973 . I found that the windows code path is different from linux, so it was testing the MXNet conv and deconv op which was not being tested for linux. Building with USE_CUDNN=0 and USE_CUDA=1 was failing and I have added the fix here. I have also added the build and test as a stage to jenkins. Not sure if there was a reason to not check this in CI (configuration not supported by some ops etc.) \r\n\r\n@marcoabreu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to address the request to have a native temperature parameter in the softmax functions. See [Issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11016) for more detailed discussion.\r\n\r\nI have added the temperature parameter to softmax operator. By default the temperature parameter value is 1.0 and both functions should behave the same as not specifying the temperature parameter.\r\n\r\nVerified the change using the following code in Python:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable('data')\r\nnet = mx.sym.softmax(data=data, temperature=10)\r\n\r\nx = mx.nd.array([ 1,  2,  3])\r\n\r\nex = net.bind(mx.cpu(), args={'data': x, 'softmax2_label': 'softmax2'})\r\nex.forward()\r\n```\r\nshould expect return\r\n```\r\n[\r\n[ 0.30060961  0.33222499  0.3671654 ]\r\n <NDArray 3 @cpu(0)>]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Added a unit test to cover the new parameter\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Softmax operator with new temperature parameter(unittest at test_operator.py:test_softmax_with_temperature)\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This change is backward compatible. The default value of temperature is 1.0f\r\n- Because 90% of the time (empirically) user will use this operator using the default temperature, I have added a \"if else\" branch in CPU computation to optimize the runtime by getting rid of the unnecessary 'divide-by-one' operation. This is not done in GPU kernel because 1) adding if branch will have negative runtime impact in GPU, 2) CUDA compiler may perform additional optimization on this edge case.\r\n- I have use check_speed function to verify this optimization in CPU. In my experiment, I choose a vector of size 10000 and run 10 times. The runtime reduction is about 25%. Experiment code is pasted below:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet.test_utils import check_speed\r\ndata_shape=(1,10000)\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable(name='data',shape=data_shape)\r\nctx=mx.cpu(0)\r\nx = mx.nd.random.normal(0, 1.0, shape=data_shape, ctx=ctx)\r\nnet = mx.sym.softmax(data=data)\r\nsoftmax_time = check_speed(sym=net, location={'data': x}, ctx=ctx, N=10, grad_req='null', typ='forward') * 1000\r\nprint(softmax_time)\r\n```","created_at":"2018-06-28T18:20:52Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T17:10:02Z","closed_at":"2018-07-19T19:56:07Z","merged_at":"2018-07-19T19:56:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1f2f44118887debc380d43711257b7df099678a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d20bfde73ec8fa71603dfee63c3cbf15f6786183","head":{"label":"apeforest:feature/operator_enhancement","ref":"feature/operator_enhancement","sha":"d20bfde73ec8fa71603dfee63c3cbf15f6786183","user":{"login":"apeforest","id":6807113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDcxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6807113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest","html_url":"https://github.com/apeforest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137406452,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzc0MDY0NTI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"apeforest/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apeforest","id":6807113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDcxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6807113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest","html_url":"https://github.com/apeforest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apeforest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apeforest/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR increases the retry count for the coverage http call.  The retry will be triggered for all 4xx and 5xx codes.  It will also use exponential backoff, doubling each iteration, starting at a delay of 1s by default.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

moving some test platforms from PR-validation to nightly. Our experience has shown that testing so many different flavours of Python multiple times doesn't help. Additionally, we're not getting much value out of testing GPU on Windows, considering that we're already testing GPU en-masse in other platforms. \r\n\r\nInstead, we're moving these tests to the nightly stage and remove the duplicate ones. If we notice that we're getting regressions introduced that are not revealed by the current pipeline, we'll revert this decision and bring GPU tests back to the PR validation stage. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have moved the MKLDNN validation on Windows from GPU to CPU. I don't know why we're running tests for a CPU backend on a GPU instance with CUDA enabled. @TaoLv @pengzhao-intel @zheng-da might want to

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

###\r\n- Fixed issue of precision issue of test case #11410 test_rnnrelu_bidirectional and test_rnnrelu_sym.  Sometimes, the data comparison will fail because of tolerance of precision, like 0.043388 and 0.04405. In our testing environment, the biggest testing result deviation is around difference between 0.027... and 0.037... sometimes. Adjust the tolerance to fix the issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n - [X] Passed code style checking (make lint).\r\n - [X] All changes have test coverage.\r\n - [ ] Code is

Description ##\r\nModified test_operator_gpu.test_spatial_transformer_with_type test in order to remove its flakiness\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] removed predefined seed from the test\r\n- [X] updated precision of comparison object from float32 to float64\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nI confirmed that original test code was causing test to consistently fail even with 100 iterations of running it with the error specified in original [issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/7645). After code modification I tested on 100,000 iterations and didn't notice single test failure.\r\n`PYTHONPATH=./python/ MXNET_TEST_COUNT=100000 nosetests —verbose tests/python/gpu/test_operator_gpu.py:test_spatial_transformer_with_type` was used to run the test.","created_at":"2018-06-28T03:35:25Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T16:13:35Z","closed_at":"2018-06-28T23:16:30Z","merged_at":"2018-06-28T23:16:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"f7a00250cf83ba34779b7c6ffc02532d20795f2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ab1ffcce4d110bd1d113d0dce169f369a7006a5b","head":{"label":"ddavydenko:flaky-fix-7645","ref":"flaky-fix-7645","sha":"ab1ffcce4d110bd1d113d0dce169f369a7006a5b","user":{"login":"ddavydenko","id":1585364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODUzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1585364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ddavydenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138940374,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg5NDAzNzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"ddavydenko/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ddavydenko","id":1585364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODUzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1585364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ddavydenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddavydenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ddavydenko/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis is to handle the case that inputs and outputs of a graph in CachedOp share NDArrays.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-27T22:11:03Z","updated_at":"2018-07-05T06:18:56Z","closed_at":"2018-07-02T17:42:34Z","merged_at":"2018-07-02T17:42:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"d6a8ca79b7dd8e253fe3b81a345e8f375b6a0b38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11436/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11436/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11436/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/065414d7ef47a0e55ed3ecb90d64bfdd00b42d6e","head":{"label":"zheng-da:fix_cachedop","ref":"fix_cachedop","sha":"065414d7ef47a0e55ed3ecb90d64bfdd00b42d6e","user":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103710066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3MTAwNjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR disables some tests that have been flaky (failing non-deterministically in CI).\r\n\r\nDisabled tests:\r\n\r\n- test_quantization.test_get_optimal_thresholds https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11456\r\n- test_hybrid_static_memory_switching https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11171\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nAdd nswamy@ to CODEOWNERS for scala-package and cpp-package\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nThis includes an accumulation of memory-leak fixes in Scala package. Will go and test all examples we have in CI to make sure it didn't break.\r\n\r\nWarning: We need to treat this PR carefully, it has the potential to cause Scala test flaky\r\n\r\n@yzhliu @nswamy

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis is the example written in new API in Scala. It include the following two tests:\r\n\r\ncustomOp : Runs only on CPU\r\n\r\ncustomOpRtc: Runs only on GPU\r\n\r\nI also add some modification on Macros to disable Custom operator from generation. Instead, I create a Custom Operator in SymbolAPI. Add TODO in NDArray's one.\r\n\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-26T06:08:47Z","updated_at":"2018-07-18T20:26:20Z","closed_at":"2018-07-18T16:20:38Z","merged_at":"2018-07-18T16:20:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"072dd5a51c813afd789f3b45ed6b515de6fb756d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/056ec6c654b97ef1215d7353d93c444c7e5836a6","head":{"label":"lanking520:customop","ref":"customop","sha":"056ec6c654b97ef1215d7353d93c444c7e5836a6","user":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123362138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMzNjIxMzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"lanking520/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nIn this PR, it creates Fused Vanilla RNN(tanh/relu) operator and dropout of GRU/LSTM/vRNN for CPU.\r\n@pengzhao-intel, @TaoLv \r\n\r\n## Feature changes ##\r\n### New features ###\r\n- Single layer/Multiple layer and unidirectional/bidirectional Vanilla RNN(tanh/relu), including both forward and backward computation.\r\n- Support dropout of GRU/LSTM/vRNN\r\n\r\n### Unit-test changes ###\r\n- Create new testcase in tests/python/unittests/test_operator.py.\r\n- update testcase in example/rnn/bucketing/cudnn_rnn_bucketing.py\r\n- Check consistency with original RNNCell implementation.\r\n\r\n### Performance ###\r\nWe have tested performance of FusedRNN and NonFused RNNCell on our local Skylake-8180 with 2 Sockets and 56 cores. Use MKL as blas lib in this performance test.\r\nTest input size is from DS2 default parameters(seq_length = 300, batch_size = 20, input_size = 800, hidden_size = 800).\r\n\r\nLayer=1 bidirectional =

Description ##\r\nIn Python, expressions like `nd.random_uniform(shape=[5, 5, 0])` cause the runtime to crash. The underlying problem seems to be a division by zero in [`LaunchRNG(...)` at line 50](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/random/sampler.h#L50). The divisor `nthread` is zero because `nloop` is zero when `N` is zero due to C++ integer division rules (`N` is zero because the size of the `NDArray` above is zero).\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11398 for the bug report.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added a check in `LaunchRNG(...)` to ensure `N` is not zero. Small negative values for `N` would also cause division by zero, but small negative numbers (induced by things like `nd.random_uniform(shape=[5, 5, -1])`) cause allocation failures before this code is even reached, but I check that case to be safe.\r\n- Simply returning if `N <= 0` should be sufficient because the map operation effectively does nothing in this case.","created_at":"2018-06-26T00:14:00Z","updated_at":"2018-07-25T21:50:30Z","closed_at":"2018-07-25T17:52:15Z","merged_at":"2018-07-25T17:52:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b8b93995e253f362399de1e2e8c63d112933289","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b5683aa645ce27bafb82c2d4bedf27c515ca2ec2","head":{"label":"toddsundsted:check-shape","ref":"check-shape","sha":"b5683aa645ce27bafb82c2d4bedf27c515ca2ec2","user":{"login":"toddsundsted","id":58405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted","html_url":"https://github.com/toddsundsted","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138661134,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg2NjExMzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"toddsundsted/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"toddsundsted","id":58405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted","html_url":"https://github.com/toddsundsted","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddsundsted/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/toddsundsted/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAs title, plus a fix for erroneous handling of some edge case\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fix flakiness in test_sparse_dot\r\n- [x] Fix erroneous handling of empty csr case \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThe tests are failing consistently by a small margin, bumping up rtol to get rid of the flakiness.\r\n#10920 #11367

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

The reason for this is that if the epsilon chosen in the model is less than the cuDNN minimum (CUDNN_BN_MIN_EPSILON), the cuDNN call will fail. However, cuDNN BatchNorm need not be always disabled when importing models. This PR adds an ability to query the value of CUDNN_BN_MIN_EPSILON, and only disable cuDNN BatchNorm during ONNX import if the value from the ONNX model is less than the cuDNN minimum. The ability to query the minimum cuDNN value can also be helpful in other scenarios, such as when verifying if the value in a model is too small for numeric stability (the cuDNN value is quite reasonable as a minimum).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- This is a tiny change so only the call to get the value of CUDNN_BN_MIN_EPSILON (mx.base.get_cudnn_epsilon) needs documentation\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] `mx.base.get_cudnn_epsilon()` implementation (`python/mxnet/base.py`)\r\n- [x] test of `get_cudnn_epsilon()` at `tests/python/gpu/test_cudnn_eps.py`\r\n- [x] adaptation of the ONNX importer to only disable cuDNN BatchNorm if cuDNN is not available, or the epsilon from the ONNX model is less than CUDNN_BN_MIN_EPSILON (`python/mxnet/contrib/onnx/_import/op_translations.py`)\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-24T05:17:57Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T05:36:33Z","closed_at":"2018-07-11T05:36:33Z","merged_at":"2018-07-11T05:36:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"d814733f16d50b2dd51b6f3e7e3256b5e66c8026","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11380/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11380/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11380/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/610aff9266e3f1eb6cba0173ef82c32c658f90f3","head":{"label":"mkolod:cudnn_epsilon_query","ref":"cudnn_epsilon_query","sha":"610aff9266e3f1eb6cba0173ef82c32c658f90f3","user":{"login":"mkolod","id":476135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/476135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod","html_url":"https://github.com/mkolod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137289088,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcyODkwODg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"mkolod/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mkolod","id":476135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/476135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod","html_url":"https://github.com/mkolod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkolod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mkolod/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres @anirudh2290\r\nPlease see the fix for the issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10387\r\n\r\nit may help this as well: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8383\r\n\r\nAfter discussion with @andrewfayres , we found the problems was in the Scala section, ~~the last value of the arange is larger than the stop value~~ multiple numbers in the Array are different. We think this should be a bug of Scala as the function is depreciated in the log. As @reminisce recommended, we can increase the minimum value of the step since there is nobody use step in a E-05 level. In summary, there are several ways we can solve this problem:\r\n\r\n- [x] ~~Change the precision level of arange into E-03 and remove the last value of the array.~~ Doesn't help, problem persist\r\n\r\n- [x] ~~Change the way that Scala works into While loops and set precision level to E-06~~ Doesn't help, problem still there...\r\n\r\n- [x] ~~Change the measurement from `reid_diff` into `almost_equal` which mostly used in Python with `rtol = true` and precision level E-04.~~ Doesn't help, problem still there\r\n\r\n- [x] Use BigDecimal and while loop to test, Passed!\r\n\r\n- [ ] Run multiple times with a fixed number in the start, stop and step since the target in here is to check arange is doing well.\r\n\r\nWe cannot reproduce the same issue with python after 1M tests done by @haojin2 . Python use numpy which takes `Float` as `Double` in their calculation with high accuracy. This PR represent as the ticked solution shown above. Currently, I keep 100000 runs in the code to make sure CI will pass as well. Will consider remove that when we merge into master.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, this issue is really rare to come out. I tried 100k and the issue is 70% reproducible. With the amended solution, I ran 10 times 100k and all of them passed. Since we already have a concrete Python test for this operator, consider remove this in the nearer future.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items

R memory leakage through refactor of the optimizers. \r\nGiven the mutatable NDArray isn't supported in R, optimizers have been ported as symbolic update, an executor being created for each weight. \r\n\r\n! Only optimizers update symbols have been used for now, so only SGD, rmsprop and Adam are now supported. Will need to reimplement the manual update for Adagrad and Adadelta. \r\n\r\nMemory is now kept at low level even for very large networks and embeddings. \r\nTested on CPU and single GPU, not multiple GPUs.

Description ##\r\nPeople complain about the Faster R-CNN example a lot.\r\n\r\n- Hard to install. Now we only require packages that can be installed via pip.\r\n- Too much code, some of them duplicate. Now it is reduced from ~9k to ~3k lines.\r\n- Too difficult to configure. Now hyper parameters are tunable through command line arguments instead of a central global config. Just type `python3 train.py -h` to see all of them.\r\n- Not compatible with MXNet API changes. We reduced the code complexity to ease maintenance for API updates. The old released models and training scripts are still working.\r\n- Not compatible with Python 3. It is generally about print, true division. Fixed and tested now.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAll changes are limited to example/rcnn folder. Basically no new features are added.\r\n- Remove complex code of Cython, CUDA, pycocotools. Pure python data processing is used instead.\r\n- Remove duplicate and unnecessary code in data processing for two-stage Fast R-CNN training. Why still maintain two-stage Fast R-CNN if we have end-to-end training?\r\n- Remove shell scripts because demo, train, test can be used directly.\r\n- Reorganize the code to be dataset loading, data processing, network construction and user scripts.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nNote that data processing speed of the pure numpy code could be a limitation, especially for crowded dataset like COCO. However, numpy code is concise and accurate, which can serve as future reference to build better implementations.","created_at":"2018-06-23T02:27:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T00:22:03Z","closed_at":"2018-07-13T00:48:49Z","merged_at":"2018-07-13T00:48:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7667126163c0d90c5cfab19579272ea714cf949","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bc694c664802bca4cd60322c3c22618d9a76b491","head":{"label":"ijkguo:master","ref":"master","sha":"bc694c664802bca4cd60322c3c22618d9a76b491","user":{"login":"ijkguo","id":13162287,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTYyMjg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13162287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo","html_url":"https://github.com/ijkguo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56666837,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjY2NjgzNw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"ijkguo/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijkguo","id":13162287,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTYyMjg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13162287?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo","html_url":"https://github.com/ijkguo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijkguo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijkguo/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdd test for MKLDNN concat forward / backward operator\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add test for MKLDNN concat forward / backward operator\r\n- [x] Modify GetTestInputArrays / GetOutputInputArrays to support `num_inputs` / `dim` so that the inputs / outputs can be scaled (used to create larger ndarrays scaled by `num_inputs` on `dim`)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-22T23:22:37Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T15:54:51Z","closed_at":"2018-06-29T15:54:51Z","merged_at":"2018-06-29T15:54:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"af4a6005c67cc391567156686dd0ee9867ac7c0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11371/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11371/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11371/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9dbb0dac9f327cf3bd1edb053b60e4a270413ebe","head":{"label":"azai91:test/concat","ref":"test/concat","sha":"9dbb0dac9f327cf3bd1edb053b60e4a270413ebe","user":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109348168,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkzNDgxNjg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"azai91/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/azai91/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nCon't fix as #10628 is closed. \r\nThis is considered a temporary solution, until a backend support is merged.\r\nNo API change.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here","created_at":"2018-06-22T23:12:46Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T23:37:51Z","closed_at":"2018-06-25T23:28:06Z","merged_at":"2018-06-25T23:28:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"72fa6a9349143a08c23e3949932ca53218804163","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/370921750b05d9b1f3bd57f49469a38797ec3e30","head":{"label":"zhreshold:fix-mp-fseek","ref":"fix-mp-fseek","sha":"370921750b05d9b1f3bd57f49469a38797ec3e30","user":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69486423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTQ4NjQyMw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"zhreshold/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nThe test is used to obtain 5000 samples from `random.multinomial` op when provided a probability ndarray as input. It calculates count of the number of samples of each index (in input) and divides it by total samples to obtain the probability. This computed probability is then compared to the actual probability that is provided to the op. To make this test completely non flaky we would have to obtain infinite number of samples. To alleivate the pain caused by flakiness of this test for now, I have increased the number of samples to 10k, increased atol to 0.1 and also added a retry for the test if it fails. Hopefully, these three actions should reduce the flakiness of the test by a huge extent. I tested for 2000 runs on my machine without failure.\r\n\r\nFixes #10838 \r\n\r\n@haojin2  @asitstands \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items

Description ##\r\nThis PR added an open-source LSTM RNN implementation, and also included benchmarks for comparison between different LSTM RNN backends and tools for measurements. This [**arxiv paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08899.pdf) contains more implementation details. \r\n\r\nThe end-to-end training throughput comparison on the **Wikitext-2 language-modeling benchmark** between MXNet default implementation (**Default**), cuDNN 6 (**cuDNN**) and OpenLSTMRNN (**Open**) implementation of LSTM RNN is shown in the diagram below:\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  <img

Description ##\r\nThis pull request tries to let users have option to select determinisic algorithms.\r\nThere are three algorithms are not determinisic accoring to cudnn sdk devement\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-developer-guide/index.html#reproducibility\r\n \r\n2.5. Reproducibility (determinism)\r\nBy design, most of cuDNN's routines from a given version generate the same bit-wise results across runs when executed on GPUs with the same architecture and the same number of SMs. However, bit-wise reproducibility is not guaranteed across versions, as the implementation of a given routine may change. With the current release, the following routines do not guarantee reproducibility because they use atomic operations:\r\n\r\ncudnnConvolutionBackwardFilter when CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_BWD_FILTER_ALGO_0 or CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_BWD_FILTER_ALGO_3 is used\r\ncudnnConvolutionBackwardData when CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_BWD_DATA_ALGO_0 is used\r\ncudnnPoolingBackward when CUDNN_POOLING_MAX is used\r\ncudnnSpatialTfSamplerBackward\r\n \r\nSolution here convers the first 3 except cudnnSpatialTfSamplerBackward:\r\n\r\n- Add deterministic parameter (default = False) to Maxpooling\r\nnn.MaxPool2D(pool_size=(3,3), strides=(2,2)  ,deterministic=True)\r\n\r\n- Add env parameters to select Deterministic algorithms for Conv back propagation algorithm\r\nos.environ[\"MXNET_CUDNN_AUTOTUNE_DEFAULT\"] = \"3\"\r\n\r\n#Value of 1 chooses the best algo in a limited workspace\r\n#Value of 2 chooses the fastest algo whose memory requirements may be larger than the default workspace threshold\r\n#Value of 3 choose the Determinisitc best algo in a limited workspace\r\n#Value of 4 chooses the Determinisitc fastest algo whose memory requirements may be larger than the default workspace threshold\r\n\r\nI did manual test, so automatic tests still need to be added.\r\n\r\n**The problem of this solution is that cudnn still can select different deterministic algorithms and they do not give the exactly same results between algorithms. \r\nPropose to add extra varaibles to force algortithm selection....**\r\n\r\n******************the following

knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-22T05:14:21Z","updated_at":"2018-12-22T03:15:49Z","closed_at":"2018-06-25T22:34:55Z","merged_at":"2018-06-25T22:34:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"619e4bded058e4bf77029bc30b395275d72f7907","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11360/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11360/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11360/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3b7e9663b9a59c0236ac2789fa3dfe10d760a1d0","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:test-flaky","ref":"test-flaky","sha":"3b7e9663b9a59c0236ac2789fa3dfe10d760a1d0","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nSingle machine All Reduce Topology-aware Communication\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Proposed communication method shows speed-up compared to both existing methods (parameter server and NCCL) on small batch sizes for

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to address the request to have a native temperature parameter in the softmax functions. See [Issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11016) for more detailed discussion.\r\n\r\nI have added the temperature parameter to both softmax and SoftmaxOutput operators. By default the temperature parameter value is 1.0 and both functions should behave the same as not specifying the temperature parameter.\r\n\r\nVerified the change using the following code in Python:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable('data')\r\nnet = mx.sym.softmax(data=data, temperature=10)\r\n\r\nx = mx.nd.array([ 1,  2,  3])\r\n\r\nex = net.bind(mx.cpu(), args={'data': x, 'softmax2_label': 'softmax2'})\r\nex.forward()\r\n```\r\nshould expect return\r\n```\r\n[\r\n[ 0.30060961  0.33222499  0.3671654 ]\r\n <NDArray 3 @cpu(0)>]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- In the implementation of softmax function, I added a check for the default case where temperature equals 1.0 to remove the unnecessary divide-by-1 operation in the calculation. I have run an offline experiment of softmax function alone compiled with g++ -O3. The single core runtime can be reduced by around 25% with this optimization

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge,

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds the test result publishing of Windows Python tests. Previously, this was disabled due to restrictions in our Windows AMI, but this has been changed now.\r\n\r\nThis serves as base for our flaky test detection.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Enable XUnit for Windows\r\n\r\n## Comments

test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by
