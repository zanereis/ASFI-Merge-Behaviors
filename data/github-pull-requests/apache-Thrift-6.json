Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nPreviously it was not possible to access the handler object after it was passed to the service processor. This practically prevents the use of any state which is not wrapped by a reference counted pointer. Especially in single-threaded scenarios, this may be undesirable.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ x ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ x ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [ x ] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ x ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ x ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

building image requires kerl to build erlang, which requires >10\r\nmin to build and meanwhile not printing to stdout, failing the travis\r\nbuild\r\n\r\nCurrently the travis CI is broken because the step when kerl is building erlang OTP from source but the build process produces no output for >10 mins and travis will then fail the build if no output is detected.\r\n\r\nThe max number of build errors has been reached so now the travis CI build is suspended.\r\n\r\nThe easy fix is to allow travis to wait a bit longer (the erlang build itself takes around 1100 seconds).\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\ntravis ci to use xenial as base image  \r\n\r\ncurrently the base image for travis ci is trusty but currently the default is xenial. the ci job

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\nMotivation for a separate kotlin code gen:\r\n1. Use data class\r\n1. Use coroutine interface (and jdk8 adapter)\r\n1. Use idiomatic kotlin syntax\r\n1. Leverage existing java libthrift (it does not have a new runtime, instead the generated code will be relying on the libthrift runtime code)\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\nadd java code gen param to support including field annotation as metadata\r\n\r\nCurrently the code generator has a map of string to string field that denotes the \"annotations\" for a field: https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/90ea2e8398eda32da8be0b3514516e7ad932a869/compiler/cpp/src/thrift/parse/t_field.h#L109\r\n\r\nIt is made available to generators such as JSON (in https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/90ea2e8398eda32da8be0b3514516e7ad932a869/compiler/cpp/src/thrift/generate/t_json_generator.cc#L267-L274) to allow (runtime) interpretation of such metadata.\r\n\r\nIn Java, similar mechanism exists to register field metadata (via https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/90ea2e8398eda32da8be0b3514516e7ad932a869/compiler/cpp/src/thrift/generate/t_java_generator.cc#L2862-L2865 which calls `org.apache.thrift.meta_data.FieldMetaData#addStructMetaDataMap` method to register into a centralized places. Such metadata is useful, e.g. the microservice framework Ameria [uses it][1] to dynamically proxy requests.\r\n\r\nHowever the existing field metadata only contain information about field id, type, and name, but it does not contain annotations. Adding annotations will be useful for situations e.g. (these are useful enablement at user side, make possible if annotation is included)\r\n\r\n- some static metadata is useful at runtime for dynamic operations, e.g. like what `deprecated` means in the context of a field, adding `obfuscated` allows the user site to decide to obfuscate detailed information\r\n- allows for more richer and more type specific validation and transformation logic, e.g. since we can only have string as field type, adding `date_format=\"YYYY-MM-DD\"` allows the thrift struct to be interpreted as a local date and thus can automatically be converted to java.time.LocalDate\r\n\r\nThis should be a back-compatible change as the default behavior is not to include the annotation. A second constructor can be added to allow included annotation to exist and register.\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing properly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[1]:

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nRelated to [THRIFT-5535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5535).\r\n\r\nIn a word, I modified `lib/nodejs/lib/thrift/http_connection.js` to support OpenHarmony OS data request [API](https://developer.harmonyos.com/en/docs/documentation/doc-references/js-apis-net-http-0000001168304341#section24678814124).\r\n\r\n> Maybe what you propose fits better under /contrib than in the general library.\r\n\r\nOpenHarmony OS supports importing node.js module as dependency, and that this module required other node.js modules such as `TJSONProtocol`, so I still do that under nodejs lib.\r\n\r\nBecause OpenHarmony OS runs with the browserify environment, these interfaces were exported in `browser.js`.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to write test use case, but I created a [demo](https://github.com/konpeki622/openHarmony-thrift-demo) for test. You can try it with `npm link`.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

rs\r\n\r\nThe Thrift crate does not support Unix Domain Sockets (UDS). After reviewing and expressing my thoughts on THRIFT-5283, I added support for UDS.\r\n\r\nThis is not a breaking change. Inspired by how actix_web::HttpServer supports UDS, I added an additional fn to listen to UDS. I reorganized some other existing code to be able to reuse it for UDS. I also had to implement the trait TIoChannel for UnixStream. This went to transport::socket.\r\n\r\nAs UnixStream is only available on Unix, I tagged the code with #[cfg(unix)]. I also cross compiled lib/rs to Windows with the following cargo targets:\r\n\r\n    i686-pc-windows-gnu\r\n    i686-pc-windows-msvc\r\n    x86_64-pc-windows-gnu\r\n    x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\n\r\nLast but not least I ran the rust <-> rust test harnesses as well as the cross test harnesses.

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n* ~Update Erlang lib to be compatible for OTP-24~\r\n  * ~`This` makes it incompatible to OTP-20 and less unfortunately~\r\n* Pin OTP and rebar3 versions in Docker images\r\n* Fix Go zlib cross tests\r\n\r\nThere were additional issues so I'm focusing on fixing CI in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Failure1: dpkg deps\r\n\r\nDockerfile changes introduced this error in dpkg.sh\r\n```\r\ndpkg-checkbuilddeps: error: Unmet build dependencies: **erlang-base**\r\n```\r\nhttps://app.travis-ci.com/github/apache/thrift/jobs/562353250\r\n\r\nSince we're not building any erlang dpkgs, I'm going to simply remove this from dpkg dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Failure2: Go zlib cross test\r\n\r\n```\r\nExecuting: /thrift/src/test/go/bin/testclient --protocol=binary --transport=zlib --zlib --port=35362\r\n...\r\nflag provided but not defined: -zlib\r\n...\r\nReturn code: 2 (negative values indicate kill by signal)\r\n```\r\nhttps://app.travis-ci.com/github/apache/thrift/jobs/562353240#L21363\r\n\r\n(Why it was working before in the first place?)\r\nBy explicitly parsing `--zlib` redundant flag, it works.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

I also had to implement the trait TIoChannel for UnixStream. This went to transport::socket.\r\n\r\nAs UnixStream is only available on Unix, I tagged the code with #[cfg(unix)]. However, I was not able to test the build on Windows. I hope for the CI to detect any build issues on Windows.","created_at":"2022-03-05T20:22:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T15:56:26Z","closed_at":"2022-03-07T15:56:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd65ef09ff5120e6f102d5a5a64437b556a289da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/f6cccec727025947871a56f3fc896d4005691d30","head":{"label":"tokcum:THRIFT-3877","ref":"THRIFT-3877","sha":"f6cccec727025947871a56f3fc896d4005691d30","user":{"login":"tokcum","id":47994370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTk0Mzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47994370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum","html_url":"https://github.com/tokcum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tokcum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b8920b01cb72af93a716bb203fcd8a1202936b97","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":310611,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTA2MTE=","name":"thrift","full_name":"apache/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift","description":"Apache

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nWe encountered a problem that caused the CPU to fill up (24 thread, 40 core), it seems to be due to the readBufferBytesAllocated not being properly calculated and the frameSize is large.\r\n\r\nSo i think that even if the variable is correctly evaluated, it is necessary to add a separate parameter limit to the frameSize, rather than reusing the maxReadBufferBytes.\r\n\r\nps. this large frame should be come from security check detection, also it could be attack\r\n\r\n24 core is

request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [ ] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

ensures the Send/ReceiveTimeout properties of the TcpClient are used.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the (TSocket)Transport is closed/disposed when this exception is thrown.\r\nOtherwise the next Read operation will read the message that is sent after the timeout in the stream.\r\n\r\nImo this is not a breaking change because this is the desired behavior.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing
