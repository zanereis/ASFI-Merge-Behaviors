title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nReally small UX improvement. \r\nFrom end user's perspective, when I set date time in one tab on DAG detail page I expect to see other graphs for the same datetime. Current UX is confusing as when you select Base date in one tab, and goes to the second tab, the second tab reset the datetime and shows all the records. This implementation keeps the datetime same for all the tabs/charts. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt's .html file changes, and does not need unit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWebserver parses DagBag twice during start up, thus causes webserver start up being slow with large number of DAG files. This change reduces the start up time of webserver to almost half by making sure the DagBag model doesn't parse DAGs twice during the start up process. More details and discussions here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3506\r\nFYI: @yrqls21 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2755\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] This PR adds the `kubernetes.worker_dags_folder` configuration to avoid `import` errors on workers caused by the `AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER` environment variable hardcoded to `/tmp/dags`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests: \r\n- `TestKubernetesWorkerConfiguration.test_worker_environment_no_dags_folder` tests that when the `kubernetes.worker_dags_folder` configuration is blank, the `AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER` environment variable is not set\r\n- `TestKubernetesWorkerConfiguration.test_worker_environment_when_dags_folder_specified` tests that when the `kubernetes.worker_dags_folder` configuration is set, this ends up in the `AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER` workers' environment variable\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2758\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a sensor for MongoDB,\r\nwhich waits for some document that\r\nmatches the given query to be\r\ninserted to the specified collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntests/contrib/sensors/test_mongo_sensor.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

from URI to be decoded using urllib.parse module.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTrivial change to existing code.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\nWow this is a tedious way to welcome a new contributor. How about I'll rebase the commit with the desired name schema once someone gives me an indication that it is likely to be accepted? :-)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-14T00:00:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T22:49:08Z","closed_at":"2019-01-10T22:49:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96e9297a0c96f7807ed61b6643518e3a409af42f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1729\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2729\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe can ignore whole directories by removing them from the `dirs` array\r\nthat `os.walk()` returns. Doing this means that we fewer disk ops if\r\nsomeone has a set of modules in their dag folder that they want to\r\nignore.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes [AIRFLOW-2797] - we weren't honoring .airflowignore from a\r\nparent dir as of #3717 -- that (expected) behaviour is now back again.\r\n\r\nDe-duplicate the walking code as well - we had two versions that had\r\ngotten out of sync as of #3171. So that doesn't happen again we now only\r\nhave one version.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: we don't currently have any mechanism in place to mock/test airflow ignore behaviour. I'm not happy about opening a PR that fixes a regression without a unittest to cover it :(\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [Lx ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - Added note to make

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2748) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Currently the QuboleOperator & qubole_hook in the Airflow codebase doesn't support `use_customer_cluster`, `customer_cluster_label`  and `hive_serde` command arguments in Airflow. This PR is for adding the above functionality. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] This is a very small change to add additional parameters to the API (Qubole SDK) call, hence doesn't require adding test cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2735\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nApologies for the rookie mistake, I'm relatively new to Python and missed this on my last patch (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3567).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2734\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHi all - I'm seeing the following warning from setuptools about the way the version string is currently set in `version.py` which gets loaded by `setup.py`.\r\n\r\n\t$ python setup.py\r\n\t/Users/taylor/.local/share/virtualenvs/airflow-no-hooks/lib/python3.6/site-packages/setuptools/dist.py:398: UserWarning: Normalizing '2.0.0dev0+incubating' to '2.0.0.dev0+incubating'\r\n\t  normalized_version,\r\n\tusage: setup.py [global_opts] cmd1 [cmd1_opts] [cmd2 [cmd2_opts] ...]\r\n\t   or: setup.py --help [cmd1 cmd2 ...]\r\n\t   or: setup.py --help-commands\r\n\t   or: setup.py cmd --help\r\n\r\n(Note the `.` that gets added in front of `dev`.)\r\n\r\nI checked the [semver docs](https://semver.org/), and it looks like they prefer a hyphen like `2.0.0-dev0+incubating` but `setuptools` complains similarly about that.\r\n\r\nIt looks like Airflow versioning was previously done with the separator dot [pre-1.8](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/7bb750d7d20dc0c74b091edc4614d25c51615ac0#diff-c3edc8499f1784000f57b09b7c429e83).\r\n\r\nPlease excuse this PR if this was an intentional change in convention or there's some Apache release versioning guideline I'm missing.\r\n\r\nI checked PySpark for a reference Python project under Apache and it looks like they're using the separator dot convention in [pyspark/version.py](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/eb6e9880397dbac8b0b9ebc0796150b6924fc566/python/pyspark/version.py).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - no code change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-10T01:40:49Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T17:18:52Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T16:42:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"616ff49010db3162194991f44cec40774b5af549","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3588/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3588/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3588/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fa4fe7d946efa4c7f668969432531258cdaae24e","head":{"label":"astronomer:normalized-version","ref":"normalized-version","sha":"fa4fe7d946efa4c7f668969432531258cdaae24e","user":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65323404,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTMyMzQwNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"astronomer/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2731\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - Allow Airflow to be co-installed with psutil >=5.0.0\r\n  - Airflow's usage of psutil does not depend on features changed/removed between psutil 4.x and psutil 5.x so the prohibition is overly strict\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - Library bounds changed on library whose interface has not change w.r.t. Airflow\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n\r\nAIRFLOW-249 Refactor the SLA mechanism\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly large patch that should and/or may also address:\r\n\r\nAIRFLOW-1360 SLA miss goes to all emails in DAG\r\nAIRFLOW-2236 Airflow SLA is triggered for all backfilled tasks\r\nAIRFLOW-557 SLA notification does not work for manually triggered DAGs\r\nAIRFLOW-133 SLAs don't seem to work with schedule_interval=None\r\nAIRFLOW-1013 airflow/jobs.py:manage_slas() exception for @once dag\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAt Quantopian we use Airflow to produce artifacts based on the previous day's stock market data. These artifacts are required for us to trade on today's stock market. Therefore, I've been investing time in improving Airflow notifications (such as writing PagerDuty and Slack integrations). My attention has turned to Airflow's SLA system, which has some drawbacks for our use case:\r\n\r\n1) Defining SLAs can be awkward because they are relative to the execution date instead of the task start time. There's no way to alert if a task runs for \"more than an hour\", for any non-trivial DAG. Instead you can only express \"more than an hour from execution date\".  The financial data we use varies in when it arrives, and how long it takes to process (data volume changes frequently). We also run DAGs with mixed UTC and Eastern events, making Airflow SLA definitions depend on time of year.\r\n\r\n2) Execution timeouts can capture \"more than an hour\" but do not serve the same purpose as SLAs. We have tight timelines on long-duration tasks that make retries difficult, so we want to alert an operator while leaving the original task running, rather than failing and then alerting.\r\n\r\n3) The way that SLA miss callbacks are defined is not intuitive, as in contrast to other callbacks, they are defined on the DAG rather than on the task. This has lead to a lot of confusion in JIRA/the mailing list; many people think that SLAs are for DAG completion, when in reality it's a DAG-level attribute that handles batched task-level completions. Also, the call signature is poorly defined: for instance, two of the arguments are just strings produced from the other two arguments.\r\n\r\n4) SLA miss emails don't include any links back to the Airflow instance (important for us because we run the same DAGs in both staging/production) or the execution date they apply to. When opened, they be hard to read for even a moderately sized DAG because they include a flat list of task instances that are unsorted (neither alpha nor topo).\r\n\r\n5) SLA miss emails are sent to every email address associated with the DAG. This can lead to inadvertent paging of users associated with unrelated \"forks\" in the DAG from where the SLA miss failed.\r\n\r\n6) SLA emails are not callbacks, and can't be turned off (other than either removing the SLA or removing the email attribute on the task instance).\r\n\r\nThis patch attempts to address the above issues by making some of the following changes:\r\n\r\n1) The `sla=` parameter is split into:\r\n`expected_start`: Timedelta after execution date, representing when this task must have started by.\r\n`expected_finish`: Timedelta after execution date, representing when this task must have finished by.\r\n`expected_duration`: Timedelta after task start, representing how long this task is expected to run, including all retries.\r\n\r\nThese parameters are set on a task (or DAG-level default args), and a task can have any combination of them, though there is some basic validation logic to warn you if you try to set an illogical combination. The SlaMiss object stores the type of SLA miss as a new database field, which is a component of the primary key.\r\n\r\nThere is logic to convert the existing `sla=` parameter to `expected_finish` (as well as a migration), since that's the closest parallel, so it should be relatively backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n2) SLA misses are no longer grouped for checks or callbacks. While there have always been independent per-task SlaMiss objects, there was a lot of logic to poll for all SlaMisses that occurred at the same time, and to batch them into a single email.\r\n\r\n3) As a consequence of 2), The `sla_miss_callback` is no longer set on the DAG level, which has been confusing. It now has a context-based signature to be consistent with other task callbacks. This change is not backwards compatible for anyone using custom SLA miss callbacks, but should be a fairly straightforward conversion.\r\n\r\n4) The SLA miss email is now the default SLA miss callback on tasks. Previously it was an additional non-overrideable feature.\r\n\r\n5) The SLA miss email has some improvements:\r\n- Only one SLA miss per email\r\n- SLA-miss-specific title\r\n- Includes a link to the task instance\r\n- Only includes potentially-blocked downstreams\r\n- Sends to a list of \"interested subscribers\", which is defined as all email addresses on tasks downstream of the task that missed its SLA.\r\n- Additional ASCII art to help distinguish emails.\r\n\r\n6) Move the SLA miss code largely out of the Scheduler code: some into models (DAGs manage their own SlaMiss objects), and some into SLA helper functions. \r\n\r\n7) Overall, attempt to reduce the complexity and lack of documentation of the SLA miss logic, given the constraint that the new implementation is a larger feature and more lines of code. The previous implementation was stuffed into one overloaded function that is responsible for checking for SLA misses, creating database objects for them, filtering tasks, selecting emails, rendering, and sending. These are now broken into multiple functions, which attempt to be more single-purpose.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nI have rewritten the existing tests to match this patch; I am open to adding any required additional tests. (The tests probably also want to be moved out of the scheduler suite.)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n\r\n(Sort of - I still need to rewrite the high-level, on-website SLA documentation if this gets approved.)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\n(except for a part I did not touch, and the core alembic migration template generating flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdds an \"annotation\" field to the KubernetesExecutorConfig so annotations can be specified without hardcoding.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo Kubernetes testing suite exists, afaik. Happy to add them if there is a place for them.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2711) \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe zendesk api usually returns its results in a key in the json response with the same name as the endpoint, one exception being the search endpoint, which returns its results in 'results' instead of 'search'. This special-cases that endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nnone of the other service-specific API hooks have tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-03T23:08:53Z","updated_at":"2018-11-08T22:08:15Z","closed_at":"2018-11-08T22:08:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6746678a14923aec8817ee14d7cd90cb13c3b9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Add support for labels for the bigquery_operator](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2704) issue\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Adding labels to the bigquery operator makes it much easier to track cost on these operations when running in GCP \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n   - test_bigquery_hook.TestLabelsInRunJob\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n  - Can't run the command flake8. Should probably add a script to run this and install the relevant dependencies to do so.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-03T11:24:23Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T13:00:33Z","closed_at":"2018-07-17T13:00:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe2b231639b04f70e2aa0e09dff1af22c667d0ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/2a02cc76d2bb1262aa728e4913d13ec264256a7a","head":{"label":"mastoj:AIRFLOW-2704","ref":"AIRFLOW-2704","sha":"2a02cc76d2bb1262aa728e4913d13ec264256a7a","user":{"login":"mastoj","id":501424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTQyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/501424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj","html_url":"https://github.com/mastoj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139359213,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzkzNTkyMTM=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"mastoj/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mastoj","id":501424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTQyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/501424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj","html_url":"https://github.com/mastoj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mastoj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mastoj/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2691) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn an effort to simplify the JS dependencies of Airflow, it introduces the `npm` and `webpack` for the package management. For now, it only implements this in the www_rbac version of the web server. \r\nThe problem with the frontend (js) code of Airflow is that most of the custom JS is written in the html files, using the Flask's (Jinja) variables in that JS. The next step of this effort would be to extract that custom .js code in separate JS files, and use the dependencies in those files using `require` or `import`. (At the moment, I'm simply using the CopyWebPackPlugin to copy the required dependencies for use)\r\nThere are also some dependencies which are directly modified in the codebase. I couldn't found the npm versions of those libraries. (**dagre-d3.js** and **gantt-chart-d3v2.js**). Apparently dagre-d3.js that we are using is one of the gist or is very old version, while the gantt-chart-d3v2 has been modified according to Airflow's requirements. \r\nThis PR also adds a new command while making a build for distribution i.e., `compile_assets`. The details of the command and usage has also been added in the dev documentation here: https://github.com/verdan/incubator-airflow/blob/b5a975f2afb4e29063ccfb17343ee07e5363cacb/dev/README.md\r\n(Someone need to update the release process documentation on Confluence/Wiki as I don't have access to edit or comment on [this page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Releasing+Airflow#ReleasingAirflow-PublishingtoPyPi))\r\n\r\nNext Steps: \r\n- Extract custom JS from html files, and put them in separate JS files. \r\n- Introduce eslint, and test cases for JS code. \r\n\r\n_NOTE: This webpack/npm setup is pretty much same as Apache's Superset._ \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-03T10:27:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T20:02:13Z","closed_at":"2018-07-22T07:25:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cc2d2d6599ca307aeb3bbaa12439dc7cf03adb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f48599bfb07fa4db584afc25d64cfafe4fba72cd","head":{"label":"verdan:AIRFLOW-2691-npm-webpack","ref":"AIRFLOW-2691-npm-webpack","sha":"f48599bfb07fa4db584afc25d64cfafe4fba72cd","user":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137076822,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcwNzY4MjI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"verdan/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/verdan/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2709) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] This PR enhances the error handling in the Databricks hook (and in its corresponding operator). The PR adds the capability to wait between requests, and it adds support to handle a TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE error. This error is neither a connection nor timeout error, and thus it is not correctly handled by the current hook implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds a unit test to specifically test the new functionality in the hook, and modifies existing tests in the operator to ensure the hook is initialized correctly.","created_at":"2018-07-02T21:53:01Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T07:26:29Z","closed_at":"2018-08-29T07:26:29Z","merged_at":"2018-08-29T07:26:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"255355d690302a564bbedf26dd4e8edbdbb27ee6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3570/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3570/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3570/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fdec2d00b54444ae0b4d2ebdf35aaff6db15c340","head":{"label":"betabandido:feature/databricks-retry-delay","ref":"feature/databricks-retry-delay","sha":"fdec2d00b54444ae0b4d2ebdf35aaff6db15c340","user":{"login":"betabandido","id":5481662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODE2NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5481662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido","html_url":"https://github.com/betabandido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139466512,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk0NjY1MTI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"betabandido/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"betabandido","id":5481662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODE2NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5481662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido","html_url":"https://github.com/betabandido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betabandido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/betabandido/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2706\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRather than inspecting the state of job attempts, the operator should use the top-level job status\r\nto determine the overall success or failure of the task. This means the following cases are handled\r\ncorrectly:\r\n\r\n1. Any infrastructure failure that results in no attempts being performed is now detected.\r\n2. Any retry policy that AWS Batch will do is now honored -- the job isn't marked `FAILED` until all\r\n   attempts to retry have failed. Previously, the first failed *attempt* would make the task as\r\n   failed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`","created_at":"2018-07-02T15:38:25Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T20:30:57Z","closed_at":"2018-07-06T20:30:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b2302a2bcd21b2e576c502df188707cfa9aa91bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5339682d3c74409ec07bbae9305bcf332e657717","head":{"label":"craigforster:master","ref":"master","sha":"5339682d3c74409ec07bbae9305bcf332e657717","user":{"login":"craigforster","id":772555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjU1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster","html_url":"https://github.com/craigforster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139075461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzkwNzU0NjE=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"craigforster/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"craigforster","id":772555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjU1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster","html_url":"https://github.com/craigforster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigforster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/craigforster/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2691) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn an effort to simplify the JS dependencies of Airflow, it introduces the `npm` and `webpack` for the package management. For now, it only implements this in the www_rbac version of the web server. \r\nThe problem with the frontend (js) code of Airflow is that most of the custom JS is written in the html files, using the Flask's (Jinja) variables in that JS. The next step of this effort would be to extract that custom .js code in separate JS files, and use the dependencies in those files using `require` or `import`. (At the moment, I'm simply using the CopyWebPackPlugin to copy the required dependencies for use)\r\nThere are also some dependencies which are directly modified in the codebase. I couldn't found the npm versions of those libraries. (**dagre-d3.js** and **gantt-chart-d3v2.js**). Apparently dagre-d3.js that we are using is one of the gist, while the gantt-chart-d3v2 has been modified according to Airflow's requirements. \r\n\r\nNext Steps: \r\n- Extract custom JS from html files, and put them in separate JS files. \r\n- Introduce eslint, and test cases for JS code. \r\n\r\n_NOTE: This webpack/npm setup is pretty much same as Apache's Superset._ \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-02T14:13:22Z","updated_at":"2018-09-06T11:21:47Z","closed_at":"2018-07-02T21:13:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4dc791b69ec04dd4928a2f566af763ff61d88a0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3566/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3566/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3566/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a46cec2207e74a4c96b92fe54b0e3d6092ec3245","head":{"label":"verdan:AIRFLOW-2691-npm-webpack","ref":"AIRFLOW-2691-npm-webpack","sha":"a46cec2207e74a4c96b92fe54b0e3d6092ec3245","user":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137076822,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcwNzY4MjI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"verdan/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"verdan","id":25360476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzYwNDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25360476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan","html_url":"https://github.com/verdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/verdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/verdan/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2702\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently if airflow.cfg has [scheduler/statsd_on] set to True, but doesn't have the statsd package installed it will error and crash the process, stopping it from proceeding. Also if you have an invalid hostname in your config file it will crash upon trying to getaddrinfo() from socket. \r\n\r\nSince statsd isn't a required package it shouldn't stop the web server and scheduler from proceeding, thus this fix catches the corresponding errors, and logs the fact that we couldn't use statsd.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\nThanks!","created_at":"2018-06-30T00:03:38Z","updated_at":"2018-07-04T13:26:54Z","closed_at":"2018-07-04T13:26:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"36791e6cd32a7db52e6ecbc457c1a997b43a3734","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3564/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3564/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3564/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3081b152a931f72c56cf8b856c923cd54ba07c92","head":{"label":"Noremac201:the_spy_who_errored_me","ref":"the_spy_who_errored_me","sha":"3081b152a931f72c56cf8b856c923cd54ba07c92","user":{"login":"Noremac201","id":5100085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDAwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5100085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201","html_url":"https://github.com/Noremac201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":134597860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzQ1OTc4NjA=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Noremac201/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Noremac201","id":5100085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDAwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5100085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201","html_url":"https://github.com/Noremac201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Noremac201/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Noremac201/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2697\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the Snakebite connection used by HdfsHook with hdfs3 to add Python 3 support for the `HdfsHook`. Unfortunately, this also required some changes in dependent classes, such as the `HdfsSensor`, which directly use the underlying connection object and therefore needed to be updated for the library switch. This kind of issue could be avoided in the future by providing a clean interface which dependent classes rely on.\r\n\r\nBeside this, the `HDFSHook` class has been renamed to `HdfsHook` for a more consistent naming convention. For the same reason, the `filepath` parameter has been renamed to `file_path`. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- tests/hooks/test_hdfs_hook.py\r\n- tests/sensors/test_hdfs_sensor.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2692\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen using the AWS Batch Operator, having the `job_name` field be templated allows easier traceability in the AWS console of which jobs were triggered by which Airflow task instance.  In particular, I see using `{{ ds_nodash }}` as being used heavily in my deployments.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nUpdated existing test case to check for new field.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere is currently a bug in airflow 1.9.0 that causes last DAG runs to only be included in the UI for dags with a schedule.  Externally triggered runs are not included.  This makes it difficult for users to monitor DAGs that are exclusively externally triggered.  This small change resolves the issue.\r\n\r\nThis passes {{include_externally_triggered=True}} to {{get_last_dagrun}}.  It used to be passed in at this commit: 7c94d81c390881643f94d5e3d7d6fb351a445b72.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:  Small change that affects a UI page that doesn't have any existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2668\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\ncryptography is a recommended, but optional dependency. It was\r\nmistakenly made a hard dependency by a refactor. This restores that\r\nbehaviour (though without tests, as it's hard to test that in a\r\nunittest)\r\n\r\nIn testing this I found that running `airflow initdb` would end up\r\nprinting the \"crypto is missing\" message 15 times, making it hard to see\r\nwhat was actually going on. So I have re-worked `get_fernet()` to only\r\ncompute (and warn) once. This also makes the consuming code easier as in\r\nthe case of the dep not being installed we still have a class that\r\npresents the same interface as Fernet.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  no unit tests because it's hard/impossible to test the absence of a module in a unittest. Unless someone can suggest a way of testing this? I have tested this change in a venv.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1840\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n    The new names are in-line with Celery 4, but if anyone upgrades Airflow without following the UPDATING.md instructions (which we probably assume most people won't, not until something stops working) their workers would suddenly just start failing. That's bad.\r\n\r\n  This will issue a warning but carry on working as expected. We can remove the deprecation settings (but leave the code in config) after this release has been made.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  new tests added to tests.configuration\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2678\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently airflow doesn't include any model file for FAB. If fab is enabled, this unit test will fail(complaining fab model is removed)\r\n\r\nIMO, since all the FAB models are external, we shouldn't check those models.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following: [AIRFLOW-2659](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2659)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\nIf an infrastructure outage occurs on the Hadoop cluster, tasks that rely on those services will fail in Airflow, thereby causing SLA misses and deteriorating user confidence in Airflow (even if the outage was in another system). Only a fraction of tasks and DAGs have retries around certain operators/hooks and the retry attempts are not sufficient during an outage.\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Automatically retry failures that occur due to infrastructure issues.\r\n\r\n**High-level design:**\r\n\r\n- Retry decorator in the Hooks for easy annotation\r\n- Retry logic will be time-based (initial delay, max delay time, retry window, etc.)\r\n- Allow each Hook to determine the root-cause of the error (user, infra outage)\r\n- User-errors will be handled the way they are today.\r\n- Infra-errors will be able to retry for extended periods of time.\r\n- Configurable (optional, configurable per Hook)\r\n- Emit metrics using StatsD\r\n\r\nSee more detailed design doc in https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12928793/AIRFLOW_2659.pdf\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Unit tests passed\r\n![screen shot 2018-07-02 at 4 03 40 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/225711/42190426-e11c81de-7e11-11e8-9cad-00f2ea949116.png)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n![screen shot

allows users to choose run ids that will later allow them to filter\r\nwhile retrieving runs.\r\nResolves part of AIRFLOW-2664.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/AIRFLOW-2664) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2664\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`GET /dags/<dag_id>/dag_runs?run_id_prefix=<prefix>` will limit the\r\nresult to runs with an ID that starts with <prefix>.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a DAG that is used to provision namespaced\r\nresources, you might name the runs like\r\n`provision__$namespace__$timestamp`. You could then list runs for only a\r\ngiven namespace using this query parameter.\r\n\r\nThis could be done client-side, but the result could be huge, so it is\r\nuseful to provide server-side filtering.\r\n\r\nFiltering based on conf fields would be a more versatile solution, but I\r\ndidn't have an idea of how to cleanly do that through query parameters.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- tests/www_rbac/api/experimental/test_dag_runs_endpoint.py:TestDagRunsEndpoint:test_get_dag_runs_success_with_prefix_parameter\r\n\r\nI couldn't figure out how to run it locally. After following the steps in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, to set up a local dev environment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvirtualenv .env\r\n. .venv/bin/activate\r\npip install -e .[devel]\r\n./run_unit_tests.sh tests/www_rbac/api/experimental/test_dag_runs_endpoint.py:TestDagRunsEndpoint\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe tests fail with:\r\n```\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'unicodecsv'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI set up travis and it is still chugging away [here](https://travis-ci.org/rcorre/incubator-airflow).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n    Added to the API function docstring, I assume this is sufficient?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2648) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nProposing the change for the following reason:\r\n- hostname within a mapred_job_name does not provide very useful info--dag_id, task_id and execution_date provide good enough observability.\r\n- `Airflow HiveOperator task for` is redundant and makes it hard to parse. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/operators/hive_operator.py:HiveOperatorTest.test_mapred_job_name\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-161\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR is an attempt to finish the work started in #2657\r\n\r\nWith this change different operators would be able to customize the\r\ntask instance model view with extra links, those can be used to\r\nredirect users to systems which are out of Airflow.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to display the link on UI, and not have the backend do the external routing, I had to setup the endpoint to\r\nbe a RESTful endpoint that the frontend could ping whenever. I also wanted to handle a handful of error cases, so it returns different errors\r\nIf the URL is not whitelisted, if the URL is not provided, and there is even a way for operator to provide their own custom errors\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate the modal box to make a AJAX call for link resolutions\r\nThis gives us multiple benefits:\r\n 1. It enables us to disable links when actionable\r\n 2. It enables us to give better feedback to the user on whitelisting and errors without navigating the page\r\n 3. You can see and interact with the link as it points to it's real destination, as opposed to the airflow backend doing the routing\r\n   This let's you see where the link will resolve in advance\r\n\r\n**Note**: A lot of the changes here are duplicating UI work between `www` and `www_rbac`\r\n\r\nNew additions: \r\nYou can now see where the link will resolve in advance of clicking it:\r\n<img width=\"808\" alt=\"screenshot 2018-06-21 18 33 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3519697/41753344-be1bcd5e-7581-11e8-8764-2bc790a655b7.png\">\r\n\r\nDomains that aren't whitelisted will show a tooltip and be disabled\r\n<img width=\"627\" alt=\"screenshot 2018-06-21 18 33 36\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3519697/41753345-be304432-7581-11e8-85cd-052b4a9df0cf.png\">\r\n\r\nAn operator can set a custom error message to show up on a tooltip (for example, if a link is not yet available for some reason, e.g. A job hasn't run yet, so no logs exist)\r\n<img width=\"622\" alt=\"screenshot 2018-06-21 18 33 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3519697/41753346-be47819c-7581-11e8-99c6-c355ae2d694f.png\">\r\n\r\nI should also mention here that at Lyft, we've had this running in production for half a year, and it's been really useful so far. \r\n\r\nI will also make a follow up PR with some improvements we've made to extra_links, allowing the user to specify extra_links as plugins that will apply to all operators. We use this feature to link to some logging tools we use (Kibana)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/www/test_views.py::TestRedirect\r\ntests/www_rbac/test_views.py::TestRedirect\r\ntests/contrib/operators/test_qubole_operator.py::QuboleOperatorTest::test_get_redirect_url\r\ntests/models.py::DagTest::test_extra_links_no_affect\r\ntests/models.py::DagTest:: test_extra_links\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

behavior: When you Branch from A  e.g. the BranchPythonOperator '->' (B or C,), and you make some B '->' C as well. The current behavior is that C will be skipped even though it's a downstream task of B.\r\nTo avoid this behavior this fix will check that only tasks which are not in the downstream of the branch are skipped. I think using this behavior the BranchyPythonOperator is more useful and behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2609\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nNo UI Changes description as above\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSame tests should apply\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-21T15:40:57Z","updated_at":"2018-12-25T01:59:22Z","closed_at":"2018-12-25T01:59:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6ba0a822e1b6d2d73f985c7519fb039f80b3499","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2652\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen running ``airflow backfill`` on pythonOperator, it will do / trigger a deepcopy of the task_instance. If some objects can't be deepcopy in certain python version(e.g Protobuf in python 2.7) , an exception will be thrown. We should just do a shallow copy instead of deep copy for the object.\r\n\r\nThe pr here is to copy the ``_deepcopy__`` method in BaseOperator, but skip doing deepcopy for `op_kwargs` and `python_callable`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI can't think of a good way to test. We encounter this in our production.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2651\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a set of file system hooks (FsHooks) that implement a common interface for manipulating files on different types of file systems. For more details, see the JIRA issue above. Currently the PR implements FsHooks for FTP, HDFS3, S3, SFTP and the local file system. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- tests/hooks/fs_hooks/test_base.py\r\n- tests/hooks/fs_hooks/test_ftp.py\r\n- tests/hooks/fs_hooks/test_hdfs3.py\r\n- tests/hooks/fs_hooks/test_local.py\r\n- tests/hooks/fs_hooks/test_s3.py\r\n- tests/hooks/fs_hooks/test_sftp.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\nTODO. \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nTODO.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2650\r\n\r\n\r\n### Descriptionn\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    Correctly set the status of SchedulerJob in the DB to success or failed when max_runs or max_duration is not set.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: hard to test this bit: adds tests to tests/jobs.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-20T10:44:57Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T13:26:34Z","closed_at":"2018-06-27T20:35:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7dd65dfd241302eeca552229b0694abbc8b7b7db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5ef5e7159b70966954e06e29e21980525e8dda85","head":{"label":"ashb:scheduler-job-status","ref":"scheduler-job-status","sha":"5ef5e7159b70966954e06e29e21980525e8dda85","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2648) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nProposing the change for the following reason:\r\n- hostname within a mapred_job_name does not provide very useful info--dag_id, task_id and execution_date provide good enough observability.\r\n- `Airflow HiveOperator task for` is redundant and makes it hard to parse. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/operators/hive_operator.py:HiveOperatorTest.test_mapred_job_name\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-20T00:32:27Z","updated_at":"2018-06-22T02:38:46Z","closed_at":"2018-06-22T02:38:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3c69a6f19ac2fcf82e2a8e0d9e4b5443db31b429","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fd3a447b0378b3c5987366c2c31d65faa44868c8","head":{"label":"KevinYang21:keivn_yang_reorder_mapred","ref":"keivn_yang_reorder_mapred","sha":"fd3a447b0378b3c5987366c2c31d65faa44868c8","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":106481430,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDY0ODE0MzA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"KevinYang21/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2646\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nsetup.py has a logic to avoid installing\r\nsnakebite on Python3, but it doesn't work.\r\nThis is because the variable devel_all is\r\nnow a tuple of lists. This PR fixes\r\nthat variable to be a flat list and\r\nmakes the logic work as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo additional test since it's a fix around environmental setup. I ran pip with the fixed setup.py locally and confirmed that snakebite was not installed on Python3.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

PR is WIP. \r\nOpened this PR for community approval to use MethodView instead of developing APIs using functional views. It would help in organizing the APIs using modular approach, else our endpoints.py file will eventually grow bigger, and hard to maintain.**\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2625) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIt adds a basic functionality of an API to get all DAGs and the count using the MethodView. I still need to add the searching/filtering and ordering features for this endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2642\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\nThere are two way of syncing dags, pvc and git-sync. When we use git-sync this way, git-sync will synchronize dags to /tmp/dags directory. However the worker container command args (airflow run tutorial1 print_date 2018-06-19T07:57:15.011693+00:00 --local -sd\r\n/root/airflow/dags/dags/example_dags/tutorial1.py) are generated by the scheduler. The worker cannot find the corresponding dag, so I think the environment variable GIT_SYNC_ROOT should be consistent with dag_volume_mount_path.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2640\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nJust like a partition sensor for Hive,\r\nthis PR adds a sensor that waits for\r\na table to be created in Cassandra cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntests.contrib.hooks.test_cassandra_hook:CassandraHookTest.test_table_exists\r\ntests.contrib.sensors.test_cassandra_sensor:TestCassandraTableSensor\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8
