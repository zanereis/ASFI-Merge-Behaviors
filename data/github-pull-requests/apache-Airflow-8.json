We are handling this in the `run` endpoint as this endpoint marks \"execution\" for a task instance.\r\n\r\nFew points:\r\n- Do not clear XComs for cases when \"next_method\" is set - for deferrable and reschedule tasks\r\n- Clear Xcoms for other regular tasks\r\n- Ported unit tests from `test_taskinstance.py` - only `test_xcom_pull_different_logical_date` is pending.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### Normal DAG\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Create a normal DAG like this that doesn't push an xcom\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.providers.standard.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\n\r\ndag = DAG(\r\n    'hello_world_dag',\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n)\r\n\r\nhello_task = BashOperator(\r\n    task_id='say_hello',\r\n    bash_command='echo \"Hello World from Airflow!\"',\r\n    dag=dag,\r\n    do_xcom_push=False\r\n)\r\n\r\nhello_task\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Directly hit the API in fast api to set an xcom for the task instance to stage an older Xcom being present\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc4499d0-d105-43fc-8047-23180cdafc28)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1233\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09cd72a5-f77e-40de-b8de-4d102d11f344\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Run the dag again, the xcom will get cleared\r\n<img width=\"1233\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa2d3690-b1e4-43f9-ab2e-65e3abf00068\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### DAG with a deferred Task\r\n\r\nDAG:\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.models import BaseOperator\r\nfrom airflow.providers.standard.triggers.temporal import TimeDeltaTrigger\r\n\r\n\r\nclass XComPushDeferOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n    def execute(self, context):\r\n        context[\"ti\"].xcom_push(\"test\", \"test_value\")\r\n\r\n        self.defer(\r\n            trigger=TimeDeltaTrigger(delta=timedelta(seconds=10)),\r\n            method_name=\"next\",\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    def next(self, context, event=None):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    \"xcom_clear\", schedule=None, start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 8),\r\n) as dag:\r\n    XComPushDeferOperator(task_id=\"xcom_push\")\r\n\r\n``` (ref from https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/22931)\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Run the dag:\r\n<img width=\"1725\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f6932c0-2df5-412a-a091-9594094684ae\" />\r\n\r\n2. XComs aren't cleared, still present\r\n<img width=\"1725\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4b741a2-6356-4fae-888b-eb65d6dc0a80\" />\r\n\r\n3.

an initial Grid View to the new UI.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- expand and collapse task groups\r\n- expand and collapse all task groups (including in graph view)\r\n- basic title to show run_id/task_name and state\r\n- Click on a dag run, task name, or task instance to select\r\n- hover on a dag run, task name or task instance to see your position\r\n- All clickable areas are keyboard accessible\r\n- duration and date axes for the dag run bar graph\r\n- paginate dag runs by increments of 10 even though the limit is 25. I'm open to change this.\r\n\r\nNot included:\r\n- Full tooltips. There is an issue with Chakra v3 that tooltips in particular are much slower and so a large grid view would grind to a halt: https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/discussions/9488\r\n- Accessible state colors. Will be another PR\r\n- AutoRefresh and detecting new dag runs\r\n- Detecting selected dag run from the url and shifting the grid base date to match\r\n- Filtering by run state or type\r\n- Hovering to highlight different task states\r\n- Task name search\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1100\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 1 58 13 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcb22939-970a-4135-8ab2-fb32e2c2f634\" />\r\n<img width=\"1101\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 1 58 23 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7314dbc1-3f87-4979-a079-4a5ebeb7c568\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nI think there's still too many magic numbers to make the layout work. Which I'm happy to work on as well as performance once we confirm that we want to use the grid view in this full page modal.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-08T20:24:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T12:48:55Z","closed_at":"2025-01-25T16:03:07Z","merged_at":"2025-01-25T16:03:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"961ee6e8e73213bb174d83f5585ec236b3a541e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: New Features"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/45449\r\n\r\n### Intent\r\n\r\nWith AIP 72 coming in and for extending the task sdk to be able to write \"complete\" dags, we need to be able to interact with Airflow Variables: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/variables.html\r\n\r\nHistorically, this was done like this:\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow.models import Variable\r\n\r\n# Normal call style\r\nfoo = Variable.get(\"foo\")\r\n\r\n# Auto-deserializes a JSON value\r\nbar = Variable.get(\"bar\", deserialize_json=True)\r\n\r\n# Returns the value of default_var (None) if the variable is not set\r\nbaz = Variable.get(\"baz\", default_var=None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither at the task level or at the DAG level. Note that \"airflow.models\" is used - which is what we are removing for Airflow 3 so that user code doesn't directly interact with DB models, preventing any potential hazard to the Airflow metadata DB. Instead, some user facing interfaces will be exposed to interact with Airflow entities so that we can provide a better DAG writing experience as well as be secure and reduce any risks.\r\n\r\nThe aim here is to be able to write dags with `from airflow.sdk import Variable`\r\n\r\n### Key changes in the PR\r\n- In `definitions/variable.py` user facing interface, a \"get\" method has been introduced to fetch variables.\r\n- This \"get\" method piggybacks on` _get_variable(key)` which was introduced in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/45431\r\n- In `_get_variable`, we perform a hypothesis check, we try to import \"airflow.sdk.execution_time.task_runner import SUPERVISOR_COMMS\", if import is possible, that means we are in execution context of a task, but if it fails, we are in execution context of a dag, so we attempt to import \"airflow.dag_processing.processor import COMMS_DECODER\" instead.\r\n- There is effectively a supervisor in DAG processing too, since we extend on the same machinery for dag processing as introduced in #44972. We rely on this machinery and play around with the `_handle_requests` to pass around the VariableResult to the dag processing process. \r\n- In the dag processor's handle_requests, we interact with the DB directly without using execution API and the client, this is the core package and can freely interact with DB. The advantage this brings in is that we won't need an exeuction API server when testing DAG level stuff. Like getting variables at DAG level.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### Variable.get at dag level\r\nDAG:\r\n```\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.models.baseoperator import BaseOperator\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.sdk import Variable\r\n\r\nvalue = Variable.get(key=\"my_var\")\r\n\r\nclass CustomOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n    def execute(self, context):\r\n        print(f\"Variable defined at top level of dag has value: {value}\")\r\n\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\"example_get_variable_using_task_sdk\", schedule=None, catchup=False) as dag:\r\n    CustomOperator(task_id=\"print_top_level_variable\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nVariable:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/632a71be-e7f5-4afc-88d5-b0e47fba2aab)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen variable

message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR allows you to define the check_response option in the extra options fields of the HTTP connection so that you can disable the check globally for that connection instead of always having to pass it to each HttpOperator using that same connection id.\r\n\r\nI also took the opportunity to refactor the get_conn method of the HttpHook so you can easily override the default host and default headers in the specialized hooks so those subclasses (e.g. LivyHook or DingdingHook) don't need to override the get_conn method anymore, otherwise as the signature has changed (e.g. added extra_options parameter) those has to be changed also and the exisiting solution wasn't DRY also, now it is.\r\n\r\nIn the past if you want to disable the response_check in the HttpHook through the HtpOperator, you had to define the HttpOperator like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalidate_custom_fields_task = HttpOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"get_data\",\r\n    method=\"GET\",\r\n    http_conn_id=\"http_conn_id\",\r\n    endpoint=\"/endpoint\",\r\n    headers={},\r\n    response_check=response_check,\r\n    extra_options={\"check_response\": False},  # allows you to use the custom response_check instead of the HttpHook buildin check\r\n    dag=dag,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow thanks to this PR, you can define the check_response globally in the extra_options of the connection, so it will be applied to each HttpOperator using that connection.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3941a28-f681-424a-96c2-907d207fe7b2)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

Added a minimal `Variable` user-facing definition which will be used in DAG files by DAG authors\r\n2. Added logic to get Variables in the context - both in \"value\" and \"json\" format\r\n- \"value\" is the raw form\r\n- \"json\" is the deserialised json form, we are trying to keep the contract between SDK and API server simple, they interact only in strings and the responsibility of serialising + deserialising lies on the client before sending it to the task sdk, not on the API server.

start parsing DAG bundles! This moves us away from parsing a\r\nsingle local directory to being able to parse many different bundles,\r\nincluding optional support for versioning.\r\n\r\nThis is just the basics - it keeps the parsing loop largely untouched.\r\nWe still have a single list of \"dag files\" to parse, and queue of them.\r\nHowever, instead of just a path, this list and queue now contain\r\n`DagFilePath`s, which hold both a local path and the bundle its from.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of things that are not fully functional at this\r\nstage, like versioned callbacks. These will be refactored later. There\r\nis enough churn with the basics (particularly with the number of

aims to make the interface more straightforward, removing auto inference logic from the function. Most importantly, it is now entirely the caller site's responsibility to provide valid run_id and run_type values, instead of the function automatically inferring one from the other under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main goal is to make changes simpler when we make logical date an optional (nullable) value. run_id generation is currently very heavily based on the logical date, and will need to be changed a bit when logical date is None. Removing logic should help us change the run_id generation logic easier.\r\n\r\n~~p.s. not yet ready, many tests should fail.~~ Finally ready; this took way much more than I
