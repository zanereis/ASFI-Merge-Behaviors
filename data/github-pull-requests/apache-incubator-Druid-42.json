This is enough to provide an initial implementation of #12262. \r\n\r\nThe functionality in this patch is provided as an extension. When the extension is loaded:\r\n\r\n- Broker endpoint `/druid/v2/sql/task` is added, and accepts SQL SELECT, INSERT, and REPLACE statements. The EXTERN function is usable through this endpoint.\r\n- Task types `query_controller` and `query_worker` are added. These provide the runtime for SQL queries submitted to the new endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Notes for reviewers\r\n\r\nDeveloper notes are at: https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/multi-stage-query-tasks/extensions-core/multi-stage-query/README.md. Please refer to this doc for a description of the key classes and concepts.\r\n\r\n### Try this at home\r\n\r\nYou can try this out yourself. First, build Druid from this branch and run `bin/start-micro-quickstart`. Then, save the following content to `insert.json`. (Human-readable version: https://gist.github.com/gianm/9183b1fdecdb3e9894a344c40bcb7d4a).\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": \"REPLACE INTO \\\"kttm_simple\\\"\\nOVERWRITE ALL\\nWITH kttm_data AS (\\nSELECT * FROM TABLE(\\n  EXTERN(\\n    '{\\\"type\\\":\\\"http\\\",\\\"uris\\\":[\\\"https://static.imply.io/data/kttm/kttm-v2-2019-08-25.json.gz\\\"]}',\\n    '{\\\"type\\\":\\\"json\\\"}',\\n    '[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"timestamp\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"agent_category\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"agent_type\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"browser\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"browser_version\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"city\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"continent\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"country\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"version\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"event_type\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"event_subtype\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"loaded_image\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"adblock_list\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"forwarded_for\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"language\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"number\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"long\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"os\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"path\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"platform\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"referrer\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"referrer_host\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"region\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"remote_address\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"screen\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"session\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"session_length\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"long\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"timezone\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"timezone_offset\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"long\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"window\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"}]'\\n  )\\n))\\n\\nSELECT\\n  FLOOR(TIME_PARSE(\\\"timestamp\\\") TO MINUTE) AS __time,\\n  session,\\n  agent_category,\\n  agent_type,\\n  browser,\\n  browser_version,\\n  MV_TO_ARRAY(\\\"language\\\") AS \\\"language\\\",\\n  os,\\n  city,\\n  country,\\n  forwarded_for AS ip_address\\nFROM kttm_data\\nWHERE os = 'iOS'\\nPARTITIONED BY HOUR\\nCLUSTERED BY browser, session\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the curl command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -H'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @insert.json  http://localhost:8888/druid/v2/sql/task\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll get a task ID back. When the task finishes, the datasource `kttm_simple` will have been created.\r\n\r\n### Current state of the extension\r\n\r\nFuture PRs (by other people 🙂) will add a web console UI and documentation, rounding out the feature.\r\n\r\nOnce this patch and the web console and docs changes are in place, I believe SQL INSERT and REPLACE functionality would be ready for prime time with one caveat. Fault tolerance isn't yet implemented, so if one worker task fails, the entire query fails. I think this is OK for many batch ingest use cases, but of course isn't OK for all of them. Fault tolerance is one of the areas we'll want to work on next.\r\n\r\nSQL SELECT functionality has a couple of additional caveats, beyond the lack of fault tolerance. One is that results are stored in the task report, which isn't partitioned, so it becomes a bottleneck for very large resultsets. Another is that there is no caching for Druid segments, sot hey must be downloaded anew on each query. But the SELECT functionality _does work_! Try it; it's fun. I like doing COUNT DISTINCT queries with `useApproximateCountDistinct: false` and topN-style queries with `useApproximateTopN: false` on high-cardinality columns. These queries generate a ton of intermediate data, and are a good exercise for the multi-stage system.\r\n\r\nThis patch was developed at Imply, partially by me, but also partially by others such as @cryptoe, @LakshSingla, @adarshsanjeev, and @paul-rogers. I'm looking forward to seeing where we take this in the open source project 🙂","created_at":"2022-08-18T06:20:19Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:07:30Z","closed_at":"2022-08-24T01:44:02Z","merged_at":"2022-08-24T01:44:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"d7d15ba51f15f15ac438a05172c6e83e4702f166","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design Review","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4418928415,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAGEErM8AAAABB2N_Hw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20MSQ","name":"Area - MSQ","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"For multi stage queries - https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12262"}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Description\r\nWhile putting together a PR to document the `virtualColumns` support added to native search queries in #12720, i noticed that none of the native queries had this documented, so I added

This was done to simplify the testing logic for the serialization as well as extract the responsibility of serialization to the separate class.\r\n\r\nThe logic builds `ObjectNode` incrementally based on the event `.toMap` method. Parsing each entry individually ensures that the Jackson polymorphic annotations are respected.

Description\r\nThis PR adjusts array handling in the direction of standardizing the representations on `Object[]` as well as `long[]`, `double[]`, and `float[]`. This is follow-up to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12498#discussion_r941829087 and a follow-up discussion I had with @gianm.\r\n\r\nThe main changes are removing the remaining leaks of typed object arrays such as `Long[]`, `Double[]`, and `Float[]` from the expression system, as well as adding support for handling arrays of java primitives such as `long[]`, `float[]`, and `double[]`. Expressions do not produce these primitive arrays, but aggregators and post-aggs can.\r\n\r\nI've added javadocs to try to help provide additional details on native type matters.\r\n\r\nI've adjusted the behavior of the expression column value selector when the virtual column output type is `STRING` to behave a bit more like a normal multi-value string column, and return the value directly when there is only a single value contained in the list. This does slightly change scan query results, which for multi-value string expressions would always produce array typed results, but now will produce a mix of array and scalar values. I think this behavior is more consistent with how the multi-value string columns themselves behave, but I can put it behind a flag if anyone is worried about this change.\r\n\r\nI encountered a bug with `array_slice` output type inference, which was not indicating its output as array output, instead reporting the output type of its argument. This issue became clear due to the stronger separation between multi-value string handling and array handling that now occurs in the expression selectors.\r\n\r\nSeveral redundant uses of `NullHandling.emptyToNullIfNeeded` have been removed from expression selectors, since it is baked into `StringExprEval` itself:\r\n```\r\n    private StringExprEval(@Nullable String value)\r\n    {\r\n      super(NullHandling.emptyToNullIfNeeded(value));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a follow-up PR, I'm going to try to see if I can remove the rest of the representation of ARRAY types as List, which is primarily the grouping engine.

#12845 converted `SqlLifecycle` into a set of statement classes. The `DirectStatement` class combined planning and execution into a single `execute()` method. However, it turns out that a consumer outside of the Druid code base had need to separate the plan portion of the operation from execution.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides that separation in the form of a `ResultSet` class that holds onto the \"physical plan\" (such as it is in Druid) and does the execution step. The previous `execute()` method still exists for the code, within Druid, that uses the all-in-one approach.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nWhile debugging a cluster, I found that during an overlord switch, the tasks were failing. \r\n\r\nThe task log showed \r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.druid.rpc.RpcException: Service [overlord] issued too many redirects\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.rpc.ServiceClientImpl$1.onSuccess(ServiceClientImpl.java:203)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.rpc.ServiceClientImpl$1.onSuccess(ServiceClientImpl.java:168)\r\n\tat com.google.common.util.concurrent.Futures$4.run(Futures.java:1181)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich lead me to debug the overlord redirect code. \r\n\r\nThe `RedirectFilter` on the overlord checks if the current node is the elected leader and is initialized using `TaskMaster.isLeader()` and if no, redirect it to the elected leader using `overlordLeaderSelector.getCurrentLeader()`. \r\n\r\nNow the `redirectFilter` was redirecting requests to itself resulting in a never-ending loop until the initialized flag is set hence causing `issued too many redirects` for the clients.\r\n\r\nNote that the new leader may take some time to set the initialized flag as it has to fetch tasks/locks from the metadatastore. \r\n\r\nAdjusted the code in such a way that the `redirectFilter` will not redirect the requests to itself resulting in a `SC_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE = 503` which will cause the overlord clients to back off exponentially which IMHO is the correct behaviour. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

has traditionally supported just one kind of SQL statement: `SELECT`. The planner was thus designed to process \"a query\", and an ever-increasing amount of conditional code was added to support other statements such as `INSERT` and `REPLACE`. As we look toward adding DDL statements, the current approach will become unworkable. Other SQL products introduce an additional layer to handle statement types: the *statement handler*. This PR adds statement handlers to Druid.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the [single-pass planner](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12636) PR to heavily refactor the Druid planner to split statement-specific code into a set of statement-specific handler classes. All handlers implement a simple interface:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface SqlStatementHandler\r\n{\r\n  SqlNode sqlNode();\r\n  void validate() throws ValidationException;\r\n  Set<ResourceAction> resourceActions();\r\n  void prepare();\r\n  PrepareResult prepareResult();\r\n  PlannerResult plan() throws ValidationException;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe details of what is needed for each statement is a (complex) implementation detail of the handler classes.\r\n\r\nAt present, all the SQL statements which Druid supports include a `SELECT`: `EXPLAIN`, `INSERT`, `REPLACE` and, of course, `SELECT` itself. To reflect this fact, a base `QueryHandler` class handles the common aspects. As we add other statements (such as DDL), completely new handlers will handle those cases.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the code is identical between `master` and this PR, but the code is heavily refactored and shifted around.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a step toward modifying the SQL validator to handle the newer `INSERT` and `REPLACE` nodes. The validation logic for these two statements that migrated to handers in this PR will migrate again into a Druid version of the Calcite validator.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a redo of an earlier one that did this same work. This version incorporates the many planner changes done recently.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-16T06:33:40Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:16:50Z","closed_at":"2022-09-19T06:28:45Z","merged_at":"2022-09-19T06:28:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ce03eb094d6723b831ac03a067e2c4e3cf499fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

was possible for `manageInternal` to relaunch a task while it was\r\nbeing cleaned up, due to a race that happens when `notifyStatus` is\r\ncalled to clean up a successful task:\r\n\r\n1) In a critical section, `notifyStatus` removes the task from `tasks`.\r\n2) Outside a critical section, `notifyStatus` calls `taskRunner.shutdown`\r\n   to let the task runner know it can clear out its data structures.\r\n3) In a critical section, `syncFromStorage` adds the task back to `tasks`,\r\n   because it is still present in metadata storage.\r\n4) In a critical section, `manageInternalCritical` notices that the task\r\n   is in `tasks` and is not running in the `taskRunner`, so it launches\r\n   it again.\r\n5) In a (different) critical section, `notifyStatus` updates the metadata\r\n   store to set the task status to SUCCESS.\r\n6) The task continues running even though it should not be.\r\n\r\nThe possibility for this race was introduced in #12099, which shrunk\r\nthe critical section in `notifyStatus`. Prior to that patch, a single\r\ncritical section encompassed (1), (2), and (5), so the ordering above\r\nwas not possible.\r\n\r\nThis patch does the following:\r\n\r\n1) Fixes the race by adding a `recentlyCompletedTasks` set that prevents\r\n   the main management loop from doing anything with tasks that are\r\n   currently being cleaned up.\r\n2) Switches the order of the critical sections in `notifyStatus`, so\r\n   metadata store updates happen first. This is useful in case of\r\n   server failures: it ensures that if the Overlord fails in the midst\r\n   of `notifyStatus`, then completed-task statuses are still available in\r\n   ZK or on MMs for the next Overlord. (Those are cleaned up by\r\n   `taskRunner.shutdown`, which formerly ran first.) This isn't related\r\n   to the race described above, but is fixed opportunistically as part\r\n   of the same patch.\r\n3) Changes the `tasks` list to a map. Many operations require retrieval\r\n   or removal of individual tasks; those are now O(1) instead of O(N)\r\n   in the number of running tasks.\r\n4) Changes various log messages to use task ID instead of full task\r\n   payload, to make the logs more readable.","created_at":"2022-08-14T06:42:28Z","updated_at":"2022-09-04T20:53:28Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T06:34:37Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T06:34:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"28836dfa71d0bf9baac5512fb86bd40c5ea51c46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2717749995,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE3NzQ5OTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Ingestion","name":"Area - Ingestion","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Description\r\nThis PR switches `TO_JSON_STRING` and `PARSE_JSON` functions to use the `@Json` annotated `ObjectMapper` to better tie into the standard JSON serde we use for result formats, as mentioned as an alternative to solving the problem in #12893 (we should do both).\r\n\r\nThis allows a much wider variety of complex types to be translated into strings using `TO_JSON_STRING`, many of these likely just being turned into base64 string values, but now they at least work instead of failing with an error such as\r\n\r\n ```\r\nUnable to stringify

for introducing an indexing-service-task-based SQL engine\r\nunder the umbrella of #12262. Also includes some other changes related\r\nto improving error behavior.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n1) Elevate the QueryMakerFactory interface (an extension point that allows\r\n   customization of how queries are made) into SqlEngine. SQL engines\r\n   can influence planner behavior through EngineFeatures, and can fully\r\n   control the mechanics of query execution using QueryMakers.\r\n\r\n2) Remove the server-wide QueryMakerFactory choice, in favor of the choice\r\n   being made by the SQL entrypoint. The indexing-service-task-based\r\n   SQL engine would be associated with its own entrypoint, like\r\n   /druid/v2/sql/task.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n1) Adjust DruidPlanner to try either DRUID or BINDABLE convention based\r\n   on analysis of the planned rels; never try both. In particular, we\r\n   no longer try BINDABLE when DRUID fails. This simplifies the logic\r\n   and improves error messages.\r\n\r\n2) Adjust error message \"Cannot build plan for query\" to omit the SQL\r\n   query text. Useful because the text can be quite long, which makes it\r\n   easy to miss the text about the problem.\r\n\r\n3) Add a feature to block context parameters used internally by the SQL\r\n   planner from being supplied by end users.\r\n\r\n4) Add a feature to enable adding row signature to the context for\r\n   Scan queries. This is useful in building the task-based engine.\r\n\r\n5) Add saffron.properties file that turns off sets and graphviz dumps\r\n   in \"cannot plan\" errors. Significantly reduces log spam on the Broker.","created_at":"2022-08-12T10:04:22Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:08:02Z","closed_at":"2022-08-15T06:31:20Z","merged_at":"2022-08-15T06:31:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c5a43106a1f7d0b0258b943c51b93c52563e9ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area - SQL","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4418928415,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAGEErM8AAAABB2N_Hw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20MSQ","name":"Area - MSQ","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"For multi stage queries - https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12262"}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

a part of the fix in #11517, a couple of cases are missing : \r\n1. where if a join is fully converted into filter\r\n2. where if an independent filter on the base table is carried to the join\r\n\r\nIn both cases we should convey that the storage adapter might have built-in filters. \r\nIt might be the case that the outer query doesn't have any filters, so to inform the topN query engine that the scan is not on the full segment, we need to convey it via the join's storage adapter. This will help the topN query engine in taking decision whether to short circuit the scan or not.\r\n\r\nThis was uncovered when the existing test for `CalciteQueryTest#testExactTopNOnInnerJoinWithLimit` started failing as a part of #12868\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a bug with `JSON_OBJECT` not unwrapping all value objects, which can result in `StructuredData` appearing in the resulting object. This is problematic if the value is used with `TO_JSON_STRING`, which is currently using a default object mapper which doesn't know how to serialize `StructuredData`, causing a failure.\r\n\r\nWhile it might be a good idea to determine how to use the `@Json` `ObjectMapper` we use everywhere for `to_json_string`, it was also unintentional that `json_object` wasn't \"unwrapping\" `StructuredData` from the inputs to its value arguments, so I've fixed that part in this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-11T23:21:17Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:08:09Z","closed_at":"2022-08-14T04:15:19Z","merged_at":"2022-08-14T04:15:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4e0909e924dc24539857ada817cbd0cfdacd729","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If operators are going to use `http` server view, why waste the space in zookeeper announcing segments?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure on formatting here. I put it in it's own  table since it renders the configs in the above table irrelevant. I can change it however we see fit.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that occurs when using a `SUM` function in sub-query that is a result of a bug in the version of Calcite that we are using in `SqlSplittableAggFunction.AbstractSumSplitter`. Queries impacted will be of this form and involve INTEGER (or FLOAT) literals:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  dim1,\r\n  SUM(CASE WHEN sum_l1 = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS outer_l1\r\nfrom (\r\n  select\r\n    dim1,\r\n    SUM(l1) as sum_l1\r\n  from numfoo\r\n  group by dim1\r\n)\r\ngroup by 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is described by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4609 and was fixed by https://github.com/apache/calcite/commit/c96d85ccad32cbdc9b52b5e2488887ed14a1b5ec.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises because `RelDataTypeSystem` implementations are allowed to define the built-in `SUM` function return type inference via [`deriveSumType`](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/planner/DruidTypeSystem.java#L102) which we have done, however in our version [`AggregateRemoveRule`](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/branch-1.21/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/rel/rules/AggregateRemoveRule.java#L112) attempts to simplify the query using `SqlSplittableAggFunction.singleton`, which \"Generates an expression for the value of the aggregate function when applied to a single row.\" in this case, to compare the subquery signature to the outer signature to see if it can remove the outer aggregate (and eventually collapse the outer and inner query).\r\n\r\nThe default [implementation of this for `SUM`](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/branch-1.21/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/sql/SqlSplittableAggFunction.java#L263) however just passes through the argument as the output, which in this case is an `INTEGER` literal, instead of a `BIGINT` which the Druid type system would have chosen if it was consulted.\r\n\r\nThis is the part of the bug, and for my fix I have duplicated `SqlSumAggFunction` as `DruidSumAggFunction` and overwritten `unwrap` to use a new `DruidSumSplitter` which checks to see if the type of the `aggregateCall` is the same as the type of the argument, otherwise it will wrap the identifier in a cast expression to ensure it is the correct type.\r\n\r\nWithout this, the query planning fails with an error like\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: Type mismatch:\r\nrowtype of new rel:\r\nRecordType(VARCHAR dim2, BIGINT NOT NULL outer_l2) NOT NULL\r\nrowtype of set:\r\nRecordType(VARCHAR dim2, INTEGER NOT NULL $f1) NOT NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is already fixed upstream, where [`AggregateRemoveRule`](https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/main/core/src/main/java/org/apache/calcite/rel/rules/AggregateRemoveRule.java#L112) now ensures that the output of `singleton` is the correct type or casts it, which is basically what I've done here. We will no longer need this change once we can upgrade to a newer version of Calcite.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T02:19:20Z","updated_at":"2022-12-01T16:03:30Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T22:17:45Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T22:17:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"ee41cc770f3a2b666e380d25ffbc5469a42a1d36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area - SQL","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Description\r\nThis PR should serve as a simple example of how to do entire column storage\r\nwhich uses delta encoding as well as block compression (default LZ4).\r\n\r\nDiscussion:\r\nThis implementation was designed and discussed with @cheddar  offline.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n-Add classes for writing cell values in LZ4 block compressed format.\r\nPayloads are indexed by element number for efficient random lookup\r\n-update SerializablePairLongStringComplexMetricSerde to use block\r\ncompression\r\n-SerializablePairLongStringComplexMetricSerde also uses delta encoding\r\nof the Long by doing 2-pass encoding: buffers first to find min/max\r\nnumbers and delta-encodes as integers if possible\r\n\r\nEntry points for doing block-compressed storage of byte[] payloads \r\nare the CellWriter and CellReader class. See \r\nSerializablePairLongStringComplexMetricSerde for how these are used\r\nalong with how to do full column-based storage (delta encoding here)\r\nwhich includes 2-pass encoding to compute a column header\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * CellReader\r\n * CellWriter\r\n * SerializablePairLongStringComplexMetricSerde \r\n * SerializablePairLongStringColumnSerializer\r\n * SerializablePairLongStringComplexColumn\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Storage Efficiency Improvement Measurement\r\n\r\nThe following shows a comparison of before and after on the simple\r\nwikipedia edits dataset.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR attempts to fix a few flaky tests and add more information to the assertion failure message\r\n\r\n- SeekableStreamSupervisorStateTest - Tests in this class rely on a latch to know when a metric has been emitted. However, the latch is counted down for all the emitted metrics and not just the metric we want to test the emission of. This is why tests wait for the latch to be counted down twice. Except in one place, probably by accident, and that was a flaky test. Now with this change, we wait for latch to be released only for the metric being tested. I am also using the same latch mechanism to track emission of `notice time` metric (that was another flaky test)\r\n- ITTLS test - We now retry requests for ClosedChannelException errors as well. This *may* fix the flakiness. \r\n- Added more information to the assertion failure message in IndexTaskTest and CompactionTaskParallelRunTest. \r\n- AbstractQueryResourceTestClient - Added retries for running queries. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-08T13:50:47Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:07:55Z","closed_at":"2022-08-16T13:08:04Z","merged_at":"2022-08-16T13:08:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"adbebc174ab56bf9605658e80045dda3fe4ec527","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area - Testing","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn the current druid code base, we have the interface `DataSegmentPusher` which allows us to push segments to the appropriate deep storage without the extension being worried about the semantics of how to push too deep storage. \r\n\r\nWhile working on #12262, whose some part of the code will go as an extension, I realized that we do not have an interface that allows us to do basic \"write, get, delete, deleteAll\" operations on the appropriate deep storage without let's say pulling the `s3-storage-extension` dependency in the custom extension. \r\n\r\n\r\nHence, the idea of `StorageConnector` was born where the storage connector sits inside the druid core so all extensions have access to it. \r\n\r\nEach deep storage implementation, for eg s3, GCS, will implement this interface. \r\nNow with some Jackson magic, we bind the implementation of the correct deep storage implementation on runtime using a type variable. \r\n\r\nFrom the javadocs : \r\n```\r\nLow level interface for interacting with different storage providers like S3, GCS, Azure and local file system.\r\nFor adding a new implementation of this interface in your extension extend {@link StorageConnectorProvider}.\r\nFor using the interface in your extension as a consumer, use JsonConfigProvider like:\r\n 1. JsonConfigProvider.bind(binder, \"druid,extension.custom.type\", StorageConnectorProvider.class, Custom.class);\r\n // bind the storage config provider\r\n 2. binder.bind(Key.get(StorageConnector.class, Custom.class)).toProvider(Key.get(StorageConnectorProvider.class, Custom.class)).in(LazySingleton.class);\r\n // Use Named annotations to access the storageConnector instance in your custom extension.\r\n 3. @Custom StorageConnector storageConnector\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the future, we should clean up the `DataSegmentPuller, DataSementPusher` implementations to also use this low-level storage connector.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of the PR, S3StorageConnector implementation is provided which uses the s3 multi-part upload APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks, @jihoonson for helping out in the RetriableS3OutputStream implementation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with `JSONFlattenerMaker` leaking Jackson `JsonNode` types into `InputRow`, similar to what is going on in #12828. Handling for boolean and binary `JsonNode` types has been added to now return them as `Boolean` and `byte[]`, and now by default we will return a String value by calling `asText`, which should return something at least for all value nodes. Binary is probably not necessary as it is a Jackson thing that I think we'd be unlikely to see on input data, and in my tests with `byte[]` the values ended up as base64 strings in `TextNode` but I added it just in case.\r\n\r\nI also adjusted the `valueConversionFunction` into the implementation of `finalizeConversionForMap`, which is used when converting nested data rows to plain java maps for the sampler, though this change was less necessary I think because nothing really tries to process these directly they just get serialized in the sampler response.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-06T20:32:11Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:08:27Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T02:51:57Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T02:51:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"a7e89de6107ee77cd8a3c2760deb37642db79225","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2717749995,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE3NzQ5OTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Ingestion","name":"Area - Ingestion","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

change adds the query/time metric for SQL queries from router. Currently, the native queries do report that metric whereas the SQL queries don't. The biggest problem in support SQL query metrics is that in router the SQL query doesn't have a native query plan which can be used to send metrics. \r\nSo, instead we extract `sqlQueryId` from the query response header and only set that dimension for query/time metric for SQL queries. Due to the lack of a native translated query, we use a dummy native query to interact with `QueryMetrics` interface but ensure that no dummy dimensions are set in the metric.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for not de-serializing the SQL query requests are : \r\n1. It can take time on the router which can add to the latencies of the query\r\n2. It is not possible to de-serialize the JDBC SQL queries easily (would require same structure as Avatica handlers)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Description\r\nFixes `ExpressionPlan.inferColumnCapabilities`, which is used by native `ExpressionVirtualColumn` to infer the output type from the input row signature, and can play a role in determining the output row signature of a query to correctly handle `COMPLEX` typed expressions (added in #11853). This bug could cause incorrect behavior due to this method making default `STRING` typed capabilities, causing incorrect selectors to be chosen, which for json columns whose in process values are things like java `Map` to effectively be calling `toString` on everything, which for something like `JSON_OBJECT(KEY 'a' VALUE 'A', KEY 'b' VALUE 1)` would end up with the values as strings appearing like `'{a=A, b=1}'` instead of actual JSON `{\"a\":\"A\", \"b\":1}`.\r\n\r\nThe fix is just to add a short circuit for `COMPLEX` types so that the default string capabilities are not used.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-04T03:59:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:08:42Z","closed_at":"2022-08-04T09:56:05Z","merged_at":"2022-08-04T09:56:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"73cfc4e5d0f04c4259898a32565fd80745da08b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Description\r\nFixes an issue with the cache key information used to encode ordering for top n and group by queries, which just refer to the name. However, since many agg and post-agg implementations do not add the output name to the cache key, constructing the ordering cache key information just by name is insufficient to ensure that the cached data is actually sorted in the same manner. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by appending extra cache information for the inputs of the ordering information, basically duplicating the key information of the dimspec, aggregator factory, or postagg as appropriate. Alternatively, we could have added output name to all agg and postagg cache keys, but it seems like that could result in slightly lower cache hit rate so this way seems preferable to me at least.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

Description\r\n\r\nThe `FiniteFirehoseFactory` and `InputRowParser` classes were deprecated in 0.17.0 (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8823) in favor of `InputSource` & `InputFormat`. This PR removes the `FiniteFirehoseFactory` and all its implementations along with classes solely used by them like `Fetcher` (Used by `PrefetchableTextFilesFirehoseFactory`). Refactors classes including tests using `FiniteFirehoseFactory` to use `InputSource` instead.\r\nRemoving `InputRowParser` may not be as trivial as many classes that aren't deprecated depends on it (with no alternatives), like `EventReceiverFirehoseFactory`. Hence `FirehoseFactory`, `EventReceiverFirehoseFactory`, and `Firehose` are marked deprecated.\r\n\r\n**Discussion thread:** https://lists.apache.org/thread/lq5846jy7j4kf6r379cy4gpgqzdkfsf3\r\n**Doc changes:** https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12981/files\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug in `AbstractParallelIndexSupervisorTaskTest#compareTaskReports(..)`\r\nIndexing Task tests assert generated reports are as expected using `compareTaskReports(..)`. This becomes flaky in the case of Sequential Index Task since the generated `movingAverages` field in reports varies with task execution time. This PR modifies the method to skip this field.\r\n\r\n#### Renamed the class `TestRealtimeTask` to `TestIndexTask`\r\nOnly `RemoteTaskRunnerTest` & `WorkerTaskMonitorTest` uses `RealtimeTask` currently. Modifying the name to `TestIndexTask` and implementing `IndexTask` (to use `InputSource` instead of `FirehoseFactory`) shouldn't affect both tests as they're simply testing `RemoteTaskRunner` & `WorkerTaskMonitor` functionalities, and they are task agnostic.\r\n\r\n#### Removed `ITCombiningFirehoseFactoryIndexTest`\r\nSince combining input source isn't supported by the `IndexTask` and `ITCombiningInputSourceParallelIndexTest` already exists, removing ITCombiningFirehoseFactoryIndexTest in this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Rationale for earlier `ITAutoCompactionTest`, `ITCompactionTaskTest` failures\r\nAfter modifying `wikipedia_with_timestamp_index_task.json`, `wikipedia_index_task_with_dimension_spec.json` spec from firehose to inputSource, ingestion tasks were producing 5 segments in place of expected 4. The number of segments generated was observed to be dependent on input files order (provided through the filter param). Hence changing the spec with a particular order of input files fixed it. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFixes some issues with SQL return type information of nested column functions that return `COMPLEX<json>` types.\r\n\r\nDruid native `COMPLEX` types are handled in SQL with `RowSignatures.ComplexSqlType`, which contains the native complex type name, which is a relatively recent addition. This works relatively well so far, but there were a few rough edges with how we were using it and the way that calcite works that were causing the complex type information to be lost, making the query result type header information report the types as `COMPLEX` (the \"unknown\" complex) instead of `COMPLEX<json>`. The reason for this loss of information was due to the way `ReturnTypes.explicit` type inference works, which makes a new type using the `SqlTypeName`, which would lose the Druid complex type name when it made a standard `SqlTypeName.OTHER` instead of a `RowSignatures.ComplexSqlType`. This can be fixed by implementing the return type directly. However, this made apparent another issue, which is that Calcite uses `!=` to check type equality instead of `equals`, so it is necessary to feed the `RowSignatures.ComplexSqlType` into the `RelDataTypeFactory` to ensure that the type is interned so that all of the signatures are using the same instance.\r\n\r\nIve added a new method \r\n```\r\npublic static RelDataType makeComplexType(RelDataTypeFactory typeFactory, ColumnType columnType, boolean isNullable)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich uses the `typeFactory` to ensure that the types are interned. I've also updated the javadocs to mention how to effectively use `RowSignatures.ComplexSqlType` if not using this method to try to prevent other users of this type from\r\nrunning into the same issues.\r\n\r\nI've also added some methods to `BaseCalciteQueryTest` that allow expecting the result `RowSignature` of the query being tested, and switched `CalciteNestedQueryTest` to use them to ensure that the the fixes work correctly.

to #12745. Part of #12262. This patch adds three new concepts:\r\n\r\n1) Frame channels are interfaces for doing nonblocking reads and writes\r\n   of frames.\r\n\r\n2) Frame processors are interfaces for doing nonblocking processing of\r\n   frames received from input channels and sent to output channels.\r\n\r\n3) Cluster-by keys, which can be used for sorting or partitioning.\r\n\r\nThe patch also adds SuperSorter, a user of these concepts, both to\r\nillustrate how they are used, and also because it is going to be useful\r\nin future work.\r\n\r\nCentral classes:\r\n\r\n- [ReadableFrameChannel](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frame-processor/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/channel/ReadableFrameChannel.java), nonblocking source of frames. Implementations include BlockingQueueFrameChannel (in-memory channel that implements both interfaces), ReadableFileFrameChannel (file-based channel), ReadableByteChunksFrameChannel (byte-stream-based channel), and others.\r\n\r\n- [WritableFrameChannel](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frame-processor/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/channel/WritableFrameChannel.java), nonblocking sink for frames. Implementations include BlockingQueueFrameChannel and WritableStreamFrameChannel (byte-stream-based channel).\r\n\r\n- [ClusterBy](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frame-processor/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/key/ClusterBy.java), a sorting or partitioning key.\r\n\r\n- [FrameProcessor](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frame-processor/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/processor/FrameProcessor.java), nonblocking processor of frames. Implementations include FrameChannelBatcher, FrameChannelMerger, and FrameChannelMuxer.\r\n\r\n- [FrameProcessorExecutor](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frame-processor/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/processor/FrameProcessorExecutor.java), an executor service that runs FrameProcessors.\r\n\r\n- [SuperSorter](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frame-processor/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/processor/SuperSorter.java), a class that uses frame channels and processors to do parallel external merge sort of any amount of data (as long as there is enough disk space).","created_at":"2022-08-02T08:23:21Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:08:39Z","closed_at":"2022-08-05T04:29:04Z","merged_at":"2022-08-05T04:29:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca4e64aea3951f8577f80a7aa0de6a50e83e86db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design Review","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4418928415,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAGEErM8AAAABB2N_Hw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20MSQ","name":"Area - MSQ","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"For multi stage queries - https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12262"}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n### Symptom:\r\nMappers/Reducers spawned by the 'hadoop_index` tasks on EMR cluster 6.3.xx were running in debug mode. \r\nThey were not respecting the args passed via job properties. \r\n\r\n### Solution: \r\nAs Hadoop is still on the old log4j 1.xx jars, there is some incompatibility when both log4j 1.xx and log4j 2.xx jars are present.\r\nlog4j 2.17.1 does not support log4j1.x custom levels. Hence it was defaulting to DEBUG. \r\nThis PR: https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/789​  adds the support for log4j 1.x levels. \r\nPost upgrading the jar to log4j 2.18, the mapper/reducer are picking the correct logger level ie : INFO\r\n\r\n```\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger PluginManager 'Lookup' found xx plugins\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger PluginManager 'Log4j Builder' found xx plugins\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger Parsing for [root] with value=[INFO,CLA,EventCounter].\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger Level token is [INFO].\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger Logger root level set to INFO\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger Parsing appender named \"CLA\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to check if your cluster is affected by this\r\n\r\nAdd the following properties in your ingestion spec:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"index_hadoop\",\r\n  \"spec\": {\r\n    \"dataSchema\": \"xx\",\r\n    \"ioConfig\": \"xx\",\r\n    \"tuningConfig\": {\r\n       \"xx\": \"xx\",\r\n       \"jobProperties\": {\r\n       \"mapreduce.map.java.opts\": \"-server -Dlog4j.debug=true -Dorg.apache.logging.log4j.simplelog.StatusLogger.level=TRACE\",,\r\n        \"mapreduce.reduce.java.opts\": \"-server  -Dlog4j.debug=true -Dorg.apache.logging.log4j.simplelog.StatusLogger.level=TRACE\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGrab the application id from the peon task logs. \r\n\r\nGo to yarn main nodes and do \r\n `yarn logs --applicationId xxx`\r\n\r\nIf you see output like : \r\n```\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger PluginManager 'Log4j Builder' found xx plugins\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger Parsing for [root] with value=[DEBUG,CLA,EventCounter].\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger Level token is [DEBUG].\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger Logger root level set to DEBUG\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen your mappers and reducers are running in debug mode. \r\n\r\nAnother way is to take the flame graph of the mappers/reducers and see if any code path is hitting debug sections. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

the recent changes to make a single pass through the planner, and to tidy up the JDBC semantics, we are now in a position to tighten up the semantics for SQL statement handling by replacing `SqlLifecycle` with a set of focused “statement” classes (in the sense of following JDBC statements.)\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n`SqlLifecycle` appears to have been modeled on the original native `QueryLifecycle` which represents native query. While the `QueryLifecycle` works for native queries, SQL imposes additional constraints that suggests a cleaner way to model SQL queries.\r\n\r\nIn the recent discussion around the “single-pass planner”, @clintropolis  and @gianm provided a helpful description of some of the history as to how the code came to be as it is. One of the major drivers, we discovered, was the need to handle dynamic parameters for JDBC. We discovered that the JDBC implementation made some awkward assumptions, which were fixed in the recent “Avatica” PR.\r\n\r\nWith the planner and JDBC tidied up, we are now in a position to examine `SqlLifecycle`. This class handles two distinct use cases: the \"direct\" case (like a JDBC `Statement`) where we execute a given SQL statement, and a \"prepared\" case (like JDBC `PreparedStatement`) in which we prepare a statement, then execute that statement later with parameters. With the Avatica driver cleaned up to clearly separate these two use cases, we can do the same at the `SqlLifecycle` level.\r\n\r\nSince each use case has its own class, the interfaces for the classes are simpler, either:\r\n\r\n`directStmt(sql, parameters) -> results`\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n`prepare(stmt) -> prepared_stmt`\r\n`prepared_stmt(parameters) -> results`\r\n\r\nIn the \"direct\" statements, the query is \"one and done\". But, with prepared statements (for JDBC), the prepared statement can be run any number of times, each time producing a direct statement with parameters applied.\r\n\r\n### Specific Use Cases\r\n\r\nFor HTTP, we do “direct” statement execution: we are presented with the query, context and parameters, and we make a straight shot through the planner to execution, stopping only if we encounter an error. This is the same pattern (but with somewhat different inputs) used by tests.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for JDBC, we are obligated to implement a “prepare once, execute many” model. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/prepared.html In our case, this means doing validation without parameter values (which are not yet provided by JDBC.) Then, to execute, we must replan with parameter values. Since we use a “query optimized” model, this means starting over as in the original code.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nIn traditional, non-distributed systems, the high-order view of a SQL system is that it is just a function:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nrun(sql, context) --> results\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `context` is an ad-hoc collection of data required to run a query.\r\n\r\nIn a distributed system, we often split the above into two steps:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nplan(sql, context) --> plan\r\nexec(plan, context) --> results\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe functions do have internal structure, but that is generally not important to the caller. The existing `SqlLifecycle` exposes that internal structure at each point where the caller must provide more information (such as parameter values, an auth result, etc.) If we instead take that information to be part of the `context` above, then we can simplify the interface to follow the traditional model. (Druid is distributed, but the distribution happens as a level below the SQL statement.)\r\n\r\nWhen a system supports the `PREPARE` operation, then use the second pattern above: we create an execution plan during `PREPARE` and we run the plan, with parameters, as a later step. When a system supports `EXPLAIN`, then we do only the `plan` step above, and skip the execution part. (In practice, the \"prepare result\" in Druid is not actual an execution plan, but it is close enough for our purposes.)\r\n\r\n## Restructured Classes\r\n\r\n`SqlLifecycle` is replaced with classes focused on the two use cases identified above: a “direct” statement and a “prepared” statement:\r\n\r\n* `DirectStatement`: One which implements the single-pass model, using the auth result for authentication.\r\n* `HttpStatement`: a variation of `DirectStatement` which uses the servlet request for authentication.\r\n* `PreparedStatement`: implements the prepare-once, execute-many model.\r\n\r\nThe resulting code is far simpler and easier to test. We now have a clean SQL stack for JDBC, HTTP and internal use that make a single planner pass when possible, and use two passes for the JDBC prepare/execute model.\r\n\r\nThe JDBC classes are then implemented using the statement abstractions described above. A JDBC `ResultSet` is a `DirectStatement`. A JDBC `PreparedStatement` is a Druid `PreparedStatement`. The prior JDBC-related PR did the restructuring that allows us to now map JDBC directly to Druid statements.\r\n\r\n## Secondary Changes\r\n\r\nOther supporting changes in this PR include:\r\n\r\n* The `DruidPlanner` no longer has the “reset” functionality: each planner instance is used by a single statement, only once.\r\n* The code to gather and report stats is factored out into a new `SqlExecutionReporter` class which is shared by the new statement classes.\r\n* The class to cancel queries, `SqlLifecycleManager` is refactored to use a `Cancellable` interface instead of depending on the details of `SqlLifecycle`.\r\n* `SqlToolbox` is added to hold the many knick-knacks passed from the `SqlLivecycleFactory` into statements.\r\n* The old mock-based `SqlLifecycleTest` is replace with a new `SqlStatementTest`.\r\n* `BaseCalciteQueryTest` is modified to use the `SqlQueryPlus` object introduced recently.\r\n* Many tests were updated to remove a now-unnecessary `throws` clause to keep IntelliJ inspections happy.\r\n* `PlannerConfig` us used with many variations in tests. Because there is no constructor, each variation created a subclass to change one value. A builder is added to make customizing the config easier in tests.\r\n* Initialization of the Calcite default character set has moved from code in `Calcites` into a `saffron.properties` file in the `druid-sql` project resources directory. This change avoids any possible race condition between Druid and Calcite initialization: Calcite is guaranteed to obtain properties when it initializes. The properties file is compiled into the `druid-sql` jar file and is thus guaranteed to be available in production.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThe Kafka lookup extractor has to consume an entire topic from the beginning in order to build the internal lookup map. Previously, the extractor would always use a randomly generated Kafka `group.id`. This meant that the service would register a new consumer group every time it started, essentially \"forgetting\" it's previously committed consumer offsets. This guarantees that the service will always consume the entire topic.\r\n\r\nThis has the unintended side-effect of also leaving a lot of \"ghost\" consumers registered with the Kafka cluster. These consumer groups will never be used again and so they just hang around on the broker until Kafka decides to delete them (by default, after 2 days). This needlessly adds bloat to the Kafka broker.\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed by setting the Kafka consumer config `enable.auto.commit` to `false`. This means that the consumer never attempts to commit offsets, achieving the same result as before without leaving a bunch of \"ghost\" consumer groups registered on the broker.\r\n\r\nI also took the chance to flesh out the documentation a whole bunch.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `org.apache.druid.query.lookup.KafkaLookupExtractorFactory`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

work towards #12838.\r\n\r\n1) Add a \"Java runtime\" doc page with information about supported\r\n   Java versions, garbage collection, and strong encapsulation.\r\n\r\n2) Update asm and equalsverifier to versions that support Java 17.\r\n\r\n3) Add additional \"--add-opens\" lines to surefire configuration, so\r\n   tests can pass successfully under Java 17.\r\n\r\n4) Switch openjdk15 tests to openjdk17.\r\n\r\n5) Update FrameFile to specifically mention Java runtime incompatibility\r\n   as the cause of not being able to use Memory.map.\r\n\r\n6) Update SegmentLoadDropHandler to log an error for Errors too, not\r\n   just Exceptions. This is important because an IllegalAccessError is\r\n   encountered when the correct \"--add-opens\" line is not provided,\r\n   which would otherwise be silently ignored.\r\n\r\n7) Update example configs to use druid.indexer.runner.javaOptsArray\r\n   instead of druid.indexer.runner.javaOpts. (The latter is deprecated.)\r\n\r\n8) Added a `run-java` command that sets up the proper \"--add-opens\"\r\n   and \"--add-exports\" parameters for Java 17, and update out-of-box\r\n   configs to include `druid.indexer.runner.javaCommand=bin/run-java`\r\n   so this gets used.","created_at":"2022-07-30T15:42:31Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:08:44Z","closed_at":"2022-08-04T06:16:05Z","merged_at":"2022-08-04T06:16:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"ef6811ef882bb900f6ea249389758f500cfcaf00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":606691557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDY2OTE1NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Compatibility","name":"Compatibility","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Description\r\nThis PR adds an implementation to `DictionaryEncodedStringValueIndex` to `NestedFieldLiteralColumnIndexSupplier`, which is used in a handful of places for doing stuff with dictionary encoded columns, such as native search and segment metadata queries, fixing some bugs.\r\n\r\nI also removed `getIndex` and `hasNulls` from `DictionaryEncodedStringValueIndex`, which were only used by tests.\r\n\r\nThere is another issue not addressed in this PR, which is that these things rely on `ColumnCapabilities.hasBitmapIndexes` to check if they can use indexes, which is really no longer adequate to know if something will have the type of indexes that they are going to ask for after #12388. I think in the future we might want to either update column capabilities to include all of the classes the `ColumnIndexSupplier` can supply, or make these callers check the `ColumnIndexSupplier` themselves.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-30T03:52:31Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:08:58Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T04:40:35Z","merged_at":"2022-08-02T04:40:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"6046a392b61b94bbfa6f7a083e2958e8e942ab6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

the `DruidSchema` and `DruidTable` abstractions to prepare for the Druid Catalog.\r\n\r\nAs we add the catalog, we’ll want to combine physical segment metadata information with “hints” provided by the catalog. This is best done if we tidy up the existing code to more clearly separate responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThis PR is purely a refactoring move: no functionality changed. There is no difference to user functionality or external APIs. Functionality changes will come later as we add the catalog itself.\r\n\r\n### `DruidSchema`\r\n\r\nIn the present code, `DruidSchema` does three tasks:\r\n\r\n* Holds the segment metadata cache\r\n* Interfaces with an external schema manager\r\n* Acts as a schema to Calcite\r\n\r\nThis PR splits those responsibilities.\r\n\r\n* `DruidSchema` holds the Calcite schema for the `druid` namespace, combining information fro the segment metadata cache, from the external schema manager and (later) from the catalog.\r\n* `SegmentMetadataCache` holds the segment metadata cache formerly in `DruidSchema`.\r\n\r\n### `DruidTable`\r\n\r\nThe present `DruidTable` class is a bit of a kitchen sink: it holds all the various kinds of tables which Druid supports, and uses if-statements to handle behavior that differs between types. Yet, any given `DruidTable` will handle only one such table type. To more clearly model the actual table types, we split `DruidTable` into several classes:\r\n\r\n* `DruidTable` becomes an abstract base class to hold Druid-specific methods.\r\n* `DatasourceTable` represents a datasource.\r\n* `ExternalTable` represents an external table, such as from `EXTERN` or (later) from the catalog.\r\n* `InlineTable` represents the internal case in which we attach data directly to a table.\r\n* `LookupTable` represents Druid’s lookup table mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe new subclasses are more focused: they can be selective about the data they hold and the various predicates since they represent just one table type. This will be important as the catalog information will differ depending on table type and the new structure makes adding that logic cleaner.\r\n\r\n### `DatasourceMetadata`\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `DruidSchema` segment cache would work with `DruidTable` objects. With the catalog, we need a layer between the segment metadata and the table as presented to Calcite. To fix this, the new `SegmentMetadataCache` class uses a new `DatasourceMetadata` class as its cache entry to hold only the “physical” segment metadata information: it is up to the `DruidTable` to combine this with the catalog information in a later PR.\r\n\r\n### More Efficient Table Resolution\r\n\r\nCalcite provides a convenient base class for schema objects: `AbstractSchema`. However, this class is a bit *too* convenient: all we have to do is provide a map of tables and Calcite does the rest. This means that, to resolve any single datasource, say, `foo`, we need to cache segment metadata, external schema information, and catalog information for *all* tables. Just so Calcite can do a map lookup.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing special about `AbstractSchema`. We can handle table lookups ourselves. The new `AbstractTableSchema` does this. In fact, all the rest of Calcite wants is to resolve individual tables by name, and, for commands we don’t use, to provide a list of table names.\r\n\r\n`DruidSchema` now extends `AbstractTableSchema`. `SegmentMetadataCache` resolves individual tables (and provides table names.)\r\n\r\n### `DruidSchemaManager` \r\n\r\n`DruidSchemaManager` provides a way to specify table schemas externally. In this sense, it is similar to the catalog, but only for datasources. It originally followed the `AbstractSchema` pattern: it implements provide a map of tables. This PR provides new optional methods for the table lookup and table names operations. The default implementations work the same way that `AbstractSchema` works: we get the entire map and pick out the information we need. Extensions that use this API should be revised to support the individual operations instead. Druid code no longer calls the original `getTables()` method.\r\n\r\nThe PR has one breaking change: since the `DruidSchemaManager`  map is read-only to the rest of Druid, we should return a `Map`, not a `ConcurrentMap`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR adds some missing column selectors to `NullColumnPartSerde` used by explicit null columns (added in #12279). The `VectorObjectSelector` is used by many vector aggregators when they don't care to deal with dictionary id lookup, so this fixes issues when using these aggregators with explicit null columns. I'm not certain if the `VectorValueSelector` is actually used in practice, but went ahead and added it just in case.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-29T01:33:39Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:09:02Z","closed_at":"2022-07-30T02:08:59Z","merged_at":"2022-07-30T02:08:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"d96a9c1e6f657e957d5971a252627cc7441b1a42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Description\r\nThis PR adds a `NumericRangeIndex` interface, which is like `LexicographicalRangeIndex` but for numbers. `BoundFilter` now uses `NumericRangeIndex` if comparator is numeric and there is no `extractionFn` defined, allowing number columns with indexes to take the same shortcut we use for string columns.\r\n\r\nI have wired this up to `COMPLEX<json>` columns since the nested numeric columns have bitmap indexes, which has a pretty decent performance boost compared to using the predicate based index for numeric ranges. Note that regular numeric columns do not yet have indexes yet, which I plan to add in a future PR.\r\n\r\nno index (regular numeric columns):\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       14           5000000        false  avgt    5   97.164 ± 3.767  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       14           5000000        force  avgt    5   53.835 ± 0.783  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000        false  avgt    5   75.090 ± 2.488  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000        force  avgt    5   48.634 ± 1.097  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       28           5000000        false  avgt    5   86.636 ± 3.613  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       28           5000000        force  avgt    5   52.267 ± 0.978  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\npredicate index (equivalent nested numeric columns with identical data):\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       15           5000000        false  avgt    5  552.875 ± 6.711  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       15           5000000        force  avgt    5  543.700 ± 6.557  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000        false  avgt    5   83.298 ± 1.470  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000        force  avgt    5   83.296 ± 1.646  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       29           5000000        false  avgt    5  129.794 ± 2.851  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       29           5000000        force  avgt    5  108.845 ± 2.076  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nrange index (equivalent nested numeric columns with identical data):\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       15           5000000        false  avgt    5  386.536 ± 14.620  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       15           5000000        force  avgt    5  219.167 ±  4.013  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000        false  avgt    5   13.366 ±  0.596  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000        force  avgt    5   13.465 ±  0.623  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       29           5000000        false  avgt    5   42.618 ±  0.971  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       29           5000000        force  avgt    5   41.069 ±  0.896  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nRevisiting the initial benchmarks I ran for nested columns, https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12753#issuecomment-1183571908, query '15' was significantly slower than '14' which had no indexes, and this is still true though to a lesser degree than before. Digging a bit deeper, the reason for this is that 2.6 million values match which means merging that many bitmaps. Query 27 has ~1500 matches, while query 29 has 270k matching values.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that there is some threshold of \"too many bitmaps\" at which we should skip using indexes and fall back to a full scan and value matchers. I plan to introduce a mechanism for this in a future PR.\r\n\r\nI also added some direct testing for `NestedFieldLiteralColumnIndexSupplier`, which was previously only indirectly tested via queries.

Avro parsing code leaks some \"object\" representations.  We need to convert them into Maps/Lists so that other code can understand and expect good things.  \r\n\r\nPreviously, these objects were handled with .toString(), but that's not a good contract in terms of how to work with objects.  That said, this does potentially introduce a chance for \"backwards incompatibility\" because anybody who happened to actually have these objects \"leak\" into their ingestion would have ended up with these objects being stored as a String column with a value as the .toString().  When they update to this new code, they will still have a String column, but it will be the String returned from `Map.toString()` instead of the `GenericRecord.toString`.  So, the actual content would be slightly different.\r\n\r\nRelying on this behavior is... questionable at best.  If someone is actually relying on this, then they can have the option of grabbing the avro extension from a previous version and continuing to use that instead of using this updated version.  In terms of the behavior expected out-of-the-box from the code, the behavior that this change creates is significantly better.  So, given that depending on the previous behavior is likely to be low value anyway *and* that there is a meaningful workaround in that you can choose to use the old extension jar instead, we should accept the compatibility change and make forward progress.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-27T14:46:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:07:48Z","closed_at":"2022-08-17T21:46:20Z","merged_at":"2022-08-17T21:46:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"536415b9487640cee2dee6e1b31a0bd5b062057b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release Notes","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2717749995,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE3NzQ5OTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Ingestion","name":"Area - Ingestion","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Deleting a record from a kafka topic involves sending a record with a null payload and the same key as the record you want to delete to the topic. This is also known as sending a tombstone. This PR aims to handle key value records from kafka that have keys but also null values.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

change fixes the hash calculation logic in RendexvousHasher. @abhishekagarwal87 pointed that RendezvousHashing based JDBC connection balancing produces a skew in the distribution of the connections amongst brokers.\r\n\r\nUpon checking further, it was found that the `combineOrdered` call to generate a composite hash wasn't uniformly distributing the hash value amongst all the brokers. So, the new logic creates the composite hash using the `Murmur_128` hasher which leads to a uniform distribution of load. On testing locally with 8 brokers, the old logic could produce as much as 20% skew between the lightest and heaviest broker.

[Issue #12815](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12815) for an overview of the goal of this PR. This PR provides the basic refactoring to allow a later PR to restructure the Calcite test setup which will in turn simply the proposed Druid planner test framework. This PR also lays the groundwork to simplify the complex, ad-hoc code which the \"new ITs\" use to set up tests.\r\n\r\n### Refactors Guice Injector Construction\r\n\r\nSee the above issue for an overview.\r\n\r\n#### `ExtensionsLoader`\r\n\r\nThe `Initialization` class currently performa a kitchen-sink set of tasks, one of which is to load extensions. That code was pulled out into a separate class: `ExtensionsLoader`. The previous code used global maps to hold extension information, and cobbled together a way to pass a config object into static `Initialization` methods.\r\n\r\nThe new approach is that `ExtensionsLoader` is Guice-enabled: it is created by the startup injector and passed to the primary injector. Guice, then, manages the singleton for this class. Clients of the code now obtain an `ExtensionsLoader` from Guice.\r\n\r\n`InitializationTest` cases related to extensions moved into a new `ExtensionsLoaderTest` class.\r\n\r\n### Hadoop Initialization\r\n\r\nThe `Initialization` class also holds a method, `getHadoopDependencyFilesToLoad()`, used only by Hadoop indexing tasks. This code moved to a new `Initialization` class in the indexing module. The test cases moved to a new test class.\r\n\r\n### `Initialization` Deprecation\r\n\r\nThe `Initialization` class is now virtually empty:\r\n\r\n* Hadoop-related code moved as described above.\r\n* Extension-related code moved as described above.\r\n* Module management moved into injector builders as described in [Issue #12815](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12815).\r\n\r\nThe only functionality left in `Initialization` is `makeInjectorWithModules()`, now marked as deprecated, to build an injector. However, this method adds all the server dependencies, which is not what is wanted for tests. Over time, tests will be refactored to build an injector with just the modules needed, and without server baggage. At that time, we'll drop the `makeInjectorWithModules()` method and thus the `Initialization` class itself.\r\n\r\n### `GuiceInjectors` Deprecation\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the `GuiceInjectors` class builds the startup injector. As tests shift to use the builders, `GuiceInjectors` can disappear.\r\n\r\n### `CalciteTestsInjectorBuilder`\r\n\r\nThe \"Calcite tests\" has an elaborate set of ad-hoc code in CalciteTests to hand-wire a set of mock objects. The planner test PR struggled to refactor the code to allow more flexibility. A key motivation of this clean-up is to provide a framework that uses Guice to construct the Calcite test environment.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we define a CalciteTestsInjectorBuilder class to build the injector that was previously built in a static initializer. This class is just a proof-of-concept at present: it is useful by itself.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR lets helm users specify liveness and readiness probe delays for the historical StatefulSet. This is useful when historical pods take a long time loading segments during first run.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nHard-coded 60 second delay was replaced with a 60 seconds default value from `values.yaml`\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-20T03:38:05Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:09:12Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T08:34:07Z","merged_at":"2022-07-26T08:34:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b0b1d7af317d1a6b219cf1213139abf1607eaa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2442872908,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDQyODcyOTA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Helm%20Chart","name":"Helm Chart","color":"5F90AB","default":false,"description":"https://github.com/apache/druid/tree/master/helm/druid"}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

GREATEST/LEAST function is incorrectly specifying that it cannot return null\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere is a bug with the GREATEST/LEAST functions. The functions indicates to Calcite (for query planning) that it can never ever return null (but the function itself does actually indeed can return null) regarding of the sql compatibility mode. Hence in certain cases, Calcite query optimizer will simplify the query incorrectly. \r\n\r\nFor example, the query `SELECT dim1, MAX(GREATEST(l1, l2)) IS NULL FROM druid.numfoo GROUP BY dim1` when `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false` will incorrectly be convert to the following native query:\r\n```\r\nGroupByQuery{dataSource='numfoo', querySegmentSpec=MultipleIntervalSegmentSpec{intervals=[-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z/146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z]}, virtualColumns=[], limitSpec=NoopLimitSpec, dimFilter=null, granularity=AllGranularity, dimensions=[DefaultDimensionSpec{dimension='dim1', outputName='_d0', outputType='STRING'}], aggregatorSpecs=[], postAggregatorSpecs=[ExpressionPostAggregator{name='p0', expression='0', ordering=null}], havingSpec=null, context={defaultTimeout=300000, maxScatterGatherBytes=9223372036854775807, sqlCurrentTimestamp=2000-01-01T00:00:00Z, sqlQueryId=dummy, vectorize=false, vectorizeVirtualColumns=false}}\r\n```\r\nas you can see, the following postAggregations is incorrect as the GREATEST/LEAST can return null (as `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`)\r\n```\r\n\"postAggregations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n      \"name\": \"s0\",\r\n      \"expression\": \"0\",\r\n      \"ordering\": null\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\nThe above postAggregations is Calcite optimizing the query saying that don’t even bother looking at the input values, this query will always return false (expression: “0” simply means make all rows “0” which is all rows false).

Description\r\n\r\n`Sysmonitor` stats (mem, fs, disk, net, cpu, swap, sys, tcp) are reported by all Druid processes, including _Peons_ that are ephemeral in nature. Since _Peons_ always run on the same host as the _MiddleManager_ that spawned them and is unlikely to change, the SyMonitor metrics emitted by _Peon_ are merely duplicates. This is often not a problem except when machines are super-beefy. Imagine a 64-core machine and 32 workers running on this machine. now you will have each _Peon_ reporting metrics for each core. that's an increase of (32 * 64)x in the number of metrics.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nKinesis ingestion requires all shards to have at least 1 record at the required position in druid.\r\nEven if this is satisified initially, resharding the stream can lead to empty intermediate shards. A significant delay in writing to newly created shards was also problematic.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nKinesis shard sequence numbers are big integers. Introduce two more custom sequence tokens UNREAD_TRIM_HORIZON and UNREAD_LATEST to indicate that a shard has not been read from and that it needs to be read from the start or the end respectively. \r\nThese values can be used to avoid the need to read at least one record to obtain a sequence number for ingesting a newly discovered shard.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf a record cannot be obtained immediately, use a marker to obtain the relevant shardIterator and use this shardIterator to obtain a valid sequence number. As long as a valid sequence number is not obtained, continue storing the token as the offset.\r\n\r\nThese tokens (UNREAD_TRIM_HORIZON and UNREAD_LATEST) are logically ordered to be earlier than any valid sequence number.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ordering requires a few subtle changes to the existing mechanism for record sequence validation:\r\n\r\n1) The sequence availability check ensures that the current offset is before the earliest available sequence in the shard. However, current token being an UNREAD token indicates that any sequence number in the shard is valid (despite the ordering)\r\n\r\n2) Kinesis sequence numbers are inclusive i.e if current sequence == end sequence, there are more records left to read.\r\nHowever, the equality check is exclusive when dealing with UNREAD tokens.\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KinesisSequenceNumber`\r\n * `KinesisRecordSupplier`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
