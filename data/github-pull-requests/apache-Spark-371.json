What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR addresses a few minor issues in SQL parser:\n- Removes some unused rules and keywords in the grammar.\n- Removes code path for fallback SQL parsing (was needed for Hive native parsing).\n- Use `UnresolvedGenerator` instead of hard-coding `Explode` & `JsonTuple`.\n- Adds a more generic way of creating error messages for unsupported Hive features.\n- Use `visitFunctionName` as much as possible.\n- Interpret a `CatalogColumn`'s `DataType` directly instead of parsing it again.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-01T23:17:09Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T01:14:18Z","closed_at":"2016-05-03T01:14:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe01ab72b72ff6fa95083707abf391a335b9e5fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00af1e5ff715c8b3c2bab99174ca70e3f17428d7","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-15047","ref":"SPARK-15047","sha":"00af1e5ff715c8b3c2bab99174ca70e3f17428d7","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn this PR we add support for correlated scalar subqueries. An example of such a query is:\n\n``` SQL\nselect * from tbl1 a where a.value > (select max(value) from tbl2 b where b.key = a.key)  \n```\n\nThe implementation adds the `RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery` rule to the Optimizer. This rule plans these subqueries using `LEFT OUTER` joins. It currently supports rewrites for `Project`, `Aggregate` & `Filter` logical plans.\n\nI could not find a well defined semantics for the use of scalar subqueries in an `Aggregate`. The current implementation currently evaluates the scalar subquery _before_ aggregation. This means that you either have to make scalar subquery part of the grouping expression, or that you have to aggregate it further on.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFollowing https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12779 this test became flaky. The issue is that the mean, computed for a covariance calculation, is now calculated with the standard and slightly more accurate `MultivariateOnlineSummarizer`. However I think the fact that it uses `treeAggregate` internally can lead to a different order of summation and very very slightly different results on different runs.\n\nThe immediate fix for the test, which asserts equality, is to use 1 partition. We can find out if that appears to be robust.\n\nMore generally, it's an interesting question whether we want `MultivariateOnlineSummarizer` to be deterministic. I'm not sure if another aggregation method would provide more guarantees of this, in theory or practice.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting Java stats suite.\n\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\n","created_at":"2016-05-01T08:48:01Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T12:44:43Z","closed_at":"2016-05-02T12:44:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b31c6b229e7f0ffde20d8a0786de5e86fee9d84c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5e93dc2f8aeb9d81f78bf0558a58f1d579f3d4d2","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-15043","ref":"SPARK-15043","sha":"5e93dc2f8aeb9d81f78bf0558a58f1d579f3d4d2","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn order to support nested predicate subquery, this PR introduce an internal join type ExistenceJoin, which will emit all the rows from left, plus an additional column, which presents there are any rows matched from right or not (it's not null-aware right now). This additional column could be used to replace the subquery in Filter.\n\nIn theory, all the predicate subquery could use this join type, but it's slower than LeftSemi and LeftAnti, so it's only used for nested subquery (subquery inside OR).\n\nFor example, the following SQL:\n\n``` sql\nSELECT a FROM t  WHERE EXISTS (select 0) OR EXISTS (select 1)\n```\n\nThis PR also fix a bug in predicate subquery push down through join (they should not).\n\nNested null-aware subquery is still not supported. For example,   `a > 3 OR b NOT IN (select bb from t)`\n\nAfter this, we could run TPCDS query Q10, Q35, Q45\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-01T07:59:45Z","updated_at":"2016-05-02T20:07:04Z","closed_at":"2016-05-02T20:00:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"56804cf424dfa111fe46e139f5bd2ce79fa86dc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1bb9f6072c5a97190ec75e09b6647c8bda903285","head":{"label":"davies:or_exists","ref":"or_exists","sha":"1bb9f6072c5a97190ec75e09b6647c8bda903285","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is an update for [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12738] which:\n- Adds a generic unit test for JavaParams wrappers in pyspark.ml for checking default Param values vs. the defaults in the Scala side\n- Various fixes for bugs found\n  - This includes changing classes taking weightCol to treat unset and empty String Param values the same way.\n\nDefaults changed:\n- Scala\n  - LogisticRegression: weightCol defaults to not set (instead of empty string)\n  - StringIndexer: labels default to not set (instead of empty array)\n  - GeneralizedLinearRegression:\n    - maxIter always defaults to 25 (simpler than defaulting to 25 for a particular solver)\n  - weightCol defaults to not set (instead of empty string)\n  - LinearRegression: weightCol defaults to not set (instead of empty string)\n- Python\n  - MultilayerPerceptron: layers default to not set (instead of [1,1])\n  - ChiSqSelector: numTopFeatures defaults to 50 (instead of not set)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nGeneric unit test.  Manually tested that unit test by changing defaults and verifying that broke the test.\n","created_at":"2016-04-30T22:03:13Z","updated_at":"2016-05-01T19:31:00Z","closed_at":"2016-05-01T19:31:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2008f294611b796ff6a7090a955339581c4c524b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12816/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12816/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12816/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00245dde834e1aa57676ef03c74b765d8a74f42a","head":{"label":"jkbradley:yinxusen-SPARK-14931","ref":"yinxusen-SPARK-14931","sha":"00245dde834e1aa57676ef03c74b765d8a74f42a","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR contains three changes:\n1. We will use spark.sql.warehouse.dir set warehouse location. We will not use hive.metastore.warehouse.dir.\n2. SessionCatalog needs to set the location to default db. Otherwise, when creating a table in SparkSession without hive support, the default db's path will be an empty string.\n3. When we create a database, we need to make the path qualified.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests and new tests\n","created_at":"2016-04-30T08:19:02Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T07:05:16Z","closed_at":"2016-05-01T01:06:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15d96149da365aefeabc9241b2b2954a7c4efcf7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12812/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12812/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12812/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8b0983274cd9e2ad1b2c1caff40422eec4a0671","head":{"label":"yhuai:warehouse","ref":"warehouse","sha":"f8b0983274cd9e2ad1b2c1caff40422eec4a0671","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b3ea579314945dc1fcb4a260fbc7af8479d139f2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR aims to update Scala/Python/Java examples by replacing `SQLContext` with newly added `SparkSession`. \n- Use **SparkSession Builder Pattern** in 154(Scala 55, Java 52, Python 47) files.\n- Add `getConf` in Python SparkContext class: `python/pyspark/context.py`\n- Replace **SQLContext Singleton Pattern** with **SparkSession Singleton Pattern**:\n  - `SqlNetworkWordCount.scala`\n  - `JavaSqlNetworkWordCount.java`\n  - `sql_network_wordcount.py`\n\nNow, `SQLContexts` are used only in R examples and the following two Python examples. The python examples are untouched in this PR since it already fails some unknown issue.\n- `simple_params_example.py`\n- `aft_survival_regression.py`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual.\n","created_at":"2016-04-30T07:21:06Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T01:01:05Z","closed_at":"2016-05-04T21:33:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"331ef2f6a1af26bd3479402fcc28102c0bb572f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0346dda3d614b0139bf569d496a355a5be5bd7ee","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-15031","ref":"SPARK-15031","sha":"0346dda3d614b0139bf569d496a355a5be5bd7ee","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0fd3a4748416233f034ec137d95f0a4c8712d396","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe issue is that when the user provides the path option with uppercase \"PATH\" key, `options` contains `PATH` key and will get into the non-external case in the following code in `createDataSourceTables.scala`, where a new key \"path\" is created with a default path. \n\n```\nval optionsWithPath =\n      if (!options.contains(\"path\")) {\n        isExternal = false\n        options + (\"path\" -> sessionState.catalog.defaultTablePath(tableIdent))\n      } else {\n        options\n      }\n```\n\nSo before creating hive table, serdeInfo.parameters will contain both \"PATH\" and \"path\" keys and different directories. and Hive table's dataLocation contains the value of \"path\". \n\nThe fix in this PR is to convert `options` in the code above to `CaseInsensitiveMap` before checking for containing \"path\" key. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA testcase is added\n","created_at":"2016-04-30T06:02:36Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T00:20:40Z","closed_at":"2016-05-10T00:20:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd4db741c0b9cf378d975f00ddaf91b81460d8d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12804/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12804/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12804/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8c3fbe6c0bd9e85bdd79442c75513e63b1059a39","head":{"label":"xwu0226:SPARK-15025","ref":"SPARK-15025","sha":"8c3fbe6c0bd9e85bdd79442c75513e63b1059a39","user":{"login":"xwu0226","id":14225992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226","html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42968936,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjk2ODkzNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"xwu0226/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xwu0226","id":14225992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226","html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n~~Currently, multiple partitions are allowed to drop by using a single DDL command: Alter Table Drop Partition. However, the internal implementation could break atomicity. That means, we could just drop a subset of qualified partitions, if hitting an exception when dropping one of qualified partitions~~\n\n~~This PR contains the following behavior changes:~~\n~~\\- disallow dropping multiple partitions by a single command ~~\n~~- allow users to input predicates in partition specification and issue a nicer error message if the predicate's comparison operator is not `=`.~~\n~~\\- verify the partition spec in SessionCatalog. This can ensure each partition spec in `Drop Partition` does not correspond to multiple partitions.~~\n\nThis PR has two major parts:\n- Verify the partition spec in SessionCatalog for fixing the following issue:\n  \n  ``` scala\n  sql(s\"ALTER TABLE $externalTab DROP PARTITION (ds='2008-04-09', unknownCol='12')\")\n  ```\n  \n  Above example uses an invalid partition spec. Without this PR, we will drop all the partitions. The reason is Hive megastores getPartitions API returns all the partitions if we provide an invalid spec.\n- Re-implemented the `dropPartitions` in `HiveClientImpl`. Now, we always check if all the user-specified partition specs exist before attempting to drop the partitions. Previously, we start drop the partition before completing checking the existence of all the partition specs. If any failure happened after we start to drop the partitions, we will log an error message to indicate which partitions have been dropped and which partitions have not been dropped. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nModified the existing test cases and added new test cases.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis change will only shade and relocate Guava in the spark-examples JAR used by the Apache Bigtop distribution (as of writing the Bigtop distribution uses the unshaded JAR).  Since only Guava and Jetty are relocated, and since there are 0 references to Jetty in the spark-examples codebase, only Guava needs to be shaded.  The shaded spark-assembly JAR provides the rest of the dependencies needed to get the spark-examples to run without any NoClassDefFoundErrors\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmvn package

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently in `StreamTest`, we have a `StartStream` which will start a streaming query against trigger `ProcessTime(intervalMS = 0)` and `SystemClock`.\n\nWe also need to test cases against `ProcessTime(intervalMS > 0)`, which often requires `ManualClock`.\n\nThis patch:\n- fixes an issue of `ProcessingTimeExecutor`, where for a batch it should run `batchRunner` only once but might run multiple times under certain conditions;\n- adds support for testing against the `ProcessingTime(intervalMS > 0)` trigger and `ManualClock`, by specifying them as fields for `StartStream`, and by adding an `AdvanceManualClock` action;\n- adds a test, which takes advantage of the new `StartStream` and `AdvanceManualClock`, to test against [PR#[SPARK-14942] Reduce delay between batch construction and execution ](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12725).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A\n","created_at":"2016-04-30T02:02:52Z","updated_at":"2016-07-21T03:06:39Z","closed_at":"2016-05-04T17:27:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c20ebb2cef5e152d977b696be398e0965c17143","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc899628fa67acfbe6bb3d8e2c0ba2aefc2422a6","head":{"label":"lw-lin:add-trigger-test-support","ref":"add-trigger-test-support","sha":"bc899628fa67acfbe6bb3d8e2c0ba2aefc2422a6","user":{"login":"lw-lin","id":15843379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49997538,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTk5NzUzOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"lw-lin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lw-lin","id":15843379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen fitting a PySpark Pipeline without the `stages` param set, a confusing NoneType error is raised as attempts to iterate over the pipeline stages.  A pipeline with no stages should act as an identity transform, however the `stages` param still needs to be set to an empty list.  This change improves the error output when the `stages` param is not set and adds a better description of what the API expects as input.  Also minor cleanup of related code.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new unit tests to verify an empty Pipeline acts as an identity

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR splits the MLlib algorithms into two flavors:\n- the R flavor, which tries to mimic the existing R API for these algorithms (and works as an S4 specialization for Spark dataframes)\n- the Spark flavor, which follows the same API and naming conventions as the rest of the MLlib algorithms in the other languages\n\nIn practice, the former calls the latter.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe tests for the various algorithms were adapted to be run against both interfaces.\n","created_at":"2016-04-29T22:14:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T06:14:47Z","closed_at":"2016-04-30T06:14:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de1ef9e0356797aff365ff9f7971a6285b0e3e51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f57db8230d95597d906a242724ce8869d7d489e0","head":{"label":"thunterdb:14831","ref":"14831","sha":"f57db8230d95597d906a242724ce8869d7d489e0","user":{"login":"thunterdb","id":7594753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTQ3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7594753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb","html_url":"https://github.com/thunterdb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21404403,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQwNDQwMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"thunterdb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thunterdb","id":7594753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTQ3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7594753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb","html_url":"https://github.com/thunterdb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thunterdb/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPer discussion on [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12604], this removes ML persistence for Python tuning (TrainValidationSplit, CrossValidator, and their Models) since they do not handle nesting easily.  This support should be re-designed and added in the next release.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRemoved unit test elements saving and loading the tuning algorithms, but kept tests to save and load their bestModel

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds native `SHOW CREATE TABLE` DDL command for data source tables. Support for Hive tables will be added in follow-up PR(s).\n\nTo show table creation DDL for data source tables created by CTAS statements, this PR also added partitioning and bucketing support for normal `CREATE TABLE ... USING ...` syntax.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\n\nA new test suite `ShowCreateTableSuite` is added in sql/hive package to test the new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14962\n\nORC filters were being pushed down for all types for both `IsNull` and `IsNotNull`.\n\nThis is apparently OK because both `IsNull` and `IsNotNull` do not take a type as an argument (Hive 1.2.x) during building filters (`SearchArgument`) in Spark-side but they do not filter correctly because stored statistics always produces `null` for not supported types (eg `ArrayType`) in ORC-side. So, it is always `true` for `IsNull` which ends up with always `false` for `IsNotNull`. (Please see [RecordReaderImpl.java#L296-L318](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-1.2/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/orc/RecordReaderImpl.java#L296-L318)  and [RecordReaderImpl.java#L359-L365](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-1.2/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/orc/RecordReaderImpl.java#L359-L365) in Hive 1.2)\n\nThis looks prevented in Hive 1.3.x >= by forcing to give a type ([`PredicateLeaf.Type`](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/e085b7e9bd059d91aaf013df0db4d71dca90ec6f/storage-api/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/sarg/PredicateLeaf.java#L50-L56)) when building a filter ([`SearchArgument`](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/26b5c7b56a4f28ce3eabc0207566cce46b29b558/storage-api/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/sarg/SearchArgument.java#L260)) but Hive 1.2.x seems not doing this. \n\nThis PR prevents ORC filter creation for `IsNull` and `IsNotNull` on unsupported types. `OrcFilters` resembles `ParquetFilters`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnittests in `OrcQuerySuite` and `OrcFilterSuite` and `sbt scalastyle`.\n","created_at":"2016-04-29T11:50:13Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:45Z","closed_at":"2016-05-06T17:48:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c31ac581c2cf097f3169bc4048f229a508b8e2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12777/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12777/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12777/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f51d04b4883f358d4f3dddce1767215275ffff7b","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-14962","ref":"SPARK-14962","sha":"f51d04b4883f358d4f3dddce1767215275ffff7b","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`AccumulatorContext` is not thread-safe, that's why all of its methods are synchronized. However, there is one exception: the `AccumulatorContext.originals`. `NewAccumulator` use it to check if it's registered, which is wrong as it's not synchronized. \n\nThis PR mark `AccumulatorContext.originals` as `private` and now all access to `AccumulatorContext` is synchronized.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI verified it locally. To be safe, we can let jenkins test it many times to make sure this problem is gone.\n","created_at":"2016-04-29T02:35:56Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T08:31:25Z","closed_at":"2016-04-29T04:59:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a8f6a55f1fbf2592f359770477edd533f23ac8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12773/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12773/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12773/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea2ba20a1141f1a5ac89a780906b0ef90b40fc80","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:debug","ref":"debug","sha":"ea2ba20a1141f1a5ac89a780906b0ef90b40fc80","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

PR adds schema validation to `ml`'s ALS and ALSModel. Currently, no schema validation was performed as `transformSchema` was never called in `ALS.fit` or `ALSModel.transform`. Furthermore, due to no schema validation, if users passed in Long (or Float etc) ids, they would be silently cast to Int with no warning or error thrown.\n\nWith this PR, ALS now supports all numeric types for `user`, `item`, and `rating` columns. The rating column is cast to `Float` and the user and item cols are cast to `Int` (as is the case currently) - however for user/item, the cast throws an error if the value is outside integer range. Behavior for rating col is unchanged (as it is not an issue).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test cases in `ALSSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-04-28T18:58:53Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T00:52:49Z","closed_at":"2016-05-18T19:15:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a06a7948f0692f89ac43caa122dc4cd21cded86b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1fd1f873f0926cace39c6ee16a830c16710bc6d0","head":{"label":"MLnick:SPARK-14891-als-validate-schema","ref":"SPARK-14891-als-validate-schema","sha":"1fd1f873f0926cace39c6ee16a830c16710bc6d0","user":{"login":"MLnick","id":1036807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1036807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick","html_url":"https://github.com/MLnick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56315295,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjMxNTI5NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"MLnick/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MLnick","id":1036807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1036807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick","html_url":"https://github.com/MLnick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MLnick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MLnick/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhere aggregations were being done against feature vectors, replaced the use of arrays with a new `VectorBuilder` class. This class has both dense and sparse implementations, similar to the existing `Vector` class. The dense implementation is essentially a wrapper around an array, while the sparse implementation uses a hashmap. This allows values to be aggregated into the structure (cannot be done with the existing `SparseVector`).\n\nAggregations are dense by default. There is a new parameter on `LogisticRegression` called `useSparseAgg` to specify that sparse implementations should be used for aggregation; otherwise behavior should be identical to before this PR. Note that this value had to be added to the constructor of `MultivariateOnlineSummarizer` as well, although a default was set so it will not break existing code - WARNING this may break binary compatibility, although this is developer API so I don't expect that to be a problem.\n\nAside from the new `VectorBuilder` class and the new `useSparseAgg` parameter, the changes are largely line-for-line mapping from using arrays to the new vector builders.\n\nThis change was made with the intention of having zero impact for anyone who doesn't explicitly opt in by setting the `useSparseAgg` parameter to true.\n\nWhile this change has been made only for logistic regression, it is likely the same technique could be applied to other estimators.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests added, existing unit tests pass.\n\nThe original version of these changes I made by copying some code into my own project and making the changes I needed. These were tested on my production training flow with a few different settings to do verify the performance improvements. Additionally, I attempted to verify this does not degrade performance with dense aggregation, and while it didn't seem to I did not test this thoroughly.\n\nSpark doesn't build on my machine (even on master) so I cannot verify that everything works. I'm not sure what tests exist to defend against performance regressions, but I assume there are some that will be run before the pull request is merged. If there are additional tests that need to be created for the sparse aggregation case, please let me know.\n\nAlso, please note that this is the first patch I have attempted to submit to Spark. Please do give my code a careful review.\n## Reviewers\n\nPR submission guidelines suggest mentioning some of the committers to the relevant code.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently only a list of users can be specified for view and modify acls. This change enables a group of admins/devs/users to be provisioned for viewing and modifying Spark jobs.\n\n**Changes Proposed in the fix**\nThree new corresponding config entries have been added where the user can specify the groups to be given access. \n\n```\nspark.admin.acls.groups \nspark.modify.acls.groups\nspark.ui.view.acls.groups\n```\n\nNew config entries were added because specifying the users and groups explicitly is a better and cleaner way compared to specifying them in the existing config entry using a delimiter.  \n\nA generic trait has been introduced to provide the user to group mapping which makes it pluggable to support a variety of mapping protocols - similar to the one used in hadoop. A default unix shell based implementation has been provided.\nCustom user to group mapping protocol can be specified and configured by the entry `spark.user.groups.mapping`\n\n**How the patch was Tested**\nWe ran different spark jobs setting the config entries in combinations of admin, modify and ui acls. For modify acls we tried killing the job stages from the ui and using yarn commands. For view acls we tried accessing the UI tabs and the logs.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently Spark SQL doesn't support sorting columns in descending order. However, the parser accepts the syntax and silently drops sorting directions. This PR fixes this by throwing an exception if `DESC` is specified as sorting direction of a sorting column.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA test case is added to test the invalid sorting order by checking exception

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdded provision to specify the 'spark.executor.extraJavaOptions' value in terms of the Executor Id(i.e. @execid@). @execid@ will be replaced with the Executor Id while starting the executor.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI have verified this by checking the executor process command  and gc logs. I verified the same in different deployement modes(Standalone, YARN, Mesos).\n","created_at":"2016-04-28T10:51:05Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T09:48:36Z","closed_at":"2016-08-29T09:48:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52a05d18d24b412e8b849b9966007106bae195c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12753/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12753/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12753/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23fa1e3763c3a2f9b3a608c69dfd3c0face67d54","head":{"label":"devaraj-kavali:SPARK-3767","ref":"SPARK-3767","sha":"23fa1e3763c3a2f9b3a608c69dfd3c0face67d54","user":{"login":"devaraj-kavali","id":3174804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3174804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali","html_url":"https://github.com/devaraj-kavali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20208591,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDIwODU5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"devaraj-kavali/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"devaraj-kavali","id":3174804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3174804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali","html_url":"https://github.com/devaraj-kavali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/devaraj-kavali/spark","description":"Mirror

Previously, these tasks were then being retried over and over again until the stage possibly completes (despite using compute resources on these superfluous tasks).  With this change (applied to the 1.6 branch), they no longer retry and the stage completes successfully without these extra task

patch improves the performance of `InferSchema.compatibleType` and `inferField`. The net result of this patch is a 6x speedup in local benchmarks running against cached data with a massive nested schema.\n\nThe key idea is to remove unnecessary sorting in `compatibleType`'s `StructType` merging code. This code takes two structs, merges the fields with matching names, and copies over the unique fields, producing a new schema which is the union of the two structs' schemas. Previously, this code performed a very inefficient `groupBy()` to match up fields with the same name, but this is unnecessary because `inferField` already sorts structs' fields by name: since both lists of fields are sorted, we can simply merge them in a single pass.\n\nThis patch also speeds up the existing field sorting in `inferField`: the old sorting code allocated unnecessary intermediate collections, while the new code uses mutable collects and performs in-place sorting.\n\nI rewrote inefficient `equals()` implementations in `StructType` and `Metadata`, significantly reducing object allocations in those methods.\n\nFinally, I replaced a `treeAggregate` call with `fold`: I doubt that `treeAggregate` will benefit us very much because the schemas would have to be enormous to realize large savings in network traffic. Since most schemas are probably fairly small in serialized form, they should typically fit within a direct task result and therefore can be incrementally merged at the driver as individual tasks finish. This change eliminates an entire (short) scheduler stage.

in the `modules_to_test()` function in `dev/run-tests.py`: since `root` now depends on `build` (since every test needs to run on any build test), we now need to check for the presence of root in `modules_to_test` instead of `changed_modules`.\n","created_at":"2016-04-27T20:47:09Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T13:15:03Z","closed_at":"2016-04-27T23:34:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"49cc33b307507f84ed9ef03b4dbe2459562f1a11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/237fd74527ae52fb62a04efc409b955f9fad41ca","head":{"label":"yhuai:1.6build","ref":"1.6build","sha":"237fd74527ae52fb62a04efc409b955f9fad41ca","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-1.6","ref":"branch-1.6","sha":"496496b2548387ad2889eaaf884ab039096436ef","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

local profiling, I noticed SizeEstimator spending tons of time estimating the size of objects which contain TypeTag or ClassTag fields. The problem with these tags is that they reference global Scala reflection objects, which, in turn, reference many singletons, such as TestHive. This throws off the accuracy of the size estimation and wastes tons of time traversing a huge object graph.\n\nAs a result, I think that SizeEstimator should ignore any classes in the `scala.reflect` package.\n","created_at":"2016-04-27T20:34:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T00:55:45Z","closed_at":"2016-04-28T00:36:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13017a21cfc416981417126610040cd61543722b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12741/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12741/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12741/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e51c7e8ffb6e672048c148c1b686f579b631326a","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:ignore-scala-reflect-in-size-estimator","ref":"ignore-scala-reflect-in-size-estimator","sha":"e51c7e8ffb6e672048c148c1b686f579b631326a","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the `columnPartition()` method of `JDBCRelation`, stride is used for calculating the increment. But in some cases, this value could be zero, for example, lowerBound=0, upperBound=7, numOfPartition=8, which put all the data into one partition (last partition).\n\nThis fix will try to make stride calculation more robust. I have also added require() to validate the input. `equals()` is added for overriding the parents `equals()` method, together with `hashCode()`.\n\nI have also fixed some text style, make keywords all uppercase.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test cases were added to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nReplaces a logical `Except` operator with a `Left-anti Join` operator. This way, we can take advantage of all the benefits of join implementations (e.g. managed memory, code generation, broadcast joins).\n\n``` SQL\n  SELECT a1, a2 FROM Tab1 EXCEPT SELECT b1, b2 FROM Tab2\n  ==>  SELECT DISTINCT a1, a2 FROM Tab1 LEFT ANTI JOIN Tab2 ON a1<=>b1 AND a2<=>b2\n```\n\n Note:\n1. This rule is only applicable to EXCEPT DISTINCT. Do not use it for EXCEPT ALL.\n2. This rule has to be done after de-duplicating the attributes; otherwise, the enerated\n   join conditions will be incorrect.\n\nThis PR also corrects the existing behavior in Spark. Before this PR, the behavior is like \n\n``` SQL\n  test(\"except\") {\n    val df_left = Seq(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4).toDF(\"id\")\n    val df_right = Seq(1, 3).toDF(\"id\")\n\n    checkAnswer(\n      df_left.except(df_right),\n      Row(2) :: Row(2) :: Row(4) :: Nil\n    )\n  }\n```\n\nAfter this PR, the result is corrected. We strictly follow the SQL compliance of `Except Distinct`.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nModified and added a few test cases to verify the optimization rule and the results of operators.\n","created_at":"2016-04-27T15:24:16Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T07:33:15Z","closed_at":"2016-04-29T07:32:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70d89e283d1f6348c3437a39ae28f5203e97075e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12736/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12736/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12736/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4920360c525d4ff73711635a2ce0ef90d486a6c3","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:exceptByAntiJoin","ref":"exceptByAntiJoin","sha":"4920360c525d4ff73711635a2ce0ef90d486a6c3","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR removes three methods the were deprecated in 1.6.0:\n- `PortableDataStream.close()`\n- `LinearRegression.weights`\n- `LogisticRegression.weights`\n\nThe rationale for doing this is that the impact is small and that Spark 2.0 is a major release.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nCompilation succeded.\n","created_at":"2016-04-27T10:44:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T15:07:57Z","closed_at":"2016-04-30T15:07:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0deeb6c08b14f7616c07dbd65cbff471c11577f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2e74b7b99e76803647944b8ac4eabd8fa1884db0","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-14952","ref":"SPARK-14952","sha":"2e74b7b99e76803647944b8ac4eabd8fa1884db0","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe can support subexpression elimination in TungstenAggregate by using current `EquivalentExpressions` which is already used in subexpression elimination for expression codegen.\n\nHowever, in wholestage codegen, we can't wrap the common expression's codes in functions as before, we simply generate the code snippets for common expressions. These code snippets are inserted before the common expressions are actually used in generated java codes.\n\nFor multiple `TypedAggregateExpression` used in aggregation operator, since their input type should be the same. So their `inputDeserializer` will be the same too. This patch can also reduce redundant input deserialization.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-27T08:39:27Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:28Z","closed_at":"2016-05-04T17:56:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"150f61ffd890ae1a5317fd43a7cc25572db03f14","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12729/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12729/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12729/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b362b03fde25491f2f33f5198145525bda17694d","head":{"label":"viirya:subexpr-elimination-tungstenaggregate","ref":"subexpr-elimination-tungstenaggregate","sha":"b362b03fde25491f2f33f5198145525bda17694d","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch removes HiveConf from HiveTableScanExec and HiveTableReader and instead just uses our own configuration system.
