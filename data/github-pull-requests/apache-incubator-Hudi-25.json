Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis fixes the Hudi file writers to honor bloom filter configs.  Before this fix, the bloom filter parameters are hard-coded in `HoodieFileWriterFactory`.\r\n\r\nGiven that `HoodieFileWriterFactory` is in `hudi-common` module, the bloom filter-related configs are moved from `HoodieIndexConfig` (in `hudi-client-common` module) to `HoodieStorageConfig` (in `hudi-common` module), so they can be referenced.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMake sure bloom filter configs take effect.\r\n\r\nThe fix is tested by running the Spark quick start guide with bloom filter configs.  After the fix, the bloom filter configs take effect on the bloom filter written to the parquet footer (do not take effect before the fix).\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.hudi.QuickstartUtils._\r\nimport

by table with wrong path.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nFiltering tables with incorrect paths in the multi table service.\r\n\r\nThe current multi table service supports executing table service for multiple tables by specifying them through `hoodie.tableservice.tablesToServe`. When an incorrect path is provided for a table or a table is deleted but the asynchronous table service is not yet aware of it, the current implementation causes the entire Spark job to fail, impacting the execution of other tables. It is expected that this should not impact the table service of other tables with correctly configured paths. The parameter `hoodie.tableservice.skip.wrong.path` is used to determine whether to ignore incorrect table path.\r\n\r\nIn order to address this issue, I will introduce a check to skip such cases and log the details of tables that do not conform to Hudi's requirements using `Log.error`.\r\n\r\nA question for discussion: What kind of exceptions do you think should impact the table service of other tables in the same batch, and what kind should not? Alternatively, we can set a flag to choose whether to enable interference-free mode or not.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies the encoding of Java `String` to byte array in Hudi, especially for writing bytes to the storage, by using `UTF_8` encoding only.  There are places calling `String.getBytes()` which are fixed by this PR.  `String.getBytes()` uses the platform's default charset and encoding scheme.  Note that the default character encoding scheme on Windows is ANSI, while the default character encoding scheme on Linux is UTF-8.  The PR has no impact on Linux systems writing and reading Hudi tables.\r\n\r\nThese are the places that used `String.getBytes()` before, which are fixed to use `UTF_8` encoding.\r\n```\r\nMercifulJsonConverter#generateBytesTypeHandler\r\nHoodieJsonPayload#compressData\r\nSimpleBloomFilter#write\r\nHFileBootstrapIndexWriter#writeNextSourceFileMapping\r\nHoodiePartitionMetadata#writeMetafile\r\nHoodieHFileDataBlock#serializeRecords\r\nHoodieLogBlock#getLogMetadataBytes\r\nHoodieDefaultTimeline#setInstants\r\nRocksDBDAO\r\nHoodieAvroHFileReader\r\nHoodieAvroHFileWriter\r\nHoodieAvroOrcWriter\r\nHoodieTableMetadataUtil#convertMetadataToBloomFilterRecords\r\nHoodieTableMetadataUtil#readBloomFilter\r\n```\r\nWe don't intend to make these backwards compatible for Windows which can be broken because of different default charset.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMake sure the encoding of Java `String` and storage bytes in a Hudi table does not depend on platforms.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9114, corner case when a record moves from 1 partition to another with partition path update set to true\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/eab00d570fdc986d865b511cc0402069b4b9ce2b/hudi-client/hudi-spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/index/hbase/SparkHoodieHBaseIndex.java#L235-L242\r\n1. Hbase index tagLocation is executed concurrently in different spark partitions, so the index delete operation may happen after index add operation, cause the undefined behavior as [codope](https://github.com/codope) said.\r\n2. ReduceByKey can be a costly operation as https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9114#discussion_r1251177363 discussed\r\nso add a flag to ignore this index delete operations in partitionPathUpdate condition\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe default values for the configs below are incorrect:\r\n\r\n1. hoodie.datasource.write.row.writer.enable\r\n2. hoodie.clustering.preserve.commit.metadata (getPreserveHoodieMetadata)\r\n\r\nThe default values are not loaded from `#defaultVal` as the configurations are defined in a module-scope that is inaccessible by the current scope. This is why config keys are defined as string here.\r\n\r\nRaising a PR to fix these inconsistencies first. Subsequent refactoring might be required to move these config-keys to a scope that is accessible by all other (relevant) modules.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The existing test coverage does not cover clustering performed using the RowWriter API. Only RDD API is included as of now. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nNone - correctness + ease of debugging through consistency\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new File Group Reader, `HoodieFileGroupReader<T>`, to unify Hudi-specific reader logic across all query types in a single class, while allowing plug-in `HoodieReaderContext<T>` for engine-specific implementation on reading data files, getting field values from a record, transforming a record, etc.  The type argument `T` denotes the type of engine-specific record representation, e.g., `InternalRow` in Spark, `RowData` in Flink, and `ArrayWritable` in Hive, etc.\r\n\r\nThe reader operates on the engine-specific record representation for reading and merging.  This includes reading the base file and log blocks into `ClosableIterator<T>`.  When merging, the engine-specific records are converted to `HoodieRecord<T>` and passed to `HoodieRecordMerger#merge` API.\r\n\r\nThis PR covers the basic file group reading logic with merging base and log files of parquet format.  Features including schema evolution across base and log files, different base and log file format, de-hadooping, etc., will be addressed as follow-ups.\r\n\r\nThis PR serves as a first step towards a public Hudi file group reader across engines.  There will be follow-ups to make sure the engine integration with Spark, Hive, and Flink can work on the new File Group Reader.  The goal is to remove Hudi-speicific query and merging logic as much as possible from the engine integration and have them in the common file group reader in the format layer.\r\n- Spark: replaces the read and merging logic in `NewHoodieParquetFileFormat` and `Iterators`\r\n- Flink: replaces the read and merging logic in `MergeOnReadInputFormat` and `RecordIterators`\r\n- Hive: replaces the read and merging logic in different implementation of `AbstractRealtimeRecordReader` (e.g., `RealtimeCompactedRecordReader`, `RealtimeUnmergedRecordReader`,  `HoodieMergeOnReadSnapshotReader`) \r\n\r\nA detailed RFC will be put up once all details are figured out.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe new File Group Reader, `HoodieFileGroupReader`, aims to unify Hudi-specific reader logic across all query types in a single class, while allowing plug-in `HoodieReaderContext<T>` for engine-specific implementation on reading data files, getting field values from a record, transforming a record, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is no impact on existing readers as the new File Group Reader is not integrated in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFew issues to clean up in our spark quick start guide. \r\n1. Added code snippets for keyless table in addition to primary keyed tables. \r\n2. Simplified entire quick start to focus only on CRUD operations. For advanced operations, added references to other pages. \r\n3. Added brief section on streaming writers and added other references. \r\n4. Removed adhoc spark-sql commands, procedures and added references to other pages.  \r\n5. Our quick start page had references to deprecated config keys. Replaced them to use ConfigProperties.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves usability for end user. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-05T22:43:13Z","updated_at":"2023-09-14T02:15:47Z","closed_at":"2023-09-14T02:15:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":515932905,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MTU5MzI5MDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/docs","name":"docs","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5187724363,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNTZkSw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.14.0","name":"release-0.14.0","color":"B9BAA3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9622/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9622/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9622/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/a58b579cfea743610f62c96ac9e35cc46f6625ef","head":{"label":"nsivabalan:asf-site-pkless1","ref":"asf-site-pkless1","sha":"a58b579cfea743610f62c96ac9e35cc46f6625ef","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159547623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk1NDc2MjM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"nsivabalan/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan/hudi","description":"Spark

Change Logs\r\n\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change. Highlight if any code was copied._\r\n1. Allow `HoodieInstant` to identify complete instants with completion time\r\n2. Name change: `stateTransitionTime` -> `completionTime`\r\n3. Add new interface `TimeGenerator` and one impl `WaitBasedTimeGenerator`. The singleton `TimeGenerators` is used to manage it.\r\n4. For write client and meta client, we all introduce public APIs for new instant time generation\r\n5. Passing some configs to the `metaClient`, so the active timeline from the meta client could do metadata file state transitions with the time generator.\r\n6. Introduce `HoodieTimeGeneratorConfig` and by default, we have a in-process lock provider based `TimeGenerator` impl.\r\n\r\nThe complete instant will add completion time, for example,\r\n\r\n```java\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 hui.an  staff    64B Sep  5 18:34 archived\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 hui.an  staff   784B Sep  5 18:34 hoodie.properties\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 hui.an  staff     0B Sep  5 18:35 20230905183414319.commit.requested\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 hui.an  staff   2.1K Sep  5 18:36 20230905183414319.inflight\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 hui.an  staff   5.3K Sep  5 18:37 20230905183414319_20230905183706849.commit\r\n```\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe attempted a fix to avoid reading spurious log blocks on the reader side with https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9545. \r\nWhen I tested the patch end to end, found some gaps. Specifically, the attempt Id we had with taskContextSupplier was not referring to task's attempt number. So, fixing it in this patch. Tested end to test by simulating spark retries and spurious log blocks. Reader is able to detect them and ignore multiple copies of log blocks. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nProperly deduce and skip spurious log blocks on the reader \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen table/database is not found when syncing table to Glue, glue should return `EntityNotFoundException`.\r\nAfter upgrading to AWS SDK V2, Hudi uses `GlueAsyncClient` to get a `CompletableFuture`, which would throw `ExecutionException` with `EntityNotFoundException` nested when table/database doesn't exist. However, existing Hudi code doesn't handle `ExecutionException` and would fail the job.\r\n\r\nSample exception:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieMetaSyncException: Could not sync using the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to support custom logic during data write through Merger API. Our current solution is to add Option wrapper for older and newer parameters in merge function. In such way, all of update, delete, combine logics are merged into one api. Meanwhile, we apply this merge function into HoodieMergeHandle to handle both update and insert write path.\r\n\r\nTESTS:\r\nUnit tests are added for existing merger implementations.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers could implement merge api to support their own logic about deletion now.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThere are three configs in the `hoodie.properties` that hold classnames; `KEY_GENERATOR_CLASS_NAME`, `BOOTSTRAP_INDEX_CLASS_NAME`, `PAYLOAD_CLASS_NAME`. This PR adds enums for them and sets the enum in table config while inferring the classname from the enum in the getters.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nTable properties will not have any classname. The class name configs have only been depreacated but not removed for compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe currently uses Flink to generate  clustering plans online, and then Spark to execute them offline.\r\n\r\nWhat we expect is to generate a clustering plan every four commits，like:\r\ncommit1,commit2,commit3,commit4,clustering1,commit5,commit6,commit7,commit8,clustering2\r\n\r\nHowever, current timeline is:\r\ncommit4,clustering1,commit5,clustering2,commit6,clustering3....\r\n\r\nThis is not what we want. \r\n\r\nWhether to generate a clustering plan should be determined by whether plan generation has been enabled, rather than whether plan execution has been enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nclustering plan generate.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nImplement writing record positions to the block header for data blocks containing updates and delete blocks.\r\n\r\n- Add a new long field `position` to the `HoodieRecordLocation` model. It is the position of a record in the file, e.g., row position starting from 0 in the Parquet file.\r\n- Positions will only be written if `hoodie.write.record.positions` is set to true.\r\n- Changes in `HoodieDataBlock` and `HoodieDeleteBlock` to handle writing record positions.\r\n- Change `HoodieFileReader#filterRowKeys` to return not only the set of filtered keys but also their position in the file.\r\n- Log format tests for the new header and e2e tests for MOR table with the aforementioned config enabled.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe record positions can be used to improve the performance of merging records from base and log files.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\nCore write path guarded by config.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nToday we write the commit metadata for most of the actions as avro byte arrays. But, for commit, deltacommit and replacecommits, it is in json. This PR replaces JSON with Avro bytes for all such commit metadata.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis is a storage format change. We need to make sure that older timeline with json metadata is still readable.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis commit is to add back the feature introduced in HUDI-5409, but changing the default value in the following snippet to true (=`ENABLE.defaultValue()`). Also, if the files partition is available, Hudi will use file index automatically regardless of the configuration.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (HoodieTableMetadataUtil.isFilesPartitionAvailable(tableMetaClient) || conf.getBoolean(ENABLE.key(), ENABLE.defaultValue())) {\r\n```\r\ninstead of false (=`DEFAULT_METADATA_ENABLE_FOR_READERS`) in https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/cc1c1e7b33d9c95e5a2ba0e9a1db428d1e1b2a00#diff-b5d22feda93e8704a70c470565b00af58729230c6a30b411a848b9605d0f4090R252\r\n```\r\nif (conf.getBoolean(ENABLE.key(), DEFAULT_METADATA_ENABLE_FOR_READERS) && HoodieTableMetadataUtil.isFilesPartitionAvailable(tableMetaClient)) {\r\n```\r\nto avoid the performance issue observed in HUDI-5411 (https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7526). In this way, users can set `hoodie.metadata.enabled` to `false` to get the same performance as Hudi 0.10.1 when reading non-metadata partitioned tables.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API change. No performance impact in default configuration.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNot required.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-29T09:44:56Z","updated_at":"2023-12-08T10:40:23Z","closed_at":"2023-11-21T16:24:37Z","merged_at":"2023-11-21T16:24:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"600fd4dbdf5e1e31b0f2ae9a5cea15c1153905fa","assignee":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production
