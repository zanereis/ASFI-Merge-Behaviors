What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Adds support for a ProtoKafkaSource based on RFC 57 \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds `PROTO`  to `Source.SourceType` enum\r\n  - Handles `PROTO` type in `SourceFormatAdapter` by converting to Avro from proto Message objects. Conversion to Row goes Proto -> Avro -> Row currently\r\n  - Added `ProtoClassBasedSchemaProvider` to generate schemas for a proto class that is currently on the classpath\r\n  - Added `ProtoKafkaSource` which parses byte[] into a class that is on the path\r\n  - Added `ProtoConversionUtil` which exposes methods for creating schemas and translating from Proto messages to Avro GenericRecords\r\n  - Added `KafkaSource` which provides a base class for the other Kafka sources to use\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n \r\n  - Added `TestProtoKafkaSource` to validate the flow from Kafka to Hudi\r\n  - Added a `BaseTestKafkaSource` to avoid repetition between the proto and json source testing\r\n  - Added `TestProtoClassBasedSchemaProvider` to validate schemas are properly generated\r\n  - Added `TestProtoConversionUtil` to validate the conversion from Proto to Avro is working as expected for all proto types\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-18T20:40:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T19:02:22Z","closed_at":"2022-09-01T15:33:21Z","merged_at":"2022-09-01T15:33:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"f5de4e434b33720d4846c6fe2450539a284ea14f","assignee":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/6135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/6135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/55997e718024a9ca75494b3db2fe5027003bf635","head":{"label":"the-other-tim-brown:HUDI-4418-proto-kafka-source","ref":"HUDI-4418-proto-kafka-source","sha":"55997e718024a9ca75494b3db2fe5027003bf635","user":{"login":"the-other-tim-brown","id":1360517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown","html_url":"https://github.com/the-other-tim-brown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":514061598,"node_id":"R_kgDOHqP1Hg","name":"hudi","full_name":"the-other-tim-brown/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"the-other-tim-brown","id":1360517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1360517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown","html_url":"https://github.com/the-other-tim-brown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the-other-tim-brown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"h

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently CompactionCommitSink commit or rollback logics doesn't take the writestatus error under consideration (only consider null writestatus), which actually will cause data loss when compacting the delta commit log files into the new versioned data files.\r\neg. org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieMergeHandle#writeRecord will lead to data loss from log files due to Exceptions.\r\n```java\r\n  protected boolean writeRecord(HoodieRecord<T> hoodieRecord, Option<IndexedRecord> indexedRecord, boolean isDelete) {\r\n    Option recordMetadata = hoodieRecord.getData().getMetadata();\r\n    if (!partitionPath.equals(hoodieRecord.getPartitionPath())) {\r\n      HoodieUpsertException failureEx = new HoodieUpsertException(\"mismatched partition path, record partition: \"\r\n          + hoodieRecord.getPartitionPath() + \" but trying to insert into partition: \" + partitionPath);\r\n      writeStatus.markFailure(hoodieRecord, failureEx, recordMetadata);\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    try {\r\n      if (indexedRecord.isPresent() && !isDelete) {\r\n        writeToFile(hoodieRecord.getKey(), (GenericRecord) indexedRecord.get(), preserveMetadata && useWriterSchemaForCompaction);\r\n        recordsWritten++;\r\n      } else {\r\n        recordsDeleted++;\r\n      }\r\n      writeStatus.markSuccess(hoodieRecord, recordMetadata);\r\n      // deflate record payload after recording success. This will help users access payload as a\r\n      // part of marking\r\n      // record successful.\r\n      hoodieRecord.deflate();\r\n      return true;\r\n    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n      LOG.error(\"Error writing record  \" + hoodieRecord, e);\r\n      writeStatus.markFailure(hoodieRecord, e, recordMetadata);\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nAnd it's known that StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator has related commit or rollback handle process. \r\n\r\nSo this pr will:\r\n\r\na)  Also add writestatus error as rollback reason for CompactionCommitSink compaction rollback to avoid data loss\r\n\r\nb) Unify the handle procedure for write commit policy with its implementions, as described in org.apache.hudi.commit.policy.WriteCommitPolicy, which is consolidated with that of StreamWriteOperatorCoordinator.\r\n\r\nc) All control whether data quality or ingestion stability should be in high priority through FlinkOptions#IGNORE_FAILED.\r\nAnd, we suggest that FlinkOptions#IGNORE_FAILED be **false** by default to avoid data loss.\r\n\r\nd) Optimize and fix some tiny bugs for log traces when commiting on error or rolling back.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nTo help avoid compaction data loss due to caught write errors.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the missing bloom filters in metadata table in the non-partitioned table due to incorrect record key generation.  Before this PR, the file name is wrong when generating the metadata payload for the bloom filter.  For example, below shows the file name used to construct the metadata payload:\r\n```\r\nFilename: 03656eb-c000-474b-945e-aa9298c3334d_1-0-1_0000001.parquet Bloom filter record key: DW/eaNVbRdo=xDmB/pnnQIMnCbUZywNZxw==\r\nFilename: f1a759f-8e00-4cc4-8af0-676d3c892657_1-0-1_0000002.parquet Bloom filter record key: DW/eaNVbRdo=t/6nT2vbZbsGoSkZBCOKZA==\r\nFilename: ca4aa60-2659-4fae-9d57-c4f51e8a7343_1-0-1_0000003.parquet Bloom filter record key: DW/eaNVbRdo=DsnvarlysKz9lJxfoZ81iA==\r\n```\r\nThe file name misses the first character.  In Bloom Index, when doing a lookup in the metadata table based on the actual file name, the corresponding bloom filter cannot be found because the record key generated during the lookup does not match what's stored in the metadata table, causing the upsert to fail:\r\n```\r\nBaseTableMetadata: BloomFilterIndex pair:  0f1a759f-8e00-4cc4-8af0-676d3c892657_1-0-1_0000002.parquet\r\nBaseTableMetadata: BloomFilterIndex pair:  eca4aa60-2659-4fae-9d57-c4f51e8a7343_1-0-1_0000003.parquet\r\n```\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieIndexException: Failed to get the bloom filter for (,0f1a759f-8e00-4cc4-8af0-676d3c892657_1-0-1_0000002.parquet)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.index.bloom.HoodieMetadataBloomIndexCheckFunction$BloomIndexLazyKeyCheckIterator.lambda$computeNext$2(HoodieMetadataBloomIndexCheckFunction.java:127)\r\n\tat java.util.HashMap.forEach(HashMap.java:1289)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.index.bloom.HoodieMetadataBloomIndexCheckFunction$BloomIndexLazyKeyCheckIterator.computeNext(HoodieMetadataBloomIndexCheckFunction.java:120)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.index.bloom.HoodieMetadataBloomIndexCheckFunction$BloomIndexLazyKeyCheckIterator.computeNext(HoodieMetadataBloomIndexCheckFunction.java:76)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.client.utils.LazyIterableIterator.next(LazyIterableIterator.java:119)\r\n\t... 15 more\r\n```\r\nThe fix is to generate the correct file name for the non-partitioned table.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Fixes the logic of generating file name for the non-partitioned table in `HoodieTableMetadataUtil`\r\n  - Adds unit tests for Bloom Index using metadata table, for both partitioned and non-partitioned table\r\n  - Fixes commit metadata generation for non-partitioned table\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unit tests for Bloom Index using metadata table so that all existing tests run in two setups, w/ and w/o using metadata table for column stats and bloom filters.  This PR also adds the tests for non-partitioned tables.  Before the fix, the tests for non-partitioned tables fail.  After the fix, the same set of tests succeeded.  The fix is verified to resolve the problem for upserts on S3 using Bloom Index with metadata table read.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn HoodieStreamingSink, if a microbatch gets committed in Hudi but spark checkpoint write fails, then Spark will retry and Hudi will rewrite the data. This causes data duplication. This PR makes the sink idempotent by adding the batchId to hudi commit metadata and then always checking the current batchId with the previously committed one, and skips if it's a retry.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix Hudi Presto query failures. The reason we saw java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: LOG during the presto query is because in this HoodieCopyOnWriteTableInputFormat class, it inherits field LOG from its parent class FileInputFormat which is a class from Hadoop.\r\n\r\nSo my understanding is in the compile time, it would reference this field from FileInputFormat.class. However, in the runtime, the presto doesn't have all the Hadoop classes in its classpath, what Presto uses is its own Hadoop dependency e.g. hadoop-apache2:jar:2.7.4-9. I checked that hadoop-apache2 does not have class FileInputFormat shaded which causes this runtime error.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nEnable row writer for clustering to improve performance\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n1. Integrate clustering with datasource read and write api, in this way,\r\n   - enable clustering use Dataset api\r\n   - Unify the read and write operations together, if read/write logic has improvement, clustering can also benefit\r\n2. Use hoodie.datasource.read.paths to pass paths for each clusteringOperation\r\n3. Introduce HoodieInternalWriteStatusCoordinator to persist the InternalWriteStatus of a clustering action. As we can not get it if using Spark datasource.\r\n4. Add new configures to control this behavior.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nManual test:\r\nA test table has 21 columns, 710716 rows, raw data size 929g(in spark memory), after compressed: 38.3g\r\nexecutor memory: 50g, 20 instances, and enable global_sort\r\n\r\nWithout clustering as row: 32mins, 12sec\r\nUsing clustering as row: 9mins, 51sec\r\nAlso change existing tests(`TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableClustering` and `testLayoutOptimizationFunctional`) to cover this feature \r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-05T09:58:46Z","updated_at":"2022-09-28T01:39:49Z","closed_at":"2022-09-22T13:17:09Z","merged_at":"2022-09-22T13:17:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e624698f78f4707d62c7f26b044a69a250aae43","assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"xiarixiaoyao","id":13514703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE0NzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13514703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao","html_url":"https://github.com/xiarixiaoyao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiarixiaoyao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"XuQianJin-Stars","id":10494131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk0MTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10494131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars","html_url":"https://github.com/XuQianJin-Stars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XuQianJin-Stars/received_events","type":"User","user_vie

request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nImprove schema reconciliation to make it more flexible in presence of full schema evolution being enabled.\r\n\r\njust like the feature  https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-update.html#-merge-schema-evolution\r\n\r\nDesired behavior:\r\n\r\n1) incoming data has missing columns that were already defined in the table –> null values will be injected into missing columns \r\n2) incoming data contains new columns not defined yet in the table -> columns will be added to the table schema (incoming dataframe?)\r\n3) incoming data has missing columns that are already defined in the table and new columns not yet defined in the table -> new columns will be added to the table schema, missing columns will be injected with null values\r\n4) No column should be dropped when using hive sync utility when schema reconciliation is enabled.\r\n5) support nested fields.\r\n\r\n\r\neg:\r\n\r\n<html

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes file-listing sequence of the Metadata Table to make sure it's on par or better than FS-based file-listing\r\n\r\nChange log:\r\n  - Cleaned up avoidable instantiations of Hadoop's `Path`\r\n  - Replaced `new Path` w/ `createUnsafePath` where possible\r\n  - Cached `TimestampFormatter`, `DateFormatter` for timezone\r\n  - Avoid loading defaults in Hadoop conf when init-ing HFile reader\r\n  - Avoid re-instantiating `BaseTableMetadata` twice w/in `BaseHoodieTableFileIndex`\r\n  - Avoid looking up FileSystem for every partition when listing partitioned table, instead do it just once\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee above \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is

`HoodieActiveTimeline.parseDateFromInstantTimeSafely` for parsing timestamp when output metrics\r\n  - Add a test method `testInvalidInstantDateParsing` in `TestHoodieActiveTimeline` for `HoodieActiveTimeline.parseDateFromInstantTimeSafely`\r\n  - Replace `HoodieActiveTimeline.parseDateFromInstantTime` with `parseDateFromInstantTimeSafely` in `SparkRDDWriteClient` and `BaseHoodieWriteClient` when output metrics\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *ITTestHoodieDemo.testParquetDemo*.\r\n\r\nMinor change, and can be verified manually in method `ITTestHoodieDemo.testParquetDemo`\r\n\r\n  - Enable metrics in test method `ITTestHoodieDemo.testParquetDemo`\r\n  - The old code will fail in method `ingestFirstBatchAndHiveSync()` when DeltaStreamer do the bootstrap when execute `bootstrapCmds` at ` executeCommandStringsInDocker(ADHOC_1_CONTAINER, bootstrapCmds);`\r\n  - The fixed code will pass in the test method `ITTestHoodieDemo.testParquetDemo` when metrics on\r\n  - And there is a test method for verifying `TestHoodieActiveTimeline.testInvalidInstantDateParsing`\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [x] Necessary doc changes done or
