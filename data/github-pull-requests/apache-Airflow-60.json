Now we have this as `lineage_parent_id` function:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/30f7b2abe6991fe6e565f17f7d0701e80ecba0d3/airflow/providers/openlineage/plugins/macros.py#L60-L66\r\n\r\nSo as a job name, we get the UUID instead of `dag_id.task_id`. After the change, we will be able to easily create ParentRunFacet:\r\n```python\r\nparent_id = lineage_parent_id(task_instance)\r\nparent_namespace, parent_job_name, parent_run_id = parent_id.split(\"/\")\r\nparent_run_facet = ParentRunFacet.create(parent_run_id, parent_job_name, parent_namespace)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, we are extracting the namespace again in macros module, when we have one already extracted in adapter module, and this one is used in events so we should use the same one here.\r\n\r\n## Important\r\nI am not sure if removing the `run_id` from the macro is a breaking change. We could probably leave it there, but there is no real use in it i think.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

absence of task names in the DAG details API necessitates separate calls for task and DAG information, hindering process efficiency.\r\nclose #37564\r\n\r\nUse case/motivation\r\nCurrently, task names are not included in the DAG details API endpoint. Tasks represent the execution component of a DAG also various API endpoints require task names. Therefore, to retrieve task names, one must query the \"/dags/{dag_id}/tasks\" endpoint. Additionally, to obtain basic DAG details, the \"/dags/{dag_id}/details\" endpoint is utilized. In my use case, automation of certain processes necessitates both DAG information and task names. Consequently, the need to utilize two separate API endpoints slows down the overall process, particularly considering the multitude of DAGs. It would be advantageous to consolidate this information into a single API call, considering that tasks are integral part of a DAG.\r\n\r\nApproach\r\nAdded new schema\"DAGDetailSchemaWithTasksInfo\" to DagSchema.py for task ID information. To include tasks, we have to add a query parameter

CI workflow yaml had become a huge flying-spaghetti-monster piece of monolitic workflow, with lots of a duplication. This is the first step (of quite a few) where we separate parts of the workflow to micro-workflows.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions has the option to call workflows from other workflows and (additionally to composite actions) such composite workflows can implement a nice workflow code reuse.\r\n\r\nThis - first- attempt is to check if we can do it easily and it should be followed by a series of similar extraction steps.\r\n\r\nFor now we have prod image steps repeated from the composite\r\naction in the workflow - this is much better as you can see\r\nseparate steps in the running jobs (with composite actions, they\r\nare all in a single step). This helps to see what's going on with\r\nthe image build. But finally we will also use the new workflows\r\nin the \"Pull Request target\" and we will remove the composite\r\naction altogether.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

TIs are assumed to log to the \"airflow.task\" logger.  TaskInstance was configuring this in the \"reconstructor\", a sqlalchemy thing that is processed on loading from DB.  But there's no equivalent for Pydantic models, and when running a task with TaskInstancePydantic, the wrong logger was used (fully qualified class name).  When looking for a solution, I saw that LoggingMixin will check `_logger_name` and if set will use it.

we handled serialization of TaskInstance and DagRun, converting to the respective pydantic model. E.g. we give a TI and it comes out as TaskInstancePydantic.  But when we passed TaskInstancePydantic to the serializer, we did not encode it, so it hit the default \"encoding\" which is to simply stringify it.  With this change, TaskInstancePydantic will serialize to TaskInstancePydantic,

going through various stages of installation of Airlfow in CI and PROD image, we check several times if the packaging tools of ours are installed and if they are installed in the right version. This is in order to make sure that none of the installation steps upgraded them accidentaly (might happen when --eager upgrade of pip or --highest resolution of uv are used).\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the speed of that (rather than installing the packages again, we just check which version is already installed).\r\n\r\nSimilarly when constraints are already downloaded, we do not re-download them again.\r\n\r\nAlso this change makes a consisten rename of the installation scripts to reflect we have not only pip but also uv as packaging tool and installs both `uv` and `pip` regardless which packaging tool we are using - which gives anyone an opportunity to use either of the two tools if they wish.\r\n\r\nDiagnostics is a bit nicer - rather than complaining with error when uv is missing, prints information that it's not installed. We only show traces of installation command (pip and uv) with `set -x` commands for diagnostics - we do not show details of other internal commands.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

the change to switch to uv, we skipped constraints being used in CI image - in effect all PR were not using constraints, but they were using not constraint dependencues but lowest-direct mode of installation so direct dependencies would not be upgraded in such case, only the transitive ones, so the risk of failure was anyhow small even if someone released a new, breakong dependency.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `uv` currently does not support installing constraints from URL. We had been silently failing back to the \"no-constraints\" way in such case (this is default mode if for any reason constraint build fail in such case.\r\n\r\nIt introduced the risk that in case 3rd-party breaking dependency was released it would also start breaking regular PRs, not only the \"canary\" build.\r\n\r\nWe fix it by downloading constraints locally when they are remote and using them from there.\r\n\r\nWhile this is being worked on in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2081 and likely to land in uv 0.1.14, it's also a good idea to actually download the constraints and keep them around - this might be handy if you want to later use constraints to install \"golden\" set of dependencies wihtout necessity to build the right URL - you can always use `${HOME}/constraints.txt`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it and also changes the fallback mechanism to perform the lowest-direct upgrade only in case the constraint build fails, rather than always run the lowest-dirct upgrade even if constraints install works fine - this will make sure that most PRs are using exactly the constraint version of the dependencies (at least the version of constraints that were generated last time when pyproject.toml changed).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This operator allows you to use the AzureDataLakeStorageV2Hook without the need to write custom python code to interact with the Hook. \r\n\r\nThere is already a LocalFilesystemToADLSOperator which uses the older AzureDataLakeHook, but that operator doesn't allow you to directly store an XCom to Fabric, you need to create a local file first before uploading it, which in this case would mean creating an additional task to do it while in fact it's not necessary as the AzureDataLakeStorageV2Hook allows you to achieve the same without that intermediate step.\r\n\r\nThat's why I introduced this DataToADLSOperator, we already use it at our company as a custom operator and it works great as this easily allows you to upload an XCom to Fabric, without the need to write python code interacting with the AzureDataLakeStorageV2Hook.  This means a more consice DAG, less code which improves readability and reduces complexity and of course makes it easy to use.\r\n\r\nHere is a simplified example on how to use the operator:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.jira_plugin import JiraOperator\r\nfrom airflow.providers.microsoft.azure.transfers.data_to_local import DataToADLSOperator\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\ndefault_args = {\r\n    'owner': 'airflow',\r\n    'start_date': datetime(2024, 1, 1),\r\n}\r\n\r\nwith DAG('jira_example_dag', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval=None) as dag:\r\n    create_issue_task = JiraOperator(\r\n        task_id='create_issue',\r\n        jira_conn_id='jira_connection',\r\n        method='POST',\r\n        endpoint='issue',\r\n        json={\r\n            'fields': {\r\n                'project': {'key': 'PROJ'},\r\n                'summary': 'This is a test issue created from Airflow',\r\n                'description': 'This is the description of the test issue.',\r\n                'issuetype': {'name': 'Task'},\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n\tdag=dag,\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    get_issue_task = JiraOperator(\r\n        task_id='get_issue',\r\n        jira_conn_id='jira_connection',\r\n        method='GET',\r\n        endpoint='issue/AIRFLOW-123',\r\n\tdag=dag,\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    write_to_azure_task = DataToADLSOperator(\r\n

PR introduces a joint way to treat the .local (--user) folder\r\nas both - venv and `--user` package installation. It fixes a number\r\nof problems the `--user` installation created us in the past and\r\ndoes it in fully backwards compatible way.\r\n\r\nThis improves both \"production\" use for end user as well as local\r\niteration on the PROD image during tests - but also for CI.\r\n\r\nImprovements for \"end user\":\r\n\r\n* user does not have to use `pip install --user` to install new\r\n  packages any more and it is not enabled by default with PIP_USER\r\n  flag.\r\n\r\n* users can use uv to install packages when they extend the image\r\n  (but it's not obligatory - pip continues working as it did)\r\n\r\n* users can use `uv` to build custom production image, which gives\r\n  40%-50% saving for image build time compring to `pip`.\r\n\r\n* python -m venv --system-site-packages continues to use the\r\n  .local packages from the .local installation (and not uses\r\n  them if --system-site-packages is not used) - so we have full\r\n  compatibility with previous images.\r\n\r\nImprovements for development:\r\n\r\n* when image is built from sources (no --use-docker-context-files\r\n  are specified), airflow is installed in --editable mode, which\r\n  means that airflow + all providers are installed locally from\r\n  airflow sources, not from packages - which means that both\r\n  airflow and providers have the latest version inside the\r\n  prod image.\r\n\r\n* when local sources changes and you want to run k8s tests locally,\r\n  it is now WAY faster (several minutes) to iterate with your changes\r\n  because you do not have to rebuild the base image - the only thing\r\n  needed is to copy sources to the PROD image to \"/opt/airflow\" which\r\n  is where editable installlation is done from. You only need to\r\n  rebuild the image if dependencies change.\r\n\r\n* By default `uv` is used for local source build for k8s tests so\r\n  even if you have to rebuild it, it is way faster (60%-80%) during\r\n  iterating with the image.\r\n\r\nCI/DEV tooling improvements:\r\n\r\n* this PR switches to use `uv` by default for most prod images we\r\n  build in CI, but it adds a check if the image still builds with `pip`.\r\n\r\n* we also switch to more PEP standard way of installing packages\r\n  from local filesystem (package-name @ file:///FILE)\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/37785\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/37815\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR optimizes image building together with upgrading to the new `uv` release 0.1.12. The relese introduces `--python` flag that adds the possibility of installing packages in non-venv environments (which our CI image are) without pretending it's a virtualenv.\r\n\r\nIt also removes a long standing workaround where we needed to preinstall some python packages for mysql installation - this is not needed any more and we can move PIP and UV args after installing system dependencies which brings back optimized experience of not having to reinstall system packages when only `pip` or `uv` version changes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Depends on and blocked by https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37784~~ <= merged\r\n\r\nOnce the external_executor_id bug is fixed, this will add the feature to adopt abandoned tasks in the ECS Executor.   To test, you can launch an ECS Executor environment and run a dag which takes a few minutes.  While it is running, kill the scheduler.  Before this change, when you restart the scheduler, the existing ECS job will be terminated and rescheduled/restarted.  After this change, the running task will be adopted; it will finish and be monitored as if it was launched by this executor/scheduler instance.\r\n\r\nWas previously https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36803\r\n\r\ncloses: #35491\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This change will only overwrite that field if another is provided.\r\n\r\nAdded some asserts to an existing unit test and added some new tests to verify behavior and prevent regression. \r\n\r\n@jedcunningham - this is the bug you helped me repro\r\n\r\n## NOTE:  This PR is blocking https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37786 and must be merged first.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR adds the ability to support adding custom TI Deps for more flexible TI scheduling.\r\n\r\nIt adds one more attributes `TI_SCHEDULE_DECISION` to the class `BaseTIDep`. If a custom TI Dep class is defined with `TI_SCHEDULE_DECISION=True`, this custom TI Dep will be used by the DagRun object to decide if a TI is schedulable (for this purpose, a parameter `ti_schedule_decision` is needed in the `DepContext` class).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

outdated Flask-SQLalchemy) then everything seems works fine, as soon as I return to the default value then it fail with random error, seems like Flask-Session 0.6.0 miss some commit to the DB, and

It is only required until we have Python 3.9 as min version, and do not use `airflow.compat.functools.cache` in code base.\r\n- There is couple of places where cache used into the Airflow core, some of them might be a result of memory leakage, the simple way is use `methodtools.lru_cache` - this one would not breaks public interfaces or behaviour and do no required to rewrite. In another word we have bug fix \"Here and Now\" instead of think how to rewrite without additional dependency.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

have now two installers - pip and uv and we want to upgrade them manually and get notified about it, but also we want to do it as easy as possible.\r\n\r\nThis change builds on our canary build update checks - it uses manual pre-commits to check for latest versions and fail in the canary run if new versions are available, it also allows to run the same pre-commit command locally to upgrade to the new versions. This way we will be quickly notified when there is a new version of either `pip` or `uv` released and we will be able to manually run pre-commit (and fix things if needed) after upgrading the installer versions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

have now two installers - pip and uv and we want to upgrade them manually and get notified about it, but also we want to do it as easy as possible.\r\n\r\nThis change builds on our canary build update checks - it uses manual pre-commits to check for latest versions and fail in the canary run if new versions are available, it also allows to run the same pre-commit command locally to upgrade to the new versions. This way we will be quickly notified when there is a new version of either `pip` or `uv` released and we will be able to manually run PR (and fix things if needed) after upgrading the installer versions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

have a customized image that uses `continuumio/miniconda3:4.12.0` as its `PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE`. The `python --version` in the said Conda distribution outputs:\r\n```\r\nPython 3.9.18 | packaged by conda-forge | (9c4f8ef1, Jan 30 2024, 18:27:40)\r\n[PyPy 7.3.15 with GCC 12.3.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `Dockerfile` this is piped to `cut -d \" \" -f 2 | cut -d \".\" -f 1-2`. The result is this:\r\n```\r\n3.9\r\n7.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result the `AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINTS_LOCATION` becomes:\r\n```\r\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.5.3/constraints-3.9%0A7.3.txt\r\n```\r\n(The `%0A` is a URL-encoded new line)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe python version is retrieved in 3 places in the `Dockerfile`. One uses `sys.version_info`, two use `python --version` with pipe/cut. I suggest for `sys.version_info` to be used consistently in all 3 places, as it gives a more predictable result.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

were a few small issues with provider metadata:\r\n\r\n* new providers that have never been included in constraints got 2.0.0 version of airflow associated\r\n* providers that were present in constraints of several airflow versions got associated with the \"latest\" version that got them in constraints\r\n* provider's metadata generation was serialized and took a bit more than a minute to run - which was pretty slow\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all those issues:\r\n\r\n* providers which were never included in constraints are added to the first version of airflow released after the provider version was released\r\n* if there is no version of airflow released yet after provider is released, the provider got associated with latest released version of airflow\r\n* when provider is present in multiple constraints, provider is associated with the OLDEST airflow release that had it in constraints\r\n* we are using multiprocessing to run provider metadata retrieval in parallel - effectively speeding up the retrieval (after airflow versions were retrieved and constraints refreshed) to less than 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under
