It separates the increasing number of configuration options into two columns. Also, to assist in splitting configuration input into logically related pieces as well as be consistent with the configuration of other components, the Comments section was moved to its own tab. This presents better in the UI and keeps the Apply button easily accessible without the need to scroll (for most display resolutions.)\r\n\r\nThe PR includes additional details when mouse-over/hover the new \"?\" icon for several of the Process Group properties to explicitly clarify that the default connections settings apply only to new connections - not existing connections. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nInstalled NiFi on several different platforms each having a different display size and resolution.

One for the controller services and the other for the processor.\r\n\r\nSo I propose to mutualize the value.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11908](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11908) Updates the GitHub workflow Maven HTTP settings to use the native client settings instead of the Maven Wagon properties.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of Maven Wrapper using Maven 3.9, the native HTTP transport is now the default, as described in the [Maven 3.9 Release Notes](https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.0/release-notes.html#potentially-breaking-core-changes-if-migrating-from-3-8-x).\r\n\r\nThese changes replace the Maven Wagon properties with a subset of the analogous properties for the Maven [Artifact Resolver](https://maven.apache.org/resolver/configuration.html).\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing the `disableXmlReport` argument, which is deprecated in recent versions of the Maven Surefire Plugin.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X]

Previously any bulletin that fired was added to the metric registry however the registry was never updated, giving a false sense that the bulletin is still firing. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n1. Create a flow which would generate an error.  For example the flow below uses ConsumeTwitter and LogAttribute with ConsumeTwitter bearer token misconfigured purposefully. Do not start the flow.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1773\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/nifi/assets/1371858/b0e00c73-b529-4825-abdd-7d47d1c7ae5d\">\r\n\r\n2. Capture current metrics available using the Prometheus metrics api endpoint (e.g. https://127.0.0.1:8443/nifi-api/flow/metrics/prometheus) and search output to confirm that the nifi_bulletin metric does not appear, indicating there are no bulletins present\r\n\r\n4. Start flow and confirm that bulletins showing an error/warning is present\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1773\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/nifi/assets/1371858/3cd295ea-e92b-4f15-b51d-7c7b0702deb5\">\r\n\r\n5. On the metrics endpoint confirm that the nifi_bulletin metrics appear with values corresponding to each component demonstrating an error. With the example flow metrics show a single metric entry with a value of 1\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1773\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/nifi/assets/1371858/210a8d8d-25a9-4505-be1e-ba028331c039\">\r\n\r\n6. Stop the flow and await for bulletins to clear from the UI\r\n\r\n7. Confirm on metrics endpoint that nifi_bulletin metric no longer appears or no longer contains the specific bulletin that was created\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11896) Corrects QuestDB Status Repository shutdown handling at runtime and during unit tests.\r\n\r\nChanges include updating the repository start and shutdown methods to track scheduled future tasks and attempt cancellation before shutting down the executor service. This approach provides a stronger guarantee of stopping scheduled tasks than shutting down the executor service itself.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include setting the initial delay for scheduled tasks from 0 to the configured interval, avoiding initial execution when starting the repository. This approach avoids unnecessary task execution in unit tests.\r\n\r\nTest changes include setting the `out` System property pointing to the QuestDB logging configuration, avoiding unnecessary debug logs during unit testing, which can corrupt the console output stream, described in [NIFI-11897](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11897).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11889](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11889) Adds a `Transmission Strategy` property to `PutTCP` enabling either `FlowFile-oriented` or `Record-oriented` processing. The change maintains the current default behavior of FlowFile-oriented processing.\r\n\r\nThe new `Record-oriented` strategy requires `Record Reader` and `Record Writer` properties, and disables the Message Delimiter and Character Set properties, when configured.\r\n\r\nThe `Record-oriented` strategy enables conversion from one record format to another during processing, supporting high-volume flows. Similar results can be achieved using `ConvertRecord` prior to `PutTCP`, but supporting record-orienting handling in PutTCP avoids intermediate processing.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that record-oriented processing does not provide application-level delivery guarantees. This approach may be suitable for flows that can tolerate data duplication.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

This provides a better location to provide comments as they apply to a particular rule. The only alternative is to document Rules in the Comments tab of the processor. This is too far removed from the Rule to be easy to associate the comment with the Rule - and is highly susceptible to the comment becoming stale relative to rule changes.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11877](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11877)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\nThis PR is largely a UI feature. Add Rules in the Advanced UI of UpdateAttribute. Comments are able to be added and persist. Also, when creating a new Rule based on an existing Rule, the Comments field carries forward.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 17\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\n- [ ] New dependencies are compatible with the [Apache License 2.0](https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) according to the [License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html)\r\n- [ ] New dependencies are documented in applicable `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] Documentation formatting

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11874](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11874)\r\nUI modification for the layout of Process Group configuration.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-7505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-7505) - Add a record-based processor that executes an HTTP request for each record in a flowfile. Many of the options are similar to the InvokeHTTP processor's, but adapted for record-based operation.\r\n\r\nRequest attributes like the URL, headers and request body can vary per record, using RecordPath queries to extract data from each input record. The response body and various metadata (headers, status code, etc) can be written to each record.\r\n\r\nThe processor can be configured to route the entire input flowfile to a failure relationship if an error is encountered, or failing records can be split off into a separate flowfile. HTTP requests can be retried a configurable number of times.\r\n\r\nThe response body can optionally be parsed using a record reader service. As well as allowed the parsed body to be included in the output record, in this mode the response body can also be used to determine whether the request is treated as having succeed or failed. This can be useful for APIs that always return a 200 status code, with error information in the response body.\r\n\r\nThis PR isn't complete yet (it still needs tests), but I've created it in case anybody has any feedback on the approach I'm taking.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11780](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11780) Adds X.509 Client Certificate Subject Alternative Name attributes to `HandleHttpRequest` FlowFiles.\r\n\r\n`HandleHttpRequest` provides the certificate subject and issuer values when a client sends a request using mutual TLS, and these changes enumerate and add FlowFile attributes for all Subject Alternative Names. X.509 certificates may have zero or more Subject Alternative Names, so the implementation uses an indexed naming convention to include the SAN value and name type. [RFC 3280 Section 4.1.2.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3280#section-4.2.1.7) defines standard General Name types for SANs, and the FlowFile attributes follow that naming convention. For example, a client certificate containing a DNS Name and an Email Address will produce the following attributes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp.certificate.sans.0.name = username@localhost.localdomain\r\nhttp.certificate.sans.0.nameType = rfc822Name\r\nhttp.certificate.sans.1.name = localhost.localdomain\r\nhttp.certificate.sans.1.nameType = dNSName\r\n```\r\nAttribute index ordering is based on the order defined in the client certificate itself.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11845](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11845) Adds support for migrating from either H2 1.4 or 2.1 to the current version 2.2. This migration support enables seamless upgrades from existing NiFi deployments, including version 1.15.0 and earlier with H2 1.4, and deployments of 1.16.0 through 1.22.0 with H2 2.1.\r\n\r\nH2 2.1 introduced changes to the internal database format, including references to `org.h2` package names for certain value types. H2 2.2 introduced additional format changes, incrementing the format version from `2` to `3`.\r\n\r\nPrevious migration support from 1.4 to 2.1 used a shaded version of H2 1.4 for reading existing databases. The updated migration approach uses the same shaded library strategy, introducing `v14` and `v21` modules for the shaded H2 version.\r\n\r\nImprovements include a new `DatabaseVersionReader` which attempts to determine the database version based on the `format:` field in the H2 binary file header. The Reader maps the format version to the driver version for subsequent processing.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include the `DatabaseRepackager`, which supports reading H2 2.1 files and replacing `org.h2` package name references with the shaded package names. This approach allow runtime reflection operations to work when reading and exporting H2 files from NiFi 1.16.0 through NiFi 1.22.0.\r\n\r\nH2 migration supports both NiFi and NiFi Registry databases.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi
