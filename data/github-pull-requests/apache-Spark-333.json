View is not supported for `ALTER ADD COLUMNS`\r\n\r\n2. Since tables created in SparkSQL with Hive DDL syntax will populate table properties with schema information, we need make sure the consistency of the schema before and after ALTER operation in order for future use. \r\n\r\n3. For embedded-schema type of format, such as `parquet`, we need to make sure that the predicate on the newly-added columns can be evaluated properly, or pushed down properly. In case of the data file does not have the columns for the newly-added columns, such predicates should return as if the column values are NULLs. \r\n\r\n4. For datasource table, this feature does not support the following:\r\n4.1 TEXT format, since there is only one default column `value` is inferred for text format data. \r\n4.2 ORC format, since SparkSQL native ORC reader does not support the difference between user-specified-schema and inferred schema from ORC files. \r\n4.3 Third party datasource types that implements RelationProvider, including the built-in JDBC format, since different implementations by the vendors may have different ways to dealing with schema. \r\n4.4 Other datasource types, such as `parquet`, `json`, `csv`, `hive` are supported. \r\n\r\n5. Column names being added can not be duplicate of any existing data column or partition column names. Case sensitivity is taken into consideration according to the sql configuration. \r\n\r\n6. This feature also supports In-Memory catalog, while Hive support is turned off. \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test cases

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have a table relation plan cache in `HiveMetastoreCatalog`, which caches a lot of things: file status, resolved data source, inferred schema, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't make sense to limit this cache with hive support, we should move it to SQL core module so that users can use this cache without hive support.\r\n\r\nIt can also reduce the size of `HiveMetastoreCatalog`, so that it's easier to remove it eventually.\r\n\r\nmain changes:\r\n1. move the table relation cache to `SessionCatalog`\r\n2. `SessionCatalog.lookupRelation` will return `SimpleCatalogRelation` and the analyzer will convert it to `LogicalRelation` or `MetastoreRelation` later, then `HiveSessionCatalog` doesn't need to override `lookupRelation` anymore\r\n3. `FindDataSourceTable` will read/write the table relation cache.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn current `DAGScheduler handleTaskCompletion` code, when event.reason is `Success`, it will first do `stage.pendingPartitions -= task.partitionId`, which maybe a bug when `FetchFailed` happens.\r\n\r\n**Think about below**\r\n\r\n1.  Stage 0 runs and generates shuffle output data.\r\n2. Stage 1 reads the output from stage 0 and generates more shuffle data. It has two tasks: ShuffleMapTask1 and ShuffleMapTask2, and these tasks are launched on executorA.\r\n3. ShuffleMapTask1 fails to fetch blocks locally and sends a FetchFailed to the driver. The driver marks executorA as lost and updates failedEpoch;\r\n4. The driver resubmits stage 0 so the missing output can be re-generated, and then once it completes, resubmits stage 1 with ShuffleMapTask1x and ShuffleMapTask2x.\r\n5. ShuffleMapTask2 (from the original attempt of stage 1) successfully finishes on executorA and sends Success back to driver. This causes DAGScheduler::handleTaskCompletion to remove partition 2 from stage.pendingPartitions (line 1149), but it does not add the partition to the set of output locations (line 1192), because the task’s epoch is less than the failure epoch for the executor (because of the earlier failure on executor A)\r\n6. ShuffleMapTask1x successfully finishes on executorB, causing the driver to remove partition 1 from stage.pendingPartitions. Combined with the previous step, this means that there are no more pending partitions for the stage, so the DAGScheduler marks the stage as finished (line 1196). However, the shuffle stage is not available (line 1215) because the completion for ShuffleMapTask2 was ignored because of its epoch, so the DAGScheduler resubmits the stage.\r\n7. ShuffleMapTask2x is still running, so when TaskSchedulerImpl::submitTasks is called for the re-submitted stage, it throws an error, because there’s an existing active task set\r\n\r\n**In this fix**\r\n\r\nAdd a check if there is already active(not zombie) taskSetManager before resubmission.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test in.","created_at":"2017-01-17T17:02:27Z","updated_at":"2017-02-18T14:59:25Z","closed_at":"2017-02-18T14:58:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e46a1afe1eaa58ab851d9eb1edf2b3180a7aa52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16620/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16620/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16620/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6809d1ff5d09693e961087da35c8f6b3b50fe53c","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-19263","ref":"SPARK-19263","sha":"6809d1ff5d09693e961087da35c8f6b3b50fe53c","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

Issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19260\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. “spark.history.fs.logDirectory” supports with space character and “%20” characters.\r\n2. As usually, if the run classpath includes hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml files, the supplied path eg.\"/test\" which does not contain a scheme should be taken as a HDFS path rather than a local path since the path parameter is a Hadoop dir.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdate Unit Test and take some manual tests\r\n\r\nlocal:\r\n.sbin/start-history-server.sh \"file:/a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOn CREATE/ALTER a view, it's no longer needed to generate a SQL text string from the LogicalPlan, instead we store the SQL query text、the output column names of the query plan, and current database to CatalogTable. Permanent views created by this approach can be resolved by current view resolution approach.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage includes:\r\n1. If you update an underlying view, the current view also gets updated;\r\n2. That gives us a change to get ride of SQL generation for operators.\r\n\r\nMajor changes of this PR:\r\n1. Generate the view-specific properties(e.g. view default database, view query output column names) during permanent view creation and store them as properties in the CatalogTable;\r\n2. Update the commands `CreateViewCommand` and `AlterViewAsCommand`, get rid of SQL generation from them.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes two types of APIs as below:\r\n\r\n### Array as an option value in readers/writers\r\n\r\nAs an concrete implementation to use it, multiple values for `nullValue` is dealt with here together (SPARK-17878).\r\n\r\n**Python** - `list`/`tuple` of any object that can be converted into string\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.read.format('csv') \\\r\n    .option(\"nullValue\", ['Tom', 'Joe']) \\\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Scala** - `Seq[String]`\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.format(\"csv\")\r\n  .option(\"nullValue\", Seq(\"2012\", \"Tesla\", \"null\"))\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Java** - `String[]`\r\n\r\n```java\r\nspark.read().format(\"csv\")\r\n  .option(\"nullValue\", new String[]{\"\", \"null\", \"NA\"})\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SQL** - Python's list-like form of integer, decimal, string and boolean \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tableA USING csv\r\nOPTIONS (nullValue [2012, 1.1, 'null'], ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Unsets an option in readers/writers\r\n\r\n**Scala**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.unsetOption(\"optionKey\")\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Java**\r\n\r\n```java\r\nspark.read().unsetOption(\"optionKey\")\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Python**\r\n\r\n```java\r\nspark.read.unsetOption(\"optionKey\")\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case of R, there seems requiring a quite bit of more changes. It will be a follow-up.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in each suite and manually.","created_at":"2017-01-17T09:16:31Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:37:49Z","closed_at":"2017-12-30T10:15:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c25a608644ff1fb97a69e74b828cf4205eae256c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16611/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16611/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16611/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c1a012e5cad648e81797ec494f44392189560ce","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-17967","ref":"SPARK-17967","sha":"4c1a012e5cad648e81797ec494f44392189560ce","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `TaskMemoryManager `, when we acquire memory by calling `acquireExecutionMemory` and we can't acquire required memory, we will try to spill other memory consumers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we simply iterates the memory consumers in a hash set. Normally each time the consumer will be iterated in the same order.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is that we might spill additional consumers. For example, if consumer 1 uses 10MB, consumer 2 uses 50MB, then consumer 3 acquires 100MB but we can only get 60MB and spilling is needed. We might spill both consumer 1 and consumer 2. But we actually just need to spill consumer 2 and get the required 100MB.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is that if we spill consumer 1 in first time spilling. After a while, consumer 1 now uses 5MB. Then consumer 4 may acquire some memory and spilling is needed again. Because we iterate the memory consumers in the same order, we will spill consumer 1 again. So for consumer 1, we will produce many small spilling files.\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies the way iterating the memory consumers. It sorts the memory consumers by their memory usage. So the consumer using more memory will spill first. Once it is spilled, even it acquires few memory again, in next time spilling happens it will not be the consumers to spill again if there are other consumers using more memory than it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-16T13:32:11Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:24Z","closed_at":"2017-02-03T14:16:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4726d76ebd90cf795ecf08a3d0f4b2f2b2f7f8cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e41c6bdee18a4ab705bd8e1373ce09f421ca91c1","head":{"label":"viirya:sort-memoryconsumer-when-spill","ref":"sort-memoryconsumer-when-spill","sha":"e41c6bdee18a4ab705bd8e1373ce09f421ca91c1","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen DStreamGraph is generating a job, it will hold a lock and block other APIs. Because StreamingJobProgressListener (numInactiveReceivers, streamName(streamId: Int), streamIds) needs to call DStreamGraph's methods to access some information, the UI may hang if generating a job is very slow (e.g., talking to the slow Kafka cluster to fetch metadata).\r\nIt's better to optimize the locks in DStreamGraph and StreamingJobProgressListener to make the UI not block by job generation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting ut\r\n\r\ncc @zsxwing

DataFrameWriter and Catalog. However, the support is not completed, there are still some cases we do not support.\r\n\r\nthis PR provide DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable work with hive format to create partitioned table.\r\n\r\n## How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSo far, the test cases in DDLSuites only verify the behaviors of InMemoryCatalog. That means, they do not cover the scenarios using HiveExternalCatalog. Thus, we need to improve the existing test suite to run these cases using Hive metastore.\r\n\r\nWhen porting these test cases, a bug of `SET LOCATION` is found. `path` is not set when the location is changed. \r\n\r\nAfter this PR, a few changes are made, as summarized below,\r\n- `DDLSuite` becomes an abstract class. Both `InMemoryCatalogedDDLSuite` and `HiveCatalogedDDLSuite` extend it. `InMemoryCatalogedDDLSuite` is using `InMemoryCatalog`. `HiveCatalogedDDLSuite` is using `HiveExternalCatalog`.\r\n- `InMemoryCatalogedDDLSuite` contains all the existing test cases in `DDLSuite`. \r\n- `HiveCatalogedDDLSuite` contains a subset of `DDLSuite`. The following test cases are excluded:\r\n\r\n1. The following test cases only make sense for `InMemoryCatalog`:\r\n```\r\n  test(\"desc table for parquet data source table using in-memory catalog\")\r\n  test(\"create a managed Hive source table\") {\r\n  test(\"create an external Hive source table\")\r\n  test(\"Create Hive Table As Select\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The following test cases are unable to be ported because we are unable to alter table provider when using Hive metastore. In the future PRs we need to improve the test cases so that altering table provider is not needed:\r\n```\r\n  test(\"alter table: set location (datasource table)\")\r\n  test(\"alter table: set properties (datasource table)\")\r\n  test(\"alter table: unset properties (datasource table)\")\r\n  test(\"alter table: set serde (datasource table)\")\r\n  test(\"alter table: set serde partition (datasource table)\")\r\n  test(\"alter table: change column (datasource table)\")\r\n  test(\"alter table: add partition (datasource table)\")\r\n  test(\"alter table: drop partition (datasource table)\")\r\n  test(\"alter table: rename partition (datasource table)\")\r\n  test(\"drop table - data source table\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TODO** : in the future PRs, we need to remove `HiveDDLSuite` and move the test cases to either `DDLSuite`,  `InMemoryCatalogedDDLSuite` or `HiveCatalogedDDLSuite`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A","created_at":"2017-01-16T05:25:06Z","updated_at":"2018-01-13T18:20:53Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T07:14:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3496ad326455bede7d3989c9fab146825792fd55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9d4211cf8c1613090896f5b19dbd4054ff16d949","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:refactorDDLSuite","ref":"refactorDDLSuite","sha":"9d4211cf8c1613090896f5b19dbd4054ff16d949","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor some datasources which are based on HadoopRDD or NewHadoopRDD, such as spark-xml, InputFileBlockHolder doesn't work with Python UDF.\r\n\r\nThe method to reproduce it is, running the following codes with `bin/pyspark --packages com.databricks:spark-xml_2.11:0.4.1`:\r\n\r\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import udf,input_file_name\r\n    from pyspark.sql.types import StringType\r\n    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\n    def filename(path):\r\n        return path\r\n\r\n    session = SparkSession.builder.appName('APP').getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n    session.udf.register('sameText', filename)\r\n    sameText = udf(filename, StringType())\r\n\r\n    df = session.read.format('xml').load('a.xml', rowTag='root').select('*', input_file_name().alias('file'))\r\n    df.select('file').show() # works\r\n    df.select(sameText(df['file'])).show()   # returns empty content\r\n\r\nThe issue is because in `HadoopRDD` and `NewHadoopRDD` we set the file block's info in `InputFileBlockHolder` before the returned iterator begins consuming. `InputFileBlockHolder` will record this info into thread local variable. When running Python UDF in batch, we set up another thread to consume the iterator from child plan's output rdd, so we can't read the info back in another thread.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we have to set the info in `InputFileBlockHolder` after the iterator begins consuming.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt seems Hadoop libraries need winutils binaries for native libraries in the path.\r\n\r\nIt is not a problem in tests for now because we are only testing SparkR on Windows via AppVeyor but it can be a problem if we run Scala tests via AppVeyor as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n - SPARK-18220: read Hive orc table with varchar column *** FAILED *** (3

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEmpty partition column values are not valid for partition specification. Before this PR, we accept users to do it; however, Hive metastore does not detect and disallow it too. Thus, users hit the following strange error.\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(Seq((0, \"a\"), (1, \"b\"))).toDF(\"partCol1\", \"name\")\r\ndf.write.mode(\"overwrite\").partitionBy(\"partCol1\").saveAsTable(\"partitionedTable\")\r\nspark.sql(\"alter table partitionedTable drop partition(partCol1='')\")\r\nspark.table(\"partitionedTable\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the WHOLE table is DROPPED when users specify a partition spec containing only one partition column with empty values. \r\n\r\nWhen the partition columns contains more than one, Hive metastore APIs simply ignore the columns with empty values and treat it as partial spec. This is also not expected. This does not follow the actual Hive behaviors. This PR is to disallow users to specify such an invalid partition spec in the `SessionCatalog` APIs.   \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test

to Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4502)\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOne of the hallmarks of a column-oriented data storage format is the ability to read data from a subset of columns, efficiently skipping reads from other columns. Spark has long had support for pruning unneeded top-level schema fields from the scan of a parquet file. For example, consider a table, `contacts`, backed by parquet with the following Spark SQL schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- name: struct\r\n |    |-- first: string\r\n |    |-- last: string\r\n |-- address: string\r\n```\r\n\r\nParquet stores this table's data in three physical columns: `name.first`, `name.last` and `address`. To answer the query\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect address from contacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark will read only from the `address` column of parquet data. However, to answer the query\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect name.first from contacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark will read `name.first` and `name.last` from parquet.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies Spark SQL to support a finer-grain of schema pruning. With this patch, Spark reads only the `name.first` column to answer the previous query.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThere are three main components of this patch. First, there is a `ParquetSchemaPruning` optimizer rule for gathering the required schema fields of a `PhysicalOperation` over a parquet file, constructing a new schema based on those required fields and rewriting the plan in terms of that pruned schema. The pruned schema fields are pushed down to the parquet requested read schema. `ParquetSchemaPruning` uses a new `ProjectionOverSchema` extractor for rewriting a catalyst expression in terms of a pruned schema.\r\n\r\nSecond, the `ParquetRowConverter` has been patched to ensure the ordinals of the parquet columns read are correct for the pruned schema. `ParquetReadSupport` has been patched to address a compatibility mismatch between Spark's built in vectorized reader and the parquet-mr library's reader.\r\n\r\nThird, we introduce two new catalyst query transformations, `AggregateFieldExtractionPushdown` and `JoinFieldExtractionPushdown`, to support schema pruning in aggregation and join query plans. These rules extract field references in aggregations and joins respectively, push down aliases to those references and replace them with references to the pushed down aliases. They use a new `SelectedField` extractor that transforms a catalyst complex type extractor (the \"selected field\") into a corresponding `StructField`.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nThe performance difference in executing queries with this patch compared to master is related to the depth of the table schema and the query itself. At VideoAmp, one of our biggest tables stores OpenRTB bid requests we receive from our exchange partners. Our bid request table's schema closely follows the OpenRTB bid request object schema. Additionally, when we bid we save our response along with the request in the same table. We store these two objects as two top-level fields in our table. Therefore, all bid request and response data are contained within nested fields.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of measuring the performance impact of this patch, we ran some queries on our bid request table with the un-patched and patched master. We measured query execution time and the amount of data read from the underlying parquet files. I'll focus on a couple of benchmarks. (All benchmarks were run on an AWS EC2 cluster with four c3.8xl workers.) The first query I'll highlight is\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect count(request.device.ip) from event.bid_request where ds=20161128 and h=0\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Hopefully it's obvious what this query means.) On the un-patched master, this query ran in 2.7 minutes and read 34.3 GB of data. On the patched master, this query ran in 4 seconds and read 987.3 MB of data.\r\n\r\nWe also ran a reporting-oriented query benchmark. I won't reproduce the query here, but it reads a larger subset of the bid request fields and joins against another table with a deeply nested schema. In addition to a join, we perform several aggregations in this query. On the un-patched master, this query ran in 3.4 minutes and read 34.6 GB of data. On the patched master, this query ran in 59 seconds and read 2.6 GB of data.\r\n\r\n### Limitation\r\n\r\nAmong the complex Spark SQL data types, this patch supports parquet column pruning of nested sequences of struct fields only.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCare has been taken to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. This patch introduces over two dozen new unit tests and has been running on a production Spark 1.5 cluster at VideoAmp for about a year. In that time, one bug was found and fixed early on, and we added a regression test for that bug.\r\n\r\nWe forward-ported this patch to Spark master in June 2016 and have been running this patch against Spark 2.0 and 2.1 branches on ad-hoc clusters since

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently RDD.checkpoint must be called before any job executed on this RDD, otherwise the `doCheckpoint` will never be called. This is a pitfall and this Patch print warning message for such case.\r\nAnd, if RDD haven't been persisted, doing checkpoint will cause RDD recomputation, because current implementation will run separated job for checkpointing. In this case print RDD recomputation message, remind user to check whether he forgot persist the RDD.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual.\r\n\r\nTest case 1:\r\n```\r\nval rdd1 =  sc.makeRDD(Array(1,2,3),3).map(_ + 10)\r\nval rdd2 = rdd1.filter(...)\r\nval rdd3 = rdd2.map(...)\r\n\r\nrdd1.checkpoint() \r\nrdd3.count()\r\n\r\nrdd2.checkpoint()\r\nrdd3.count()\r\n // The latter `checkpoint` will not cause rdd2 to get checkpointed since the earlier checkpoint already marked `doCheckpointCalled = true`, this PR will printing some warning message for this case.\r\n```\r\nTest case 2:\r\n```\r\nval rdd = sc.makeRDD(Array(1,2,3),3).map(_ + 10)\r\nrdd.checkpoint() // because `rdd` do not persisted, so that checkpoint will cause this RDD recomputation, this patch will print recomputation message here.\r\nrdd.count() // trigger `doCheckpoint`\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest case 3:\r\n```\r\nval rdd = sc.makeRDD(Array(1,2,3),3).map(_ + 10)\r\nrdd.persist()\r\nrdd.checkpoint() // This is correct usage, won't print any warning in this patch.\r\nrdd.count() // trigger

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent CartesianRDD implementation, suppose RDDA cartisian RDDB, generating RDDC,\r\neach RDDA partition will be reading by multiple RDDC partition, and RDDB has similar problem.\r\nThis will cause, when RDDC partition computing, each partition's data in RDDA or RDDB will be repeatedly serialized (then transfer through network), if RDDA or RDDB haven't been persist, it will cause RDD recomputation repeatedly.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I change the dependency in `CartesianRDD` from `NarrowDependency` into `ShuffleDependency`, but still keep the way how the parent RDD partitioned. And computing CartesianRDD keep current implementation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a Cartesian

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr is to preserve aliases that are given for pivot aggregations to solve the issue reported in `SPARK-17237`. This pivoting adds backticks (e.g. 3_count(\\`c\\`)) in column names and, in some cases,\r\nthes causes analysis exceptions  like;\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = Seq((2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5)).toDF(\"a\",

Generate the `queryOutput` by:\r\n    1.1. If the query column names are defined, map the column names to attributes in the child output by name;\r\n    1.2. Else set the child output attributes to `queryOutput`.\r\n2. Map the `queryQutput` to view output by index, if the corresponding attributes don't match, try to up cast and alias the attribute in `queryOutput` to the attribute in the view output.\r\n3.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExpression Index returns the value of index n (right) of the array/map (left).\r\nTo be consistent with Hive, the left parameter should be of ArrayType or MapType, while the right parameter should be of AtomicType or NullType.\r\nExcept the rules above, Hive won't throw any exceptions, even if there's a type mismatch, it will output NULL to indicate not found. This implementation follows the rule.\r\n\r\nThere's one point this PR temporarily ignored, which is implicit cast for the right parameter, for example, in Hive:\r\n`> SELECT index(array(1, 2, 3), '2'); \r\n3\r\n`\r\nWhile in this implementation, it returns NULL. I will continue working on this.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest cases are also included in this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-12T08:39:53Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T05:34:27Z","closed_at":"2017-01-17T05:34:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f86297bc9800b380d20c1c7f95429b10367973a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16559/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16559/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16559/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f98dbb77734fcbd75c8138344ccc357a232ac9bc","head":{"label":"gcz2022:udfindex","ref":"udfindex","sha":"f98dbb77734fcbd75c8138344ccc357a232ac9bc","user":{"login":"gcz2022","id":7685352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODUzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7685352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022","html_url":"https://github.com/gcz2022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75595311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTU5NTMxMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gcz2022/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gcz2022","id":7685352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODUzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7685352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022","html_url":"https://github.com/gcz2022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcz2022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gcz2022/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn method tallSkinnyQR, the final Q is calculated by A * inv(R). When the upper triangular matrix R is ill-conditioned, computing the inverse of R can result in catastrophic cancellation. Instead, we should consider using a forward solve for solving Q such that Q * R = A.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit tests and the following codes in Spark Shell:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.{Matrices, Vector, Vectors}\r\nimport org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.RowMatrix\r\n\r\n// Create RowMatrix A.\r\nval mat = Seq(Vectors.dense(1,1,1,1), Vectors.dense(0, 1E-5, 1,1), Vectors.dense(0,0,1E-10,1), Vectors.dense(0,0,0,1E-14))\r\nval denseMat = new RowMatrix(sc.parallelize(mat, 2))\r\n\r\n// Apply tallSkinnyQR to A.\r\nval result = denseMat.tallSkinnyQR(true)\r\n\r\n// Print the calculated Q and R.\r\nresult.Q.rows.collect.foreach(println)\r\nresult.R\r\n\r\n// Calculate Q*R. Ideally, this should be close to A.\r\nval reconstruct = result.Q.multiply(result.R)\r\nreconstruct.rows.collect.foreach(println)\r\n\r\n// Calculate Q'*Q. Ideally, this should be close to the identity matrix.\r\nresult.Q.computeGramianMatrix()\r\n\r\nSystem.exit(0)\r\n```\r\nI first create a 4 by 4 RowMatrix A = (1,1,1,1;0,1E-5,0,0;0,0,1E-10,1;0,0,0,1E-14), and then I apply method tallSkinnyQR to A to find RowMatrix Q and Matrix R such that A = Q*R. In this case, A is ill-conditioned and so is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently in SQL we implement overwrites by calling fs.delete() directly on the original data. This is not ideal since we the original files end up deleted even if the job aborts.

Uncomment this for Java API\r\n// spark.udf.register(\"inc\", (i: Int) => i + 1)    // Uncomment this for Scala API\r\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"tmp\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT inc(y) FROM tmp GROUP BY inc(y)\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test in `JavaUDFSuite.java` and `./dev/lint-java`.","created_at":"2017-01-11T18:21:42Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:44:41Z","closed_at":"2017-01-24T06:22:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de80e8f9b6ba1df26f44992e7ae594e3b7cc70e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d5b5861f2480e93958343f12a05b02acd7ba12b","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-9435","ref":"SPARK-9435","sha":"0d5b5861f2480e93958343f12a05b02acd7ba12b","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we convert a string to integral, we will convert that string to `decimal(20, 0)` first, so that we can turn a string with decimal format to truncated integral, e.g. `CAST('1.2' AS int)` will return `1`.\r\n\r\nHowever, this brings problems when we convert a string with large numbers to integral, e.g. `CAST('1234567890123' AS int)` will return `1912276171`, while Hive returns null as we expected.\r\n\r\nThis is a long standing bug(seems it was there the first day Spark SQL was created), this PR fixes this bug by adding the native support to convert `UTF8String` to integral.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTwo problems are addressed in this patch.\r\n\r\n1. Serialize subclass of `Seq[_]` which doesn't have element type\r\n\r\nCurrently, in `ScalaReflection.serializerFor`, we try to serialize all sub types of `Seq[_]`. But for `Range` which is a `Seq[Int]` and doesn't have element type, `serializerFor` will fail and show mystery messages:\r\n\r\n    scala.MatchError: scala.collection.immutable.Range.Inclusive (of class scala.reflect.internal.Types$ClassNoArgsTypeRef)\r\n      at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection$.org$apache$spark$sql$catalyst$ScalaReflection$$serializerFor(ScalaReflection.scala:520)\r\n      at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection$.serializerFor(ScalaReflection.scala:463)\r\n      at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoder$.apply(ExpressionEncoder.scala:71) \r\n\r\nThis patch tries to fix this by considering the types without element type.\r\n\r\n2. Encoder can't deserialize internal row to required type\r\n\r\nWe serialize the objects with common super class such as `Seq[_]` to a common internal data. But when we want to deserialize the internal data back to the original objects, we will encounter the problem of initialization of different types of objects.\r\n\r\nFor example, we deserialize the data serialized from `Seq[_]` to `WrappedArray`. It works when we serialize data of `Seq[_]`. If we try to serialize data of subclass of `Seq[_]` (for example `Range`) which is not assignable from `WrappedArray`, there will be runtime error when converting deserialized data to the required subclass of `Seq[_]`.\r\n\r\nExcept for explicitly writing down the rule to deserialize each subclass of `Seq[_]`, I think the feasible solution is to check if we can convert deserialized data to the required type. This patch puts the check into `ExpressionEncoder.fromRow`. Once the requirement is not matched, we show a reasonable message to users.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReplaces `UserDefinedFunction` object returned from `udf` with a function wrapper providing docstring and arguments information as proposed in [SPARK-19161](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19161).\r\n\r\n### Backward incompatible changes:\r\n\r\n- `pyspark.sql.functions.udf` will return a `function` instead of `UserDefinedFunction`. To ensure backward compatible public API we use function attributes to mimic  `UserDefinedFunction` API (`func` and `returnType` attributes).  This should have a minimal impact on the user code.\r\n\r\n  An alternative implementation could use dynamical sub-classing. This would ensure full backward compatibility but is more fragile in practice.\r\n\r\n### Limitations:\r\n\r\nFull functionality (retained docstring and argument list) is achieved only in the recent Python version. Legacy Python version will preserve only docstrings, but not argument list. This should be an acceptable trade-off between achieved improvements and overall complexity.\r\n\r\n### Possible impact on other tickets:\r\n\r\nThis can affect [SPARK-18777](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18777).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests to ensure backward compatibility, additional tests targeting proposed changes.","created_at":"2017-01-10T21:22:29Z","updated_at":"2018-01-03T16:11:40Z","closed_at":"2017-02-24T16:25:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43b715457019664c78ddff33cdaaacc7e8d1e6ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/64bba41fe062dc39ad8708fa4dd825e609254814","head":{"label":"zero323:SPARK-19161","ref":"SPARK-19161","sha":"64bba41fe062dc39ad8708fa4dd825e609254814","user":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43824676,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzgyNDY3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"zero323/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zero323/spark","description":"Mirror

users to define UDF using simplified syntax:\r\n    \r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.decorators import udf\r\n    \r\n@udf(IntegerType())\r\ndef add_one(x):\r\n    \"\"\"Adds one\"\"\"\r\n    if x is not None:\r\n        return x + 1\r\n ```\r\n    \r\nwithout need to define a separate function and udf.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests to ensure backward compatibility and additional unit tests covering new functionality.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-10T20:56:26Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T10:59:17Z","closed_at":"2017-02-15T18:18:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ba96a0b910d988369fc1244b6d248e31820e2a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16533/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16533/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16533/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8f8d39e11e18eeff6096b196353d9a0427fd92e1","head":{"label":"zero323:SPARK-19160","ref":"SPARK-19160","sha":"8f8d39e11e18eeff6096b196353d9a0427fd92e1","user":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43824676,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzgyNDY3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"zero323/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zero323/spark","description":"Mirror

according to the `spark.sql.runSQLOnFiles` flag. If the flag is off when we create `SparkSession`, this rule is not added and we can not query files directly even we turn on the flag later.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this bug by always adding that rule to
