PR exposes the internal testing `MemorySink` though the data source API.  This will allow users to easily test streaming applications in the Spark shell or other local tests.\n\nUsage:\n\n``` scala\ninputStream.write\n  .format(\"memory\")\n  .queryName(\"memStream\")\n  .startStream()\n\n// Now you can query the result of the stream here.\nsqlContext.table(\"memStream\")\n```\n\nThe most complicated part of the logic is choosing the checkpoint directory.  There are a few requirements we are attempting to satisfy here:\n- when working in the shell locally, it should just work with no extra configuration.\n- when working on a cluster you should be able to make it easily create the checkpoint on a distributed file system so you can test aggregation (state checkpoints are also stored in this directory and must be accessible from workers).\n- it should be clear that you can't resume since the data is just in memory.\n\nThe chosen algorithm proceeds as follows:\n- the user gives a checkpoint directory, use it\n- if the conf has a checkpoint location, use `$location/$queryName`\n- if neither, create a local directory\n- always check to make sure there are no offsets written to the directory\n","created_at":"2016-04-01T23:04:55Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T08:42:24Z","closed_at":"2016-04-06T17:06:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6db370aa68d945df9986e16cddccfa750cf7d5c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12119/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12119/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12119/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/88cc2083a5ce401627619e98aca42ee142739c19","head":{"label":"marmbrus:memorySink","ref":"memorySink","sha":"88cc2083a5ce401627619e98aca42ee142739c19","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n**Main change**: Added save/load for RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor (implementation details below)\n\nModified numTrees method (_deprecation_)\n- Goal: Use default implementations of unit tests which assume Estimators and Models share the same set of Params.\n- What this PR does: Moves method numTrees outside of trait TreeEnsembleModel.  Adds it to GBT and RF Models.  Deprecates it in RF Models in favor of new method getNumTrees.  In Spark 2.1, we can have RF Models include Param numTrees.\n\nMinor items\n- Fixes bugs in GBTClassificationModel, GBTRegressionModel fromOld methods where they assign the wrong old UID.\n\n**Implementation details**\n- Split DecisionTreeModelReadWrite.loadTreeNodes into 2 methods in order to reuse some code for ensembles.\n- Added EnsembleModelReadWrite object with save/load implementations usable for RFs and GBTs\n  - These store all trees' nodes in a single DataFrame, and all trees' metadata in a second DataFrame.\n- Split trait RandomForestParams into parts in order to add more Estimator Params to RF models\n- Split DefaultParamsWriter.saveMetadata into two methods to allow ensembles to store sub-models' metadata in a single DataFrame.  Same for DefaultParamsReader.loadMetadata\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdds standard unit tests for RF

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR implements CreateFunction and DropFunction commands. Besides implementing these two commands, we also change how to manage functions. Here are the main changes.\n- `FunctionRegistry` will be a container to store all functions builders and it will not actively load any functions. Because of this change, we do not need to maintain a separate registry for HiveContext. So, `HiveFunctionRegistry` is deleted.\n- SessionCatalog takes care the job of loading a function if this function is not in the `FunctionRegistry` but its metadata is stored in the external catalog. For this case, SessionCatalog will (1) load the metadata from the external catalog, (2) load all needed resources (i.e. jars and files), (3) create a function builder based on the function definition, (4) register the function builder in the `FunctionRegistry`.\n- A `UnresolvedGenerator` is created. So, the parser will not need to call `FunctionRegistry` directly during parsing, which is not a good time to create a Hive UDTF. In the analysis phase, we will resolve `UnresolvedGenerator`.\n\nThis PR is based on @viirya's https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12036/ \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests and new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently Spark clients are started with the same memory setting for Xms and Xms leading to reserving unnecessary higher amounts of memory. \nThis behavior is changed and the clients can now specify an initial heap size using the extraJavaOptions in the config for driver,executor and am individually.\n Note, that only -Xms can be provided through this config option, if the client wants to set the max size(-Xmx), this has to be done via the *.memory configuration knobs which are currently supported.  \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nMonitored executor and yarn logs in debug mode to verify the commands through which they are being launched in client and cluster mode. The driver memory was verified locally using jps -v. Setting up -Xmx parameter in the javaExtraOptions raises exception with the info provided.\n","created_at":"2016-04-01T20:52:23Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T02:24:07Z","closed_at":"2016-04-07T15:41:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68136666065555977fb39ef16a7fd72469b84d18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12115/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12115/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12115/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b42ea78b87b45cdc876436cdd7bed4843d46218f","head":{"label":"dhruve:impr/SPARK-12384","ref":"impr/SPARK-12384","sha":"b42ea78b87b45cdc876436cdd7bed4843d46218f","user":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54914940,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDkxNDk0MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dhruve/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRDD.toLocalIterator() could be used to fetch one partition at a time to reduce the memory usage. Right now, for Dataset/Dataframe we have to use df.rdd.toLocalIterator, which is super slow also requires lots of memory (because of the Java serializer or even Kyro serializer).\n\nThis PR introduce an optimized toLocalIterator for Dataset/DataFrame, which is much faster and requires much less memory. For a partition with 5 millions rows, `df.rdd.toIterator` took about 100 seconds, but df.toIterator took less than 7 seconds. For 10 millions row, rdd.toIterator will crash (not enough memory) with 4G heap, but df.toLocalIterator could finished in 12 seconds.\n\nThe JDBC server has been updated to use DataFrame.toIterator.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-01T20:40:04Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T20:45:05Z","closed_at":"2016-04-04T20:33:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"351a45e2edb04e6641c0684134bd181daeb6f0fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/34b3f1ca02bbb0d7c3893c35c5b1d9b42d143d5f","head":{"label":"davies:local_iterator","ref":"local_iterator","sha":"34b3f1ca02bbb0d7c3893c35c5b1d9b42d143d5f","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

main issue we are trying to solve is the memory bloat of the Driver when tasks request the map output statuses.  This means with a large number of tasks you either need a huge amount of memory on Driver or you have to repartition to smaller number.  This makes it really difficult to run over say 50000 tasks.\n\nThe main issues that cause the memory bloat are:\n1) no flow control on sending the map output status responses.  We serialize the map status output  and then hand off to netty to send.  netty is sending asynchronously and it can't send them fast enough to keep up with incoming requests so we end up with lots of copies of the serialized map output statuses sitting there and this causes huge bloat when you have 10's of thousands of tasks and map output status is in the 10's of MB.\n2) When initial reduce tasks are started up, they all request the map output statuses from the Driver. These requests are handled by multiple threads in parallel so even though we check to see if we have a cached version, initially when we don't have a cached version yet, many of initial requests can all end up serializing the exact same map output statuses.\n\nThis patch does a couple of things:\n- When the map output status size is over a threshold (default 512K) then it uses broadcast to send the map statuses.  This means we no longer serialize a large map output status and thus we don't have issues with memory bloat.  the messages sizes are now in the 300-400 byte range and the map status output are broadcast. If its under the threadshold it sends it as before, the message contains the DIRECT indicator now.\n- synchronize the incoming requests to allow one thread to cache the serialized output and broadcast the map output status  that can then be used by everyone else.  This ensures we don't create multiple broadcast variables when we don't need to.  To ensure this happens I added a second thread pool which the Dispatcher hands the requests to so that those threads can block without blocking the main dispatcher threads (which would cause things like heartbeats and such not to come through)\n\nNote that some of design and code was contributed by @mridulm\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests and a lot of manually testing. \nRan with akka and netty rpc. Ran with both dynamic allocation on and off.\n\none of the large jobs I used to test this was a join of 15TB of data.  it had 200,000 map tasks, and  20,000 reduce tasks. Executors ranged from 200 to 2000.  This job ran successfully with 5GB of memory on the driver with these changes. Without these changes I was using 20GB and only had 500 reduce tasks.  The job has 50mb of serialized map output statuses and took roughly the same amount of time for the executors to get the map output statuses as before.\n\nRan a variety of other jobs, from large wordcounts to small ones not using broadcasts.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhile trying to create a PR (which was not an issue at the end), I just corrected some style nits.\n\nSo, I removed the changes except for some coding style corrections.\n- According to the [scala-style-guide#documentation-style](https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide#documentation-style), Scala style comments are discouraged.\n\n> ``` scala\n> /** This is a correct one-liner, short description. */\n> \n> /**\n>  * This is correct multi-line JavaDoc comment. And\n>  * this is my second line, and if I keep typing, this would be\n>  * my third line.\n>  */\n> \n> /** In Spark, we don't use the ScalaDoc style so this\n>   * is not correct.\n>   */\n> ```\n- Double newlines between consecutive methods was removed. According to [scala-style-guide#blank-lines-vertical-whitespace](https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide#blank-lines-vertical-whitespace), single newline appears when\n\n> Between consecutive members (or initializers) of a class: fields, constructors, methods, nested classes, static initializers, instance initializers.\n- Remove uesless parentheses in tests \n- Use `mapPartitions` instead of `mapPartitionsWithIndex()`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were used and `dev/run_tests` for style tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-01T10:06:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:54Z","closed_at":"2016-04-02T05:53:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb37687a20d1748dd160450fe2c9225967ae9af2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12109/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12109/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12109/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f56e748ed81711a98d70427b791a790f26da471d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-14271","ref":"SPARK-14271","sha":"f56e748ed81711a98d70427b791a790f26da471d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHere is the generated code snippet when executing date functions. SimpleDateFormat is fairly expensive and can show up bottleneck when processing millions of records. It would be better to instantiate it once.\n\n```\n/* 066 */     UTF8String primitive5 = null;\n/* 067 */     if (!isNull4) {\n/* 068 */       try {\n/* 069 */         primitive5 = UTF8String.fromString(new java.text.SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\").format(\n/* 070 */             new java.util.Date(primitive7 * 1000L)));\n/* 071 */       } catch (java.lang.Throwable e) {\n/* 072 */         isNull4 = true;\n/* 073 */       }\n/* 074 */     }\n```\n\nWith modified code, here is the generated code\n\n```\n/* 010 */   private java.text.SimpleDateFormat sdf2;\n/* 011 */   private UnsafeRow result13;\n/* 012 */   private org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.BufferHolder bufferHolder14;\n/* 013 */   private org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter rowWriter15;\n/* 014 */\n...\n...\n/* 065 */     boolean isNull0 = isNull3;\n/* 066 */     UTF8String primitive1 = null;\n/* 067 */     if (!isNull0) {\n/* 068 */       try {\n/* 069 */         if (sdf2 == null) {\n/* 070 */           sdf2 = new java.text.SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\n/* 071 */         }\n/* 072 */         primitive1 = UTF8String.fromString(sdf2.format(\n/* 073 */             new java.util.Date(primitive4 * 1000L)));\n/* 074 */       } catch (java.lang.Throwable e) {\n/* 075 */         isNull0 = true;\n/* 076 */       }\n/* 077 */     }\n```\n\nSimilarly Calendar.getInstance was used in DateTimeUtils which can be lazily inited.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DateExpressionsSuite,org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.DateTimeUtilsSuite\nAlso tried with couple of sample SQL queries with single executor (6GB) which showed good improvement with the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe syntax of \"SHOW FUNCTIONS\" can be found here:\n[https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-ShowFunctions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-ShowFunctions)\n\nBy leveraging catalog.listFunctions(), we can get the proper list of functions with proper regex. \n\nPlease check listFunctions() in SessionCatalog.scala to see how \"*\" get escaped. \n\nIf we do not escape \"*\", for pattern \"*f*\", it will cause exception (PatternSyntaxException, Dangling meta character) and thus return empty result.\n\nThe original approach is to replace \"*\" with \".*\" to make regex work, but it will fail on the following case:\nSuppose functions: sha, sha1, sha2; Query string \"sha.*\" (sha will not be shown because query becomes \"sha..*\" - notice 2 dots) \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI have added test cases for this issue and also verified that it has the consistent result from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR did a few cleanup on HashedRelation and HashJoin:\n\n1) Merge HashedRelation and UniqueHashedRelation together\n2) Return an iterator from HashedRelation, so we donot need a create many UnsafeRow objects.\n3) Return a copy of HashedRelation for thread-safety in BroadcastJoin, so we can re-use the UnafeRow objects.\n4) Cleanup HashJoin, share most of the code between BroadcastHashJoin and ShuffleHashJoin\n5) Removed UniqueLongHashedRelation, which will be replaced by LongUnsafeMap (another PR).\n6) Update benchmark, before this patch, the selectivity of joins are too high.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDecision tree helper classes will be migrated to ML. This patch moves those internal classes that are not part of the public API and removes ones that are no longer used, after [SPARK-12183](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11855). No functional changes are made.\n\nDetails:\n- Bin.scala is removed as the ML implementation does not require bins\n- mllib NodeIdCache is removed. It was only used by the mllib implementation previously, which no longer exists\n- mllib TreePoint is removed. It was only used by the mllib implementation previously, which no longer exists\n- BaggedPoint, DTStatsAggregator, DecisionTreeMetadata, BaggedPointSuite and TimeTracker are all moved to ML. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo functional changes are made. Existing unit tests ensure behavior is unchanged.\n","created_at":"2016-03-31T21:16:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-02T04:25:36Z","closed_at":"2016-04-02T04:25:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b996f15c270e3501839e644c10ad8678ee0ed5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12097/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12097/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12097/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7ec154326d8f82f350464f571b1b5dd3798b2b67","head":{"label":"sethah:cleanup_mllib_tree","ref":"cleanup_mllib_tree","sha":"7ec154326d8f82f350464f571b1b5dd3798b2b67","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR implements `FileFormat.buildReader()` for the LibSVM data source. Besides that, a new interface method `prepareRead()` is added to `FileFormat`:\n\n``` scala\n  def prepareRead(\n      sqlContext: SQLContext,\n      options: Map[String, String],\n      files: Seq[FileStatus]): Map[String, String] = options\n```\n\nAfter migrating from `buildInternalScan()` to `buildReader()`, we lost the opportunity to collect necessary global information, since `buildReader()` works in a per-partition manner. For example, LibSVM needs to infer the total number of features if the `numFeatures` data source option is not set. Any necessary collected global information should be returned using the data source options map. By default, this method just returns the original options untouched.\n\nAn alternative approach is to absorb `inferSchema()` into `prepareRead()`, since schema inference is also some kind of global information gathering. However, this approach wasn't chosen because schema inference is optional, while `prepareRead()` must be called whenever a `HadoopFsRelation` based data source relation is instantiated.\n\nOne unaddressed problem is that, when `numFeatures` is absent, now the input data will be scanned twice. The `buildInternalScan()` code path doesn't need to do this because it caches the raw parsed RDD in memory before computing the total number of features. However, with `FileScanRDD`, the raw parsed RDD is created in a different way (e.g. partitioning) from the final RDD.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested using existing test suites.\n","created_at":"2016-03-31T14:41:51Z","updated_at":"2016-06-15T23:16:23Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T06:47:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ac492327de06ae34f1c10eae25fad6cd1efc4b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12088/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12088/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12088/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/931a29fe0c128e5b2708f8280150e98aa9d7b9e6","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-14295-libsvm-build-reader","ref":"spark-14295-libsvm-build-reader","sha":"931a29fe0c128e5b2708f8280150e98aa9d7b9e6","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n Based on the map output sizes and locations tracked by MapOutputTracker, we can obtain a better load balancing\n\nThis patch proposes a strategy to set preferred locations for each reduce task, which could firstly keep each executor process almost the same amount of intermediate data and secondly minimize the network data transmission. This can benefit some conditions:\n\n1．REDUCER_PREF_LOCS_FRACTION tries to place the reduce tasks close to the largest output. If there exists data skew in the map outputs. It could cause some executors that have large of map outputs become busy. Our method could avoid this case and minimize the network data transmission.\n\n2．When there are large of reduce tasks in the job, it helps each executor processes almost the same data and keeps load balancing.\n\nThe special steps are following.\nStep 1: For each task, calculate the amount of data and their distributions.\n\nStep 2: Divide the tasks into n groups according to the number of nodes and data size, ensuring that the data size for each group is nearly equal.\n\nStep 3: Determine the amount of local data if the tasks of every group are executed on every node. Thus, a n × n matrix is created.\n\nStep 4: Choose the largest value in the matrix to identify which group is allocated to which node. Mark the row and column at which the selected group is located to ensure that the group is not chosen next time. Goto Step 4 until no group is available.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test suite\nAuthor: Cheng Pei

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen netty transfer data that is not `FileRegion`, data will be in format of `ByteBuf`, If the data is large, there will occur significant performance issue because there is memory copy underlying in `sun.nio.ch.IOUtil.write`, the CPU is 100% used, and network is very low.\n\nIn this PR, if data size is large, we will split it into small chunks to call `WritableByteChannel.write()`, so that avoid wasting of memory copy. Because the data can't be written within a single write, and it will call `transferTo` multiple times. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nSpark unit test and manual test.\nManual test:\n`sc.parallelize(Array(1,2,3),3).mapPartitions(a=>Array(new Array[Double](1024 * 1024 * 50)).iterator).reduce((a,b)=> a).length`\n\nFor more details, please refer to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFirst, a few test cases failed in mac OS X  because the property value of `java.io.tmpdir` does not include a trailing slash on some platform. Hive always removes the last trailing slash. For example, what I got in the web:\n\n```\nWin NT  --> C:\\TEMP\\\nWin XP  --> C:\\TEMP\nSolaris --> /var/tmp/\nLinux   --> /var/tmp\n```\n\nSecond, a couple of test cases are added to verify if the commands work properly.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case for it and correct the previous test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-03-31T06:58:53Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T21:36:20Z","closed_at":"2016-05-05T21:36:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fe92e59c4171365858ceecdca3b60b11c6cc68a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b190b86d36445056b0d15e903498e765cf1555a9","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:mkdir","ref":"mkdir","sha":"b190b86d36445056b0d15e903498e765cf1555a9","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

the addition of StreamExecution (ContinuousQuery) to Datasets, data will become unbounded. With unbounded data, the execution of some methods and operations will not make sense, e.g. `Dataset.count()`.\n\nA simple API is required to check whether the data in a Dataset is bounded or unbounded. This will allow users to check whether their Dataset is in streaming mode or not. ML algorithms may check if the data is unbounded and throw an exception for example.\n\nThe implementation of this method is simple, however naming it is the challenge. Some possible names for this method are:\n- isStreaming\n- isContinuous\n- isBounded\n- isUnbounded\n\nI've gone with `isStreaming` for now. We can change it before Spark 2.0 if we decide to come up with a different name. For that reason I've marked it as `@Experimental`\n","created_at":"2016-03-31T04:09:47Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:59:05Z","closed_at":"2016-04-05T02:05:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21602f9d09d02f6b84b7165f9cb08c7907cf3020","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4debd0defd4982a901fd47ac4f4cd7b90fb886d","head":{"label":"brkyvz:is-streaming","ref":"is-streaming","sha":"f4debd0defd4982a901fd47ac4f4cd7b90fb886d","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the Dataset API, it is fairly difficult for users to perform simple aggregations in a type-safe way at the moment because there are no aggregators that have been implemented. This pull request adds a few common aggregate functions in expressions.scala.typed package, and also creates the expressions.java.typed package without implementation. The java implementation should probably come as a separate pull request. One challenge there is to resolve the type difference between Scala primitive types and Java boxed types.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests for them.\n","created_at":"2016-03-31T01:59:28Z","updated_at":"2016-04-03T00:47:48Z","closed_at":"2016-04-02T05:48:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"49dcc89f2713544454dc5ef904ad9ccc1bc47a49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12077/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12077/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12077/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cec6902fc6bb5b501aa5b1c536b034508f7a5c75","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14285","ref":"SPARK-14285","sha":"cec6902fc6bb5b501aa5b1c536b034508f7a5c75","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

tested.\n","created_at":"2016-03-30T22:11:13Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T19:59:34Z","closed_at":"2016-05-09T19:59:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92e069c52cdc8d1ed97bab10438ca5dcc3b390fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12075/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12075/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12075/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b8da260ec70518867c34c834be399fe412622975","head":{"label":"zhuoliu:13064","ref":"13064","sha":"b8da260ec70518867c34c834be399fe412622975","user":{"login":"zhuoliu","id":11683054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjgzMDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11683054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuoliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40550299,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDU1MDI5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhuoliu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhuoliu","id":11683054,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjgzMDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11683054?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuoliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuoliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhuoliu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR improves `CodeFormatter` to fix the following malformed indentations.\n\n``` java\n/* 019 */   public java.lang.Object apply(java.lang.Object _i) {\n/* 020 */     InternalRow i = (InternalRow) _i;\n/* 021 */     /* createexternalrow(if (isnull(input[0, double])) null else input[0, double], if (isnull(input[1, int])) null else input[1, int], ... */\n/* 022 */       boolean isNull = false;\n/* 023 */       final Object[] values = new Object[2];\n/* 024 */       /* if (isnull(input[0, double])) null else input[0, double] */\n/* 025 */     /* isnull(input[0, double]) */\n...\n/* 053 */     if (!false && false) {\n/* 054 */       /* null */\n/* 055 */     final int value9 = -1;\n/* 056 */     isNull6 = true;\n/*

following.\n\n``` java\n/* 019 */   public java.lang.Object apply(java.lang.Object _i) {\n/* 020 */     InternalRow i = (InternalRow) _i;\n/* 021 */     /* createexternalrow(if (isnull(input[0,

    /* if (isnull(input[0, double])) null else input[0, double] */\n/* 025 */     /* isnull(input[0, double]) */\n...\n/* 053 */     if (!false && false) {\n/* 054 */       /* null */\n/* 055 */

\n```\n\nAlso, this issue fixes the following too. (Similar with [SPARK-14185](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14185))\n\n``` java\n16/03/30 12:39:24 DEBUG WholeStageCodegen: /* 001 */ public Object generate(Object[] references) {\n/* 002

new GeneratedIterator(references);\n/* 003 */ }\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins tests (including new CodeFormatterSuite testcases.)\n","created_at":"2016-03-30T21:12:13Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T00:57:27Z","closed_at":"2016-03-30T23:17:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2897d610f87b0587620f2f041235e7080778ddf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12072/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12072/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12072/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/904197e82b93caa9653f9352d7d23cd0460edcdb","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-14282","ref":"SPARK-14282","sha":"904197e82b93caa9653f9352d7d23cd0460edcdb","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"bdabfd43f6e4900b48010dd00ffa48ed5fd15997","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`ExpressionEncoder` is just a container for serialization and deserialization expressions, we can use these expressions to build `TypedAggregateExpression` directly, so that it can fit in `DeclarativeAggregate`, which is more efficient.\n\nOne trick is, for each buffer serializer expression, it will reference to the result object of serialization and function call. To avoid re-calculating this result object, we can serialize the buffer object to a single struct field, so that we can use a special `Expression` to only evaluate result object once.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests\n","created_at":"2016-03-30T16:46:32Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T04:11:50Z","closed_at":"2016-04-15T04:11:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fa05f9ac180bd10db33d1e82108d9d3c6b1ca09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4ee5ac178bfb14eb54d4a669deebac1df86425a8","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:typed_udaf","ref":"typed_udaf","sha":"4ee5ac178bfb14eb54d4a669deebac1df86425a8","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe implement typed filter by `MapPartitions`, which doesn't work well with whole stage codegen. This PR use `Filter` to implement typed filter and we can get the whole stage codegen support for free.\n\nThis PR also introduced `DeserializeToObject` and `SerializeFromObject`, to seperate serialization logic from object operator, so that it's eaiser to write optimization rules for adjacent object operators.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently a method `submitStage()` for waiting stages is called on every iteration of the event loop in `DAGScheduler` to submit all waiting stages, but most of them are not necessary because they are not related to Stage status.\nThe case we should try to submit waiting stages is only when their parent stages are successfully completed.\n\nThis elimination can improve `DAGScheduler` performance.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded some checks and other existing tests, and our projects.\n\nWe have a project bottle-necked by `DAGScheduler`, having about 2000 stages.\n\nBefore this patch the almost all execution time in `Driver` process was spent to process `submitStage()` of `dag-scheduler-event-loop` thread but after this patch the performance was improved as follows:\n\n|  | total execution time | `dag-scheduler-event-loop` thread time | `submitStage()` |\n| --- | --: | --: | --: |\n| Before | 760 sec | 710 sec | 667 sec |\n| After | 440 sec | 14 sec | 10 sec

For 3 UDFs, it launched 12 Python before before this patch, 4 process after this patch. After this patch, it will use less memory for multiple UDFs than before (less buffering).\n","created_at":"2016-03-30T08:17:05Z","updated_at":"2016-03-31T23:42:20Z","closed_at":"2016-03-31T23:42:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f521fbbbd5cfca128375db9a31bf4a820342815c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12057/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12057/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12057/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/876f9f9b8240b531280d9e9834e60d00900b42fa","head":{"label":"davies:multi_udfs","ref":"multi_udfs","sha":"876f9f9b8240b531280d9e9834e60d00900b42fa","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR proposes a new data-structure based on a vectorized hashmap that can be potentially _codegened_ in `TungstenAggregate` to speed up aggregates with group by. Micro-benchmarks show a 10x improvement over the current `BytesToBytes` aggregation map.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n```\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-4960HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz\nBytesToBytesMap:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch removes the implementation of gradient boosted trees in mllib/tree/GradientBoostedTrees.scala and changes mllib GBTs to call the implementation in spark.ML. \n\nPrimary changes:\n- Removed `boost` method in mllib GradientBoostedTrees.scala\n- Created new test suite GradientBoostedTreesSuite in ML, which contains unit tests that were specific to GBT internals from mllib\n\nOther changes:\n- Added an `updatePrediction` method in GradientBoostedTrees package. This method is added to provide consistency for methods that build predictions from boosted models. There are several methods that hard code the method of predicting as: sum_{i=1}^{numTrees} (treePrediction*treeWeight). Calling this function ensures that test methods that check accuracy use the same prediction method that the algorithm uses during training\n- Added methods that were previously only used in testing, but were public methods, to GradientBoostedTrees. This includes `computeError` (previously part  of `Loss` trait) and `evaluateEachIteration`. These are used in the new spark.ML unit tests. They are left in mllib as well so as to not break the API.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests which compare ML and MLlib ensure that mllib GBTs have not changed. Only a single unit test was moved to ML, which verifies that `runWithValidation` performs as expected.

PR adds the ability to perform aggregations inside of a `ContinuousQuery`.  In order to implement this feature, the planning of aggregation has augmented with a new `StatefulAggregationStrategy`.  Unlike batch aggregation, stateful-aggregation uses the `StateStore` (introduced in #11645) to persist the results of partial aggregation across different invocations.  The resulting physical plan performs the aggregation using the following progression:\n- Partial Aggregation\n- Shuffle\n- Partial Merge (now there is at most 1 tuple per group)\n- StateStoreRestore (now there is 1 tuple from this batch + optionally one from the previous)\n- Partial Merge (now there is at most 1 tuple per group)\n- StateStoreSave (saves the tuple for the next batch)\n- Complete (output the current result of the aggregation)\n\nThe following refactoring was also performed to allow us to plug into existing code:\n- The get/put implementation is taken from #12013\n- The logic for breaking down and de-duping the physical execution of aggregation has been move into a new pattern `PhysicalAggregation`\n- The `AttributeReference` used to identify the result of an `AggregateFunction` as been moved into the `AggregateExpression` container.  This change moves the reference into the same object as the other intermediate references used in aggregation and eliminates the need to pass around a `Map[(AggregateFunction, Boolean), Attribute]`.  Further clean up (using a different aggregation container for logical/physical plans) is deferred to a followup.\n- Some planning logic is moved from the `SessionState` into the `QueryExecution` to make it easier to override in the streaming case.\n- The ability to write a `StreamTest` that checks only the output of the last batch has been added to simulate the future addition of output

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt looks like the docs were recently updated to reflect the History Server's support for incomplete applications, but they still had wording that

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`SizeBasedWindowFunction.n` is a global singleton attribute created for evaluating size based aggregate window functions like `CUME_DIST`. However, this attribute gets different expression IDs when created on both driver side and executor side. This PR adds `withPartitionSize` method to `SizeBasedWindowFunction` so that we can easily rewrite `SizeBasedWindowFunction.n` on executor side.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA test case is added in `HiveSparkSubmitSuite`, which supports launching multi-process clusters.\n","created_at":"2016-03-29T16:55:00Z","updated_at":"2016-04-02T05:02:05Z","closed_at":"2016-04-02T05:02:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6d63a7a59eef05b5c42ab485bd180358d258459","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27c22f23836cade81ce7e21eb9137630da7efb6d","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-14244-fix-sized-window-function","ref":"spark-14244-fix-sized-window-function","sha":"27c22f23836cade81ce7e21eb9137630da7efb6d","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn this patch, we set the initial `maxNumComponents` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` instead of the default size ( which is 16) when allocating `compositeBuffer` in `TransportFrameDecoder` because `compositeBuffer` will introduce too many memory copies underlying if `compositeBuffer` is with default `maxNumComponents` when the frame size is large (which result in many transport messages). For details, please refer to [SPARK-14242](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14242).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nspark unit tests and manual tests.\nFor manual tests, we can reproduce the performance issue with following code:\n`sc.parallelize(Array(1,2,3),3).mapPartitions(a=>Array(new Array[Double](1024 * 1024 * 50)).iterator).reduce((a,b)=> a).length`\nIt's easy to see the performance gain, both from the running time and CPU

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14123\n\nThis PR adds the support of native DDL commands to create and drop (temporary) functions.\n\nFor temporary function, these DDL commands call `FunctionRegistry` related APIs. This PR modifies current `FunctionRegistry` and `HiveFunctionRegistry` APIs to have proper temporary function support.\n\nFor permanent function, we will look up the function through catalog API and get `CatalogFunction` if the function exists. Then we will load necessary resources such as JARs, Files. Once the resources are loaded, we can create `FunctionBuilder` for it and generate an `Expression`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-29T12:33:31Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:33:21Z","closed_at":"2016-04-05T01:11:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"063bc43f8ad016c0dd7ea896cd04432d86a5da22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/05709f09cfa5fb171e926c839929135b1cda112e","head":{"label":"viirya:native-ddl-function","ref":"native-ddl-function","sha":"05709f09cfa5fb171e926c839929135b1cda112e","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently the Streaming tab in web UI uses records and events interchangeably; this PR tries to standardize them on \"records\".\n\n\"records\" is chosen over \"events\" because:\n- \"records\" is used extensively throughout the streaming documents, codes, and comments\n- \"events\" is used only in Streaming UI related codes and comments\n## How was this patch tested?\n- existing test suites\n- manually checking on the Streaming UI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14231\n\nCurrently, JSON data source supports to infer `DecimalType` for big numbers and `floatAsBigDecimal` option which reads floating-point values as `DecimalType`.\n\nBut there are few restrictions in Spark `DecimalType` below:\n1. The precision cannot be bigger than 38.\n2. scale cannot be bigger than precision. \n\nCurrently, both restrictions are not being handled.\n\nThis PR handles the cases by inferring them as `DoubleType`. Also, the option name was changed from `floatAsBigDecimal` to `prefersDecimal` as suggested [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14231?focusedCommentId=15215579&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15215579).\n\nSo, the codes below:\n\n``` scala\ndef doubleRecords: RDD[String] =\n  sqlContext.sparkContext.parallelize(\n    s\"\"\"{\"a\": 1${\"0\" * 38}, \"b\": 0.01}\"\"\" ::\n    s\"\"\"{\"a\": 2${\"0\" * 38}, \"b\": 0.02}\"\"\" :: Nil)\n\nval jsonDF = sqlContext.read\n  .option(\"prefersDecimal\", \"true\")\n  .json(doubleRecords)\njsonDF.printSchema()\n```\n\nproduces below:\n- **Before**\n\n``` scala\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Decimal scale (2) cannot be greater than precision (1).;\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.types.DecimalType.<init>(DecimalType.scala:44)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.json.InferSchema$.org$apache$spark$sql$execution$datasources$json$InferSchema$$inferField(InferSchema.scala:144)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.json.InferSchema$.org$apache$spark$sql$execution$datasources$json$InferSchema$$inferField(InferSchema.scala:108)\n    at \n...\n```\n- **After**\n\n``` scala\nroot\n |-- a: double (nullable = true)\n |-- b: double (nullable = true)\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were used and `./dev/run_tests` for coding style tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-29T08:24:22Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:52Z","closed_at":"2016-04-03T06:13:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"365a3ba8542bdd39cb45c739435b1f82d147a6cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/603c2c08426bc69b04aa1bfd0959a07ccb880839","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-14231","ref":"SPARK-14231","sha":"603c2c08426bc69b04aa1bfd0959a07ccb880839","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, RecurringTimer will normalize the start time. For instance, if batch duration is 1 min, all the job will start exactly at 1 min boundary.\nThis actually adds some burden to the streaming source. Assuming the source is Kafka, and there is a list of streaming jobs with 1 min batch duration, then at first few seconds of each min, high network traffic will be observed in Kafka. This makes Kafka capacity planning tricky.\nIt will be great to have an option in the streaming context to set the job start time. In this way, user can add a jitter for the start time for each, and make Kafka fetch_request much smooth across the duration window.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test: A test case added.\nIntegration test.\n","created_at":"2016-03-29T04:34:20Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T10:12:40Z","closed_at":"2016-10-31T10:12:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"072343f3fcc9f410c4c6cba0f1bab1baca722771","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12026/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12026/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12026/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3226a6044281b8d7ab53bf0e06cd9873f590a07a","head":{"label":"liyintang:SPARK-14230","ref":"SPARK-14230","sha":"3226a6044281b8d7ab53bf0e06cd9873f590a07a","user":{"login":"liyintang","id":2214342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTQzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2214342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang","html_url":"https://github.com/liyintang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54594153,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDU5NDE1Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"liyintang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liyintang","id":2214342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTQzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2214342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang","html_url":"https://github.com/liyintang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyintang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liyintang/spark","description":"Mirror
