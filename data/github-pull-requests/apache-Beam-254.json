sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThe signal from Travis CI is so degraded we should delete it rather than keep it as-is. This is one attempt to salvage it.\n\nMy overall thought is that we should simplify its responsibilities until it is not flaky. And that basically implies that it will simply do less, which means it can be used to try to give very rapid feedback, while Jenkins does the more intense stuff.\n\nSo this PR just proposes removing the flaky and slow integration test. Technically, we lose the matrix of JDKs. In practice, we already ignore them and combine the matrix with \"OR\" instead of \"AND\".\n\nR: @dhalperi \nCC:

A binder/evaluator a la `StateBinder` (this is the super-type-safe way of doing data in Java) but that adds a non-user-facing method to the interface. It can be useful sometimes, such as the way that `StateTag` has a phantom type that gets propagated to the return type of the visitor.\n2. A visitor a la `PipelineVisitor` that just mutates some internal state. This is roughly the same as the prior, but returning `void` and mutating makes it easier to return complex data but forces an ordering.\n3. Using reflection to treat the Java class as the disjoint union tag. This is the approach taken by Scala, and the approach I take here. I tried to minimize the reflective boilerplate this induced. No type safety is really lost, since in the technical vision, this trigger will be an AST sent over the wire (aka no type safety is available).\n\nR: @bjchambers
