This matches the existing behavior of references to .js files included with .swc libraries.</li>\n<li>(JS) Static getters/setters are not accessed with [&quot;name&quot;] syntax in generated JavaScript anymore, which required them to always be exported, even if the associated export symbols compiler option were disabled.</li>\n<li>(JS) When internal namespace is used in ActionScript, the generated JavaScript adds the <a href=\"https://github.com/package\"><code>@​package</code></a> annotation.</li>\n<li>(JS) Fixed issue where the Language class was not loaded in the correct order when type coersion is required in a static initializer.</li>\n<li>(JS) (Advanced) Added export-internal-symbols and prevent-rename-internal-symbols compiler options to match the existing options for public and protected namespaces.</li>\n<li>(JS) (Advanced) Added prevent-rename-public-static-methods, prevent-rename-public-instance-methods, prevent-rename-public-static-variables, prevent-rename-public-instance-variables, prevent-rename-public-static-accessors, and prevent-rename-public-instance-accessors compiler options to provide more granular control when prevent-rename-public-symbols is true (same for protected and internal namespaces too).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/ba09ed9ed40f646124a98792fe05afc5b827520e\"><code>ba09ed9</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release org.apache.royale.compiler-0.9.8-rc7</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/b2c5e089784abadc04f8893c8f5a022f1a75f0a5\"><code>b2c5e08</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare branch @{releaseLabel}</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/797163e63b2e5e76fb19ff419c0b8d11979f0f4d\"><code>797163e</code></a> Merge branch 'develop' of <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler\">https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler</a> into develop</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/95fbea5c205a5b36c9273fee97d38e469e5cd521\"><code>95fbea5</code></a> Revert &quot;[maven-release-plugin] prepare branch @{releaseLabel}&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/f318d20f7a261fdeee1e7bfb2f405a117b7a3d68\"><code>f318d20</code></a> Revert &quot;[MAVEN-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/bf2047ca0c52a68363ed89f2171ea22bc8889cbe\"><code>bf2047c</code></a> make sure we include compiler release notes in staging</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/744a76bc15a52e7348d5fba524536d3fbc485bba\"><code>744a76b</code></a> minor change to release notes for 0.9.8</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/b35629b42242e0b1eff7da26960bef6e7d614cd1\"><code>b35629b</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/dd126f1f77a579b78b04b965983770ce6282f89a\"><code>dd126f1</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare branch @{releaseLabel}</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/commit/19e4e18c8c5148a0dd195c3e776f9949070d4d94\"><code>19e4e18</code></a> Revert &quot;[maven-release-plugin] prepare branch @{releaseLabel}&quot;</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/royale-compiler/compare/apache-royale-0.9.7...apache-royale-0.9.8\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/releases\">gmavenplus-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.12.1</h2>\n<h2>Bugs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/186\">#186</a> Certain AST transformations had classloader issues because 1.12.0 was no longer setting the context classloader.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update Jansi to 2.x.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Potentially breaking changes</h2>\n<p>The Jansi upgrade should generally be compatible, but could cause issues with scripts that were using Jansi 1.x specific classes.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>None.</p>\n<h2>1.12.0</h2>\n<h2>Bugs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/183\">#183</a> The classloader project dependencies are loaded onto is reused between modules, so each module was a superset of all modules that preceded it. Also, the console, execute, and shell mojos didn't pass the classloader to use into the instantiated GroovyConsole/GroovyShell, so it accidentally was using the plugin classloader, even when configured to use <code>PROJECT_ONLY</code> classpath.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2>Potentially breaking changes</h2>\n<p>This should be a non-breaking change (except for unusual situations that were relying on the previous incorrect behavior).  However, since it's a significant change, I'm bumping the version by more than just the patch version.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>This potentially runs slower than before, since a new classloader is instantiated each execution, rather than resuing the same classloader, so the classes referenced will have to be reinitialized.</p>\n<h2>1.11.1</h2>\n<h2>Bugs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes IllegalArgumentException when <code>consoleScript</code> parameter was loaded from POM rather than command line property.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2>Potentially breaking changes</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2>1.11.0</h2>\n<h2>Bugs</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Change JDK compatibility check to also account for Java 16.</li>\n<li>Some tweaks for Groovy 4 (most notably, invokedynamic is enabled by default for Groovy 4 and cannot be disabled).</li>\n<li>New parameter (<code>attachGroovyDocAnnotation</code>) to enable attaching GroovyDoc annotation.</li>\n<li>New parameter (<code>parallelParsing</code>) to enable parallel parsing (enabled by default with Groovy 4).</li>\n<li>Remove <code>previewFeatures</code> parameter from stub generation goals, since it's not used there.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

be used in conjunction with the build-tools feature/opcua_native_client branch.\r\n\r\n- Implemented integration tests for the Java, Go and C build-util modules. \r\n    - This takes the test.mspec in the protocol-test module and generates code for each language\r\n    - It then tries to compile these sources. (Ideally it would be good implement tests for the parsing/serializing but should probably wait for the test.mspec to be improved upon beforehand)\r\n\r\n- Implemented Enumerated Discriminators in mspec, e.g. `[discriminator EnumType 'discr']`\r\n    - This avoids us working around it by not assigning the discriminator as a simple field and having to parse ti as a parameter when creating objects.\r\n\r\n- An accidental but slight improvement was added when defining Enumerated constants and switch fieds, you no longer have to include the Enumerated Type for each case e.g.\r\n```\r\n    [typeSwitch 'discr'\r\n        ['EnumType.BOOL'  DiscriminatedBOOL]\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```\r\n    [typeSwitch 'discr'\r\n        ['BOOL'  DiscriminatedBOOL]\r\n```\r\n- Implemented variable lengths for string fields e.g.\r\n    `[simple string '8' 'UTF-8' 'stringField']`\r\n    expressions can also be used\r\n    `[simple int 8 'stringLength']`\r\n    `[simple string 'stringLength' 'UTF-8' 'stringField']` // Have to update the templates when using implicit fields for stringLengths Ill do that tomorrow.\r\n\r\n- Added exclusions for RAT checks in C so that maven can be used to compile it.\r\n\r\n- Added the Go and C build-util modules to their respective profiles, with-go and with-c so we don't build them when only using java.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-18T11:19:09Z","updated_at":"2021-05-11T10:00:36Z","closed_at":"2021-03-31T08:15:11Z","merged_at":"2021-03-31T08:15:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"003c50ba4f7eb31c1402e2c55b86c8895bb6f713","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/statuses/1c311a0a41c570f9b1c75a916fb624966c3837e3","head":{"label":"apache:feature/string_enum_mspec","ref":"feature/string_enum_mspec","sha":"1c311a0a41c570f9b1c75a916fb624966c3837e3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114859883,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4NTk4ODM=","name":"plc4x","full_name":"apache/plc4x","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x","description":"PLC4X

now working when passed connection string with port eg. `s7:tcp://0.0.0.0:102` I don't think it possible that it was working before... ?\r\n\r\n`spi/src/system.c`: plugged mem leaks, removed unneeded mallocs (ie. mallocs in both `spi/src/system.c` and `spi/src/connection.c`, needed only in 1 of these locations), fixed compiler warnings on `hurz` cast and de-globalized `hurz` (maybe globalness was intended?). Rewrote the connection string parser to use tokenisation rather than walking pointer, which is IMO much clearer.\r\n\r\n`hello_world_s7.c` beautified some `printf`s and allowed optional cli arguments for setting the test connection string. \r\n\r\n`transport_tcp.c` fixed compile warning on `printf` without const format specifier.
