test generated serialized data text file is now correctly placed in the build dir when running from IntelliJ (using default settings) and gradlew. Previously, when running an implementation of AnalyzeSerializablesJUnitTestBase using IntelliJ, generated test files would be placed under geode/\\<geode module\\>/src. The current fix will place those same files in geode/out/production/\\<module's fully qualified class name\\>.integratedTest when run from IntelliJ.\r\n\r\nImproved the logic used by error message to build directory paths for sanctioned data file. This message is triggered when detecting a diff between test-generated serialized data and sanctioned data. A regular expression is used to address both IntelliJ and gradlew output error messages.\r\n\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is an alternative solution to the one explored in https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5269. This PR introduces a new interface `VersionOrdinal` to model not just versions we know about (as `Version` does) but also future versions. Formerly Geode modeled these as `short` but that presented difficulties in the many places where we need to compare versions. By unifying known and unknown versions under one interface, capable of providing generic comparison (`compareTo()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()`) my hope is that we can eliminate this egregious loss of information (in that other PR's `Version` implementation):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Version getVersion() {\r\n    try {\r\n      return Version.fromOrdinal(versionOrdinal);\r\n    } catch (final UnsupportedSerializationVersionException e) {\r\n      return Version.CURRENT;\r\n    } \r\n```\r\n\r\nThat code right there is essentially a mirror-image of the `GMSMemberData.setVersionObject()` method which is the original culprit in [GEODE-8240](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-8240). Rather than moving the wrongness from the eager/set side to the lazy/get side, this PR seeks to eliminate the wrongness entirely.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\nIntroduced new `VersionOrdinal` type (interface). It carries all the equality, comparison, hash code functionality formerly down in `Version`. Made a `VersionOrdinalImpl` class to implement that interface and for use in places where we want an instance of just `VersionOrdinal` without the restrictions in `Version` (mainly that we can only have instances of known versions.)\r\n\r\n`GMSMemberData`, which is the state holder for a `MemberIdentifier` now has a `VersionOrdinal` where it used to have a `Version`. `getVersion()` has been renamed `getVersionOrdinalObject()` and now returns a `VersionOrdinal` where it used to return a `Version`. Since _all_ the callers needed only comparison ops on that return value, the changes to call sites were trivial, if widespread. (Most of the files affected by this PR have those call sites and in every case the change was merely to change a method parameter, field, or local variable declaration from `Version` to `VersionOrdinal`.\r\n\r\nAlso since `Version` isa `VersionOrdinal` they are cross-comparable.\r\n\r\nI think this new `VersionOrdinal` type is more in the spirit of the old code (from before the bug was introduced.) That code carried `short` version ordinals around. The old `GMSMember` class (which later became `GMSMembeData`) had a `short versionOrdinal` field. This new `VersionOrdinal` class does that one better by giving us a place to hang the comparsion and hashing ops and gives us a type/subtype relationship between `VersionOrdinal` (any version ordinal, known or unknown) and `Version` (a known version.)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if, when you asked for a `VersionOrdinal`, if that represented a known version, i.e. a `Version`, that you'd actually get the pertinent `Version` object back. A factory, `Versioning.getVersionOrdinal(short ordinal)` was introduced fore this purpose. Only that factory is allowed to construct `VersionOrdinalImpl`. As was the case before this PR, `Version` has no public constructor at all—it is essentially an enumerated type.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe original PR that pointed out this bug https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5224 enhanced `RollingUpgradeDUnitTest` to check the versions (of each member) in the view reported by gfsh after a rolling upgrade. The fix to `GMSMemberData` was backported to a feature branch off of `support/1.12` and the modified `RollingUpgradeDUnitTest` passed ✓\r\n\r\nA new unit test `GMSMemberDataVersionDUnitTest` was added to verify that it's now possible to set an unknown version (ordinal) on `GMSMemberData` without loss of information.\r\n\r\nSo much for the bug itself. But what about 1.12.0 coordinators running in the wild with the bug? \r\n\r\nDuring an upgrade a locator will receive a bad view from one of those. \"Compensating\" code was added to `GMSJoinLeave.installView()` to patch up bad member version data arriving in a view from a compromised coordinator. See the call to `GMSMembershipView.correctWrongVersionIn(final ID memberID)` in `GMSJoinLeave.installView()`.\r\n\r\nA new unit test, `GMSJoinLeaveJUnitTest.repairWrongVersionInView()` was added to test the compensation logic. As an additional test, the new `RollingUpgradeDUnitTest` was verified passing for all old Geode versions, including an un-repaired 1.12.0.\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous Things I Hope You'll Check Me On\r\n\r\n* `sanctionedDataSerializables.txt` in `geode-core` changed. It's odd to me that there were apparently a bunch of `geode-membership` classes in that file before this PR. I don't think they should have been there. Nevertheless it's a mystery as to why they were and I'd like another opinion on that file. Also please double-check the (non-deletion) changes to that file—I checked 'em but they need a double-check.\r\n\r\n## For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

ready for review**\r\n\r\nThis was a first attempt at a fix for GEODE-8240. It'll be abandoned after the ultimate fix (that merged to `develop` on 6/30) makes it through the CI pipeline. Bear with me for a little longer please.\r\n\r\nThis is a minimalist approach to trying to fix the bug, by allowing `GMSMemberData` to hold unknown (ordinal) product versions received through serialization. Rather than having `GMSMemberData` store a `Version` it stores a `short` to represent the ordinal version. When a caller needs the `Version` it can get it from get it.\r\n\r\nA problem arises when a caller needs to recover a `Version` from the ordinal (`short1`) though. It leaves us with two bad options when that ordinal value represents an unknown product version:\r\n\r\n1. collapse all unknown product versions into `Version.CURRENT` (silently)\r\n2. allow `UnsupportedSerializationVersionException` to escape `getVersion()`\r\n\r\nThe former (1) is another version of the very bug we seek to fix. We have just moved it from the set-side (eager) to the get side (lazy). The latter (2) is bad because some callers actually might want (like `GMSMemberData`) to be able to handle unknown product versions. That exception does not differentiate between impossible product version ordinals e.g. -5 and possible-but-unknown ones e.g. 12467.\r\n\r\nA separate PR: https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5273 seeks to resolve the mess by introducing a new type: `VersionOrdinal`.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

of SSLEngine with NIO has proven to be less robust than using\r\n\"old-io\" SSLSockets.  This draft PR reintroduces SSLSockets into cluster\r\ncommunications for performance and functional testing.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the org.apache.geode.internal.tcp package is left\r\nintact.  None of the old code including Connection.runOioReader() has\r\nbeen brought back.  Code differences between use of NIO and OIO are\r\nminimal and are at the socket-read/socket-write level.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

we ran Build, then all <x>Test jobs in parallel (which takes ~5 hours), then all Benchmark<x> jobs (which takes ~5 hours).\r\n\r\nPresumably the benchmarks were run after all tests, on the premise that benchmarks are meaningless if the code is not correct.  However, required PR checks now prevent incorrect code from getting into develop in the first place, and the remaining occasional failures are flaky, so it's rather arbitrary to gate benchmarks on a lottery.\r\n\r\nHowever, faster feedback has clear benefits, hence this PR to cut our CI pipeline from 10 hours to 5 hours.\r\n\r\nAlso eliminates redundant jobs (ApiCheck and UnitTest are deterministic and already have required JDK11 flavors in the PR pipeline, so JDK8 flavor only is more than sufficient in the develop pipeline)\r\n\r\nAlso decreases benchmarks max_in_flight from 3 to 2, since now that we have support branches, we don't want to max our quota just from develop.
