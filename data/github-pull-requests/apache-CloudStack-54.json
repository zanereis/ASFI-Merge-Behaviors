is the longer description of the problem:\r\n\r\nBy default XenServer limits HVM guests to only 4 disks. Two of those are reserved for the ROOT disk (deviceId=0) and CD ROM (device ID=3) which means that we can only attach 2 data disks. This limit however is removed when Xentools is installed on the guest. The information that a guest has Xentools installed and can handle more than 4 disks is stored in the VM metadata on XenServer. When a VM is shut down, Cloudstack removes the VM and all the metadata associated with the VM from XenServer. Now, when you start the VM again, even if it has Xentools installed, it will default to only 4 attachable disks.\r\n\r\nNow this problem manifests itself when you have a HVM VM and you stop and start it with more than 2 data disks attached. The VM fails to start and the only way to start the VM is to detach the extra disks and then reattach them after the VM start.\r\n\r\nIn this fix, I am removing the check which is done before creating a `VBD` which enforces this limit. This will not affect current workflow and will fix the HVM issue.\r\n\r\n@koushik-das this is related to the \"autodetect\" feature that you introduced a while back (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-8826). I would love your review on this fix.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-14T16:48:01Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T06:10:25Z","closed_at":"2017-02-28T00:21:50Z","merged_at":"2017-02-28T00:21:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"966814b07d438c3d9eac415c54c1b4bdbf1911f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/2","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/2","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/2/labels","id":2457914,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjQ1NzkxNA==","number":2,"title":"4.10.0.0","description":"4.10.0.0

Start instance fails after reverting to a VM snapshot when there are child VM snapshots\r\n\r\nIssue\r\n====\r\nStart instance fails after reverting to a VM snapshot, when there is 1 or more child VM snapshots in the snapshot tree of the VM.\r\nPer the code, the method hasSnapshot() is supposed to detect the presence of any snapshot for the VM. But we are checking for only current snapshot instead of checking presence of any snapshot in the snapshot tree.\r\nThe failure to detect all snapshots means ACP reconfigures the VM in wrong way assuming there are no snapshots for the VM.\r\nThis results in start failure.\r\n\r\nFix\r\n===\r\nEnsure correct detection of VM snapshots in the VM snapshot

\"vmware.systemvm.nic.device.type\" to vmxnet3.\r\n-> Created a VPC network and deployed a VM using the same network.\r\n-> Checked the router details and found that for private network , it was showing nic adapter type as VMXNET3 and for other networks (public and guest) it was showing as E1000.\r\n-> Rebooted the VPC network and checked it again, it was same as earlier.\r\n\r\n/vmfs/volumes/3e5dffc5-9b91346e/r-2805-VM # grep virtualDev r-2805-VM.vmx\r\npciBridge4.virtualDev = \"pcieRootPort\"\r\npciBridge5.virtualDev =

shared network fails with Error.\r\nWhile creating a shared network it fails to create with Error \"The new IP range you have specified has overlapped with the guest network in the zone: XYZ. Please specify a different gateway/netmask\"\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n===============\r\n1. Create an isolated network with a subnet eg: 10.1.1.0/24\r\n2. Create a shared network with the same subnet but different VLAN, we should observe this issue.\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour:\r\n===============\r\nIt shouldn't restrict the creation of the guest network with the same subnet as long as they are segmented by VLAN.\r\n\r\nACTUAL BEHAVIOR:\r\n===============\r\nIt doesn't allow the creation of shared guest networks if there is any isolated guest network using the same subnet although it allows using the same subnet in multiple shared networks.\r\n\r\nCause:\r\n=====\r\nThe issue is happening because, when Shared network is getting created we are checking if there is any guest network already implemented with the same CIDR and throwing the error without checking if they are having same VLAN also. Creating the same CIDR shared network with different VLAN should be allowed.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\n===\r\nWhen creating a shared network, if there is any existing guest network with the same CIDR, we check if they are having the same VLAN, if they are in same VLAN, then we don't allow creating it.

Set global setting enable.dynamic.scale.vm to true\r\n2. Create a custom Compute Offerings A\r\n3. Create a VM instance apply A, ie. cpuNumber=1,cpuSpeed=1000,memory=512M\r\n4. Create another custom Compute Offerings B\r\n5. Change service offering to B, ie. cpuNumber=2,cpuSpeed=2000,memory=4096M (ensure 4 times over previous memory size), then you will encounter scaling failed\r\n6. Stop VM instance , you will never startup again\r\n\r\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR\r\n==================\r\nSucceed Startup VM instance\r\n\r\nACTUAL BEHAVIOR\r\n==================\r\nFail to start instance\r\n\r\n\r\nRCA:\r\nThe ROLLBACK does not take care of restoring old service offering details. In case failure we are removing the new service offering details but restoring old service offering details is missing.\r\n\r\nBefore Fix:\r\n`user_vm_details before upgrade.\r\nmysql> select * from

ticket** \r\nCLOUDSTACK-9624 Incorrect hypervisor mapping of guest os Windows 2008 Server R2 (64-bit) for VMware\r\n\r\n**Issue**\r\nGuest OS Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit) is being mapped to incorrect guest os at hypervisor, which is winLonghorn64Guest, same as that of Windows Server 2008 (64-bit).\r\nDue to this the VM's guest os type was set to \"Other (64-bit)\", which would not represent the guest OS accurately on hypervisor.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nFix is to update incorrect guest_os_name field value in DB table cloud.guest_os_hypervisor.\r\nTh query is,\r\nUPDATE IGNORE `cloud`.`guest_os_hypervisor` SET guest_os_name = 'windows7Server64Guest' WHERE guest_os_id IN (SELECT id FROM guest_os WHERE display_name LIKE 'windows%2008%r2%64%') AND hypervisor_type = 'VMware' AND hypervisor_version != 'default';\r\n\r\nAfter running above query, the 6 updated rows looks like\r\n\r\nUPDATE IGNORE `cloud`.`guest_os_hypervisor` SET guest_os_name = 'windows7Server64Guest' WHERE guest_os_id IN (SELECT id FROM guest_os WHERE display_name LIKE 'windows%2008%r2%64%') AND hypervisor_type = 'VMware' AND hypervisor_version != 'default';\r\nQuery OK, 6 rows affected (0.01

for developing and maintaining CloudStack!\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the attached trivial patch that lets the KVM storage pool use more than one type of storage adaptor?  If a disk is handled by another adaptor and a request to disconnect it comes in, the KVM storage pool might hand it off to the iSCSI storage adaptor first.  With the current iSCSI adaptor code, it will recognize that the disk is not one of its own and return \"true\", signalling to the storage pool that the disk has been successfully disconnected.  The patch makes it return \"false\" so that the storage pool will pass the request to the *next* storage adaptor in the pool which might very well actually handle it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your time and attention, and keep up the great work!\r\n\r\nBest

have multiple network interfaces.\r\nIt is not possible to set a NAT rule on any of the interfaces except the first interface of the VM from UI. Because the UI only lists the IPs of the first interface.\r\n\r\nThe rules can only be set on the \"default\" interface but even after setting the secondary as the default interface the outcome is still the same. Only the first interface is listed in the UI as available for setting NAT rules.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n===============\r\n1. Create two networks.\r\n2. Create a VM.\r\n3. Attach both the networks to the VM.\r\n4. Create NAT rules using both the networks.\r\n5. Observe the add VM section while creating the rule.\r\n6.

Either API documentation is wrong or code path needs to be corrected. If we pass both account and projectId parameters to the dedicateGuestVlanRange (which are not mentioned as mutually exclusive in API description) the API layer throws error saying both are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n===============\r\nCreate an account. Create a project in that account.\r\n\r\nGo to Admin account and change the view to the above project.\r\n\r\nNavigate to Infrastructure -> Zone -> Physical Network -> Guest -> Dedicate Guest VLAN range.\r\n\r\nTry to dedicate the guest VLAN range from the project view for the account associated with the project.\r\n\r\nIt fails with error saying \"accountName and projectId are mutually

the account field of API to optional.\r\nEven if the account name is passed while adding from a particular project view, then it is ignored in API.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n=====\r\nIf we do the dedication from default view then it works fine as no projectId is associated over

PR is to address a few issues in #1600 (which was recently merged to master for 4.10).\r\n\r\nIn StorageSystemDataMotionStrategy.performCopyOfVdi we call getSnapshotDetails. In one such scenario, the source snapshot in question is coming from secondary storage (when we are creating a new volume on managed storage from a snapshot of ours that’s on secondary storage).\r\n\r\nThis usually “worked” in the regression tests due to a bit of \"luck\": We retrieve the ID of the snapshot (which is on secondary storage) and then try to pull out its StorageVO object (which is for primary storage). If you happen to have a primary storage that matches the ID (which is the ID of a secondary storage), then getSnapshotDetails populates its Map<String, String> with inapplicable data (that is later ignored) and you don’t easily see a problem. However, if you don’t have a primary storage that matches that ID (which I didn’t today because I had removed that primary storage), then a NullPointerException is thrown.\r\n\r\nI have fixed that issue by skipping getSnapshotDetails if the source is coming from secondary storage.\r\n\r\nWhile fixing that, I noticed a couple more problems:\r\n\r\n1)       We can invoke grantAccess on a snapshot that’s actually on secondary storage (this doesn’t amount to much because the VolumeServiceImpl ignores the call when it’s not for a primary-storage driver).\r\n2)       We can invoke revokeAccess on a snapshot that’s actually on secondary storage (this doesn’t amount to much because the VolumeServiceImpl ignores the call when it’s not for a primary-storage driver).\r\n\r\nI have corrected those issues, as well.\r\n\r\nI then came across one more problem:\r\n·         When using a SAN snapshot and copying it to secondary storage or creating a new managed-storage volume from a snapshot of ours on secondary storage, we attach to the SR in the XenServer code, but detach from it in the StorageSystemDataMotionStrategy code (by sending a message to the XenServer code to perform an SR detach). Since we know to detach from the SR after the copy is done, we should detach from the SR in the XenServer code (without that code having to be explicitly called from outside of the XenServer logic).\r\n\r\nI went ahead and changed that, as well.\r\n\r\nJIRA

PR contains changes mainly related to enhancing managed storage on KVM. I recently added these features to a custom build of 4.5 for a prospect (and, here, I'd like to place these changes in master):\r\n\r\nAllow zone-wide primary storage based on a custom plug-in to be added via the GUI in a KVM-only environment.\r\n\r\nSupport for root disks on managed storage with KVM\r\n\r\nTemplate caching with managed storage and KVM\r\n\r\nSupport for volume snapshots with managed storage on KVM\r\n\r\nAdded the ability to revert a volume to a snapshot on KVM\r\n\r\nUpdated some integration tests\r\n\r\nEnforce that a SolidFire volume’s Min IOPS cannot exceed 15,000 and its Max and Burst IOPS cannot exceed 100,000.\r\n\r\nA SolidFire volume must be at least one GB.\r\n\r\nThe storage driver should not remove the row from the cloud.template_spool_ref table.\r\n\r\nEnable cluster-scoped managed storage\r\n\r\nOnly volumes from zone-wide managed storage can be storage motioned from a host in one cluster to a host in another cluster (cannot do so at the time being with volumes from cluster-scoped managed storage).\r\n\r\nUpdates for SAN-assisted snapshots\r\n\r\nJIRA

Part 1: Redesign storage tags\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nPrimary storage tags are being saved as an entry on `storage_pool_details` with:\r\n* name = TAG_NAME\r\n* value = \"true\"\r\n\r\nWhen a boolean property is defined in {{storage_pool_details}} and has value = \"true\", it is displayed as a tag.\r\n\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12836196/PS-DETAILS.PNG

Tags` for Primary Storage view, to list only tags, as it is done in Host Tags (Hosts view).\r\n\r\n## Part 2: Remove details from listImageStores API call response and UI\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn Secondary Storage view we propose removing `Details` field, as `Setting` tab list details for a given image store.

PR is a merge of @jayapalu changes in #872 and the changes I had to make to get the functionality working.\n\nI have done pretty extensive testing of this code so far and we are looking to be in pretty good shape.  One thing to note is that a `Diffie-Hellman` group **is required** in order for this feature to work correctly.  It is not highlighted in the tests below, but I have shown that the `PFS` is not required for this feature to work.  In #872 I have shown a more exhaustive set of tests of this code, but I have limited this set of tests to a recommended `IKE` and `ESP` configuration in order to reduce the noise and test the other areas of functionality.\n\n**Test Results**\nI am testing this functionality by creating two VPCs with VMs in each and creating a S2S VPN connection between the two VPCs. Then I SSH into a VM in one VPC and I ping the private IP of a VM in the other VPC. Then I tear it down and try a different configuration.\n\n_Setup_\n\n```\nVPC 1                          VPC 2               \n=====                          =====               \nVPN Gateway                    VPN Gateway         \nVPN Customer Gateway           VPN Customer Gateway\nVPN Connection        <--->    VPN Connection\n - Passive = True               - Passive = False\n```\n\n_Legend_\n`SKIP` => At least one of the VPN Connections did not come up, so no test was run.\n`OK` => The ping test was successful over the S2S VPN connection.\n`FAIL` => The ping test failed over the S2S VPN connection.\n\n`Passive` => Specifies if either the `<vpc_1> : <vpc_2>` sides of the VPN Connection is set to passive.\n`Conn State` => Specifies the connection status of the `<vpc_1> : <vpc_2>` VPN Connection in the UI.\n`Requires Reset` => If the ping test does not result in an `OK`, then a VPN Connection Reset is performed on either `<vpc_1> : <vpc_2>` sides of the VPN Connection based on which side is not showing `Connected`.  The results in the `Status` column is the final result after the reset is performed.\n\n_Results_\n\n```\n+--------+----------------------+-------+-------+----------+----------+---------------+-----------------------------+----------------+\n| Status | IKE & ESP

Wait until ACS created the snapshot. ACS is creating a snapshot on local storage and is transferring this snapshot to secondary storage. But the latest snapshot on local storage will stay there. This is as expected.\n4. Migrate the instance to another XenServer host with ACS UI and Storage Live Migration\n5.
