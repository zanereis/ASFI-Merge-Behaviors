pull request includes the following improvements to the ``ParamikoSSHClient`` client and related ``deploy_node()`` functionality which utilizes paramiko SSH client.\r\n\r\n1. ``put()`` method now tries to re-use the existing sftp connection (if one is already opened) for successive calls to ``ssh_client.put()`` method.\r\n\r\nThis should speed up ``deploy_node()`` functionality when uploading multiple files (aka using multiple ``FileDeployment`` steps), because it means we don't need to close and re-open sftp connection for each call to ``put()`` method.\r\n\r\n2. Add new ``keep_alive`` and ``use_compression`` arguments to the ``ParamikoSSHClient`` class constructor. At this point, those arguments are not exposed directly to the ``deploy_node()`` method yet.\r\n\r\n3. Add new ``putfo()`` method to the ``ParamikoSSHClient`` class and update ``FileDeployment.run()`` method to use this method instead of ``put()``.\r\n\r\nThis method is much more efficient than ``put()`` because it means we don't need to buffer the whole file content in memory when calling ``file_deployment_step.run()`` and we can also utilize pipelining.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that ``FileDeployment`` was primarily meant for uploading small script files and not large binary files, but based on testing, this change substantially increases performance when uploading larger binary files using ``FileDeployment`` class (I've seen speed ups of up to 80% in favor of the new implementation).\r\n\r\n4. I implemented and worked on top of a change originally proposed by @ArthurKamalov which fixes ``put()`` method so it correctly handles absolute file paths when executing commands on Windows machine.","created_at":"2020-08-20T17:30:24Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T13:07:29Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T13:07:28Z","merged_at":"2020-08-21T13:07:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ddda6ab6e87a1f46c3b16ec1af976ba7041ebf6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1443523377,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQzNTIzMzc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute:%20ssh","name":"api: compute: ssh","color":"93e276","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2289789650,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg5Nzg5NjUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute:%20deploy%20node","name":"api: compute: deploy node","color":"21b6c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2289789996,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg5Nzg5OTk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute:%20ssh:%20paramiko","name":"api: compute: ssh: paramiko","color":"47d877","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1483/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1483/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1483/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/8616818e59834a5a2377e37ded19f3421b7019d3","head":{"label":"Kami:paramiko_compression_and_keepalive","ref":"paramiko_compression_and_keepalive","sha":"8616818e59834a5a2377e37ded19f3421b7019d3","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

Driver for VMware's vSphere cloud\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis contains two drivers, one that works with VMware's SOAP API through a python client called pyVmomi, and one that works with VMware's newly introduced REST API. The more complete is the former since the REST API is lacking functionality as of yet, still all common driver functions beyond list_images will work. Images for the scope of this work are considered either ovf files or vm templates, some of these templates are not returned by the REST endpoint and thus the choice was made to use the SOAP driver as well, instead of having a lacking method. Also snapshot and console methods require the SOAP driver. If the pyVmomi dependency is missing, using these methods will result in an ImportError. The driver also contains async code, during the driver's design and testing, an environment with over 3k VM-s was used among others. This lead to the realization that the usual way of writing list_nodes gets slow very fast for large number of nodes, especially when there is a need of a _to_node helper method that does more requests for each node. There is a \"flag\" argument in the list_nodes method for whether to proceed asynchronously or not, but the existence of async code requires python 3.5+. The included tests are checking only the REST driver methods. Despite these drawbacks, the authors decided to publish this driver, since vSphere is popular and it works very well. \r\n \r\n\r\n### Status\r\nReplace this: describe the PR status.

New driver for vSphere\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWith this driver one can manage a vSphere environment, the connection is made with a vCenter server, it might not work with just the ESXi host. This driver has a dependency called pyvmomi that can be installed with `pip install pyvmomi`, it is needed since the REST API of vSphere is not robust enough yet. The REST API driver will work, except list_images, snapshot methods and console method which need the SOAP driver. Images in this driver are considered  VM templates or ovf files. The REST APIdriver also lacks the ability to clone a VM due to insufficient endpoints of the API. The added tests check core functionality of the REST driver only.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently to retrieve a network from the OpenStack all networks need to be received. Then these can be filtered by ID. If the ID of the network is known it is not needed to retrieve all networks from the OpenStack.\r\n\r\nBy creating a function called `ex_get_network` and passing an ID we could retrieve a single network, this would increase performance for some systems.

Azure  ARM Pricing\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nA scrape script for ARM prices. The driver will need adaptation in the future since at the moment each size has a price of 0. After the script is run pricing.json will be populated with azure prices in the format azure_linux -->  size (with no spaces all lower case) --> region --> price. For the moment it scrapes prices for azure_linux (without extra cost due to image) and azure_windows, in the future more premium images can be added if the scrape url is parsed properly.\r\n###

Changes Title \r\nEC2 pricing update\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe main url from which prices were scraped is deprecated, this introduces a new url and a  new location (Stockholm). The format in which the prices are to be saved in the pricing.json file is also changed, now it is ec2_linux (or ec2_windows) --> size --> region --> price. This was done for convenience, some regions do not have some sizes and in other clouds the price might default to another region, this way it is easier to introduce a default, also it is easier to add prices for different premium images in the future like RHEL and SLES. For the moment only windows prices are being scraped besides the linux ones (free images), even though for libcloud's current needs windows prices are not necessary. The driver is also changed so prices can be fetched correctly. This request does not include the resulting constants.py and pricing.json after the scripts are run. If it should please let me know.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

pull request adds support for managing ``CAA`` record types.\r\n\r\nRight now it supports and has been tested with CloudFlare and Gandi Live DNS driver.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that it also works with some other provider drivers (either out of the box or they need to be updated), but I didn't test it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, this PR also includes some other improvements and fixes:\r\n\r\n* Update CloudFlare DNS driver so we include whole error chain in the exception error message. This makes various issues easier to debug since the whole context is included.\r\n\r\n* Fix ``create_ecord`` method in the Gandi Live DNS driver to not throw if ``exra['rrset_ttl']`` argument is not passed to the method.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [x] Docs\r\n- [x] Add release notes entry (document expect format for data field for CAA records)\r\n\r\nResolves #1463.","created_at":"2020-06-01T14:45:17Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T20:48:43Z","closed_at":"2020-06-06T20:48:43Z","merged_at":"2020-06-06T20:48:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"780f3707934d9abbbcd2436cedd3285b765f53d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1417971536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDE3OTcxNTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20dns","name":"api: dns","color":"a062bc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1417971582,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDE3OTcxNTgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/drivers:%20cloudflare","name":"drivers: cloudflare","color":"b290ed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1470571631,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcwNTcxNjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/drivers:%20gandi%20live","name":"drivers: gandi live","color":"d69c51","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1464/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1464/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1464/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/2de04ad92534c4dedc5f249401724bb0f44918a6","head":{"label":"Kami:caa_record_type","ref":"caa_record_type","sha":"2de04ad92534c4dedc5f249401724bb0f44918a6","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

pull request addresses the issue reported in #1452.\r\n\r\nIt makes sure we don't url encode ``~`` character in the internal driver ``_clean_object_name`` method.\r\n\r\nI tested the change and verified it works for objects with ``~`` in the name.\r\n\r\n## Background, Context\r\n\r\n@mmilitzer reported this issue in 1452.\r\n\r\nI was able to replicate the bug in the S3 driver.\r\n\r\nAs far as changed Python 3 behavior goes - I tested it using Python 3.6 and ``~`` is still url encoded by default.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the change itself was introduced in 3.7 - https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/21024f06622c4c55b666adb130797a4ee205d005#diff-67a4980d053b561c26794c63eb5ac1deR461.\r\n\r\nThat's why I decided it's safer to only make that change in the S3 driver to begin with.\r\n\r\nDoing it inside our ``urlquote`` wrapper may be too risky - who knows how many provider APIs (if any) on ``~`` being encoded as ``%7E``.","created_at":"2020-05-03T20:07:41Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T10:38:48Z","closed_at":"2020-05-11T10:38:47Z","merged_at":"2020-05-11T10:38:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"881d5fb0b8973a0f1037e0aa0d3538b407f57d26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1394383274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0MzgzMjc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/bug%20fix","name":"bug

Implement `get_object_cdn_url` for S3 using pre-signed urls\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAllows the s3 driver to generate [pre-signed URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) using the `get_object_cdn_url` method. Anyone in possession of these URLs can _read_ the object until the URL expires. (As suggested in issue #1403)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n - I've tried to follow the example of PR #1408 - which implements that Azure version of this function - as much as possible.\r\n - to prevent code duplication, this calls some internal functions from the `AWSRequestSignerAlgorithmV4` class.\r\n - many providers use the S3 driver. Because this is tied specifically to AWS's authentication methods, I had to modify a few tests to make sure that this doesn't change behavior elsewhere. \r\n\r\n(Long-time user, first-time PR-opener - happy to make changes as needed)\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nReady for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [x]

pull request includes the following fixes and improvements to ``deploy_node()`` functionality.\r\n\r\n* Add support for Ed25519 private keys when using paramiko >= 2.2.0.\r\n\r\n* Update ``deploy_node()`` so it immediately propagates a fatal exception (e.g. key is password protected, but password is not provided, invalid password is provided for password protected keys, invalid key type is used. Previously we would incorrectly try to retry on such exception which means the exception would only bubble up after retry attempts were exhausted (aka default 600 seconds timeout for deploy node).\r\n\r\n* Allow user to specify password for password protected keys by passing ``ssh_key_password`` to ``deploy_node()`` method.\r\n\r\n* Fix ``deploy_node()`` so we immediately propagate the error and don't try to retry on ``SSHCommandTimeoutError`` exception.\r\n\r\n* Add new ``timeout`` argument to ``ScriptDeployment`` and ``ScriptFileDeployment`` class constructor. This allows user to specify optional timeout for those deployment steps.\r\n\r\n* Add new ``at_exit_func`` argument to ``deploy_node()`` method. With this argument user can specify which function will be called before exiting with the created node in question if the deploy process has been canceled after the node has been created, but before the method has fully finished.","created_at":"2020-03-31T21:46:03Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T09:52:45Z","closed_at":"2020-04-02T09:52:45Z","merged_at":"2020-04-02T09:52:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ecb752c58df61efed646c5c08c4a3a11ccb7217","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1394383433,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0MzgzNDMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute","name":"api: compute","color":"ffbac7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1443523377,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQzNTIzMzc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute:%20ssh","name":"api: compute: ssh","color":"93e276","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1851650930,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODUxNjUwOTMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/potential%202.8.x%20candidate","name":"potential 2.8.x candidate","color":"5448d6","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1445/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1445/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1445/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/4ae4fe9fed5ba40f7b07da80dc4965370a320019","head":{"label":"Kami:better_key_handling","ref":"better_key_handling","sha":"4ae4fe9fed5ba40f7b07da80dc4965370a320019","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

start a voting thread in the next couple of days) so I decided to cherry pick some bug fixes from trunk and include them in the v2.8.1 release.\r\n\r\nYou can think of v2.8.x branch of Libcloud as a LTS release which still supports Python 2.7. All the new features will land in future v3.x.x releases, but for a while we may also do some more releases in the v2.8.x series if a major bug or security issue is found.","created_at":"2020-02-29T21:05:33Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T21:45:26Z","closed_at":"2020-02-29T22:12:46Z","merged_at":"2020-02-29T22:12:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"4dcb8f9d95ac9fddd067b135f84f85052b156b9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/53603c9585ef92b90e23d882f767e913e9225e96","head":{"label":"Kami:v2.8.1-changes","ref":"v2.8.1-changes","sha":"53603c9585ef92b90e23d882f767e913e9225e96","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

Make id lower for consistent uuid generation\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen a node is created, the resource groups name in the id string is lower case. In subsequent calls, like in list_nodes(), for some reason Azure returns the resource groups name in upper case. This results in a different uuid from when create_node is called. This also breaks wait_until_running(). Forcing lower case in _to_node() seems to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Code

pull request adds two new methods to the base storage API for downloading object range aka part of an object - ``download_object_range`` and ``download_object_range_as_stream``.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I added new methods and not new arguments to the existing ``download_object`` and ``download_object_as_stream`` methods is because of how \"advertisement\" of supported methods and functionality works in Libcloud.\r\n\r\nIf I added a new argument, there would be no easy programatically detectable way for driver to \"advertise\" that it support range download functionality.\r\n\r\nOur option would be to throw an exception saying that this functionality is not supported if user passed in ``start_bytes`` or similar argument to that method, but the problem is that this would require us or user to actually run a method to determine if that functionality is available.\r\n\r\nTo begin with I implemented it for the following drivers:\r\n\r\n- S3 (tested it with AWS S3 and Google Storage)\r\n- Local storage\r\n\r\nI also planned to look into adding it to the Azure driver.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Test\r\n- [x] Code refactor to avoid some duplicated code\r\n- [x] Documentation

pull request includes a couple of GCP auth and GKE driver fixes / improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Fix ``list_clusters()`` method in GKE driver and make sure it returns ``ContainerCluster`` object instances. Previously it incorrectly returned raw dict as returned by the API.\r\n2. Make sure ``list_clusters()`` works if ``ex_zone`` argument is not specified (aka listing clusters for all the zones)\r\n3. Make sure we specify correct default auth scope otherwise authentication will fail aka driver won't work.\r\n4. Update ``GoogleOAuth2Credential`` class and make sure we include hashed version of the used authentication scopes in the name of the file which is used to cache the auth token. If we don't do that, this class will try to incorrectly used the old / invalid cached auth token when user changes the value for the ``scopes=`` driver constructor argument.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this will invalidate any existing cached token on Libcloud upgrade, but this shouldn't be a big deal since those tokens are short lived anyway.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Changelog entry","created_at":"2020-02-08T21:06:13Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T17:43:21Z","closed_at":"2022-01-29T17:43:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b96ed3171204cbccb75deb97bf68f9f503d42136","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1417970689,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDE3OTcwNjg5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20common","name":"api: common","color":"384bb7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1747331478,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzQ3MzMxNDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/drivers:%20gke","name":"drivers: gke","color":"ffe9a3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1747331796,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzQ3MzMxNzk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20container","name":"api: container","color":"90f4e4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3477056049,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAZm487PP6ox","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/status:%20wip","name":"status: wip","color":"904DA1","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1423/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1423/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1423/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/5fedbd15c8e5fe22ded572b8420a5d2eb688729f","head":{"label":"Kami:google_driver_credential_file_handling_improvements","ref":"google_driver_credential_file_handling_improvements","sha":"5fedbd15c8e5fe22ded572b8420a5d2eb688729f","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

pull request updates Kubernetes container driver so it now also supports client side certificate and static bearer token authentication\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nPreviously the driver only supported HTTP basic auth which is now deprecated.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nMost of the code for handling various types of authentication mechanism was already there (either available in the Kubernetes container driver or the KubeVirt compute one),\r\nthis PR just updates it to make it more re-usable.\r\n\r\nThis way we avoid duplicated (copy and pasted) code and re-use those base connection classes by both of the Kubernetes driver.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tested the Kubernetes container driver and KubeVirt compute driver against a local minikube deployment.\r\n\r\nIt probably wouldn't hurt if KubeVirt one gets more testing (cc @Eis-D-Z).\r\n\r\nOn that note, for compliance with the base API (I missed that during the review), ``token_bearer_auth`` KubeVirt driver constructor argument has been renamed to ``ex_token_bearer_auth``.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor auth classes tests and also use them with the KubeVirt compute driver

pull request is an attempt to try to fix an issue reported in #1360.\r\n\r\n### Background / Problem Description\r\n\r\nCurrently ``list_nodes()`` method only returns up to 500 nodes (which is a page size value we use with our list requests and also a max page size limit set by Google).\r\n\r\nThis is true either when we are requesting nodes for all the zones (aggregated request) or when requesting nodes for a single zone.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Fix\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes that by utilizing ``request_aggregated_items`` method in both scenarios (when we are requesting nodes in all the zones and also when requesting nodes for a single zone).\r\n\r\nI tested the change by setting ``maxResults`` in the ``request_aggregated_items`` method to ``1`` and verified that all the pages are correctly retrieved since I don't have an account with more than 500 instances to test it out.\r\n\r\nI tested the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. List nodes for all the zones\r\n2. List nodes for a particular zones with multiple nodes in that zone\r\n3. List nodes for a particular zone with no nodes in that zones\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn a somewhat related note -  unless I'm missing something, it appears the same issue may also exist with other \"list\" API endpoints when retrieving items for a specific zone and that response contains more then max page size number of items (since we don't follow through pagination when requesting items for a single zone).\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the diff, this change also allowed me to simplify ``list_nodes()`` method. If my assertion / observation above is correct, this would mean we can also simplify other list methods.\r\n\r\n@erjohnso Please correct me if I'm wrong or missing something.\r\n\r\nResolves #1360.","created_at":"2020-01-14T06:27:25Z","updated_at":"2020-02-29T20:58:09Z","closed_at":"2020-01-24T08:40:08Z","merged_at":"2020-01-24T08:40:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba949215ce2a7c65a66206b4eb2aa892334c15d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"erjohnso","id":2154049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNTQwNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2154049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso","html_url":"https://github.com/erjohnso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erjohnso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1394383274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0MzgzMjc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/bug%20fix","name":"bug

Fix CI on Windows\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe Travis CI build on Windows is currently failing (e.g. see [5073.4](https://travis-ci.org/apache/libcloud/jobs/634519562) or [5074.4](https://travis-ci.org/apache/libcloud/jobs/634521136)) due to an error installing Python via Chocolatey.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the CI by updating the build to use the latest Python published to Chocolatey (3.8). This also required updating the cryptography dependency to the latest version (2.8) since the previously pinned version (2.6.1) doesn't include a wheel for Python 3.8 on Windows.\r\n\r\n###

Implemented chunked upload for Azure Blobs storage driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes https://github.com/apache/libcloud/issues/1399 by implementing chunked upload in the Azure Blobs storage driver via the [Put Block](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-block) and [Put Block List](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-block-list) APIs.\r\n\r\nThe implementation mostly leverages the `AzureBlobsStorageDriver._upload_in_chunks` function that was first introduced in [24f34c9](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/24f34c99c9440523a53e940a346bced551281953/libcloud/storage/drivers/azure_blobs.py#L732-L788) and was stopped being used in [6e0040d](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/6e0040d8904cacb5dbe88309e9051be08cdc59f9) with the the following main updates:\r\n\r\n- Enable setting object metadata, content-type and content-md5 for chunked uploads.\r\n\r\n- Drop support for PageBlob. **This is a breaking API change.** However, given the non-trivial differences between the PageBlob and BlockBlob APIs, I'd hypothesize that the improved simplicity of the code will aid in the long run with bugfixes and maintenance. If keeping support for PageBlob is a hard requirement, I suspect a non-trivial amount of refactoring would have to be undertaken to cleanly support chunked upload for both BlockBlob and PageBlob object types. I'm open to do the work as part of this pull request, but I'd love to first discuss the pros/cons of both approaches.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following companion changes were made:\r\n\r\n- Remove unused `upload_func` and `upload_func_kwargs` arguments in `StorageDriver._upload_object` ([7e55057](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/7e550577758cb95ec42819e77b6773566a180e5c))\r\n- Rationalize determination of content type to a new helper function `StorageDriver._determine_content_type` ([0dc5cbb](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/0dc5cbb0410fa3b1f9ca0d54b59d514cbc7e6c7a))\r\n- Switch `libcloud.utils.files.read_in_chunks` from type checking to duck-typing to ensure that more iterators (e.g. opened file objects) use the fast `read(int)` code-path ([0fded11](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/0fded110e69f020388d76d8094d3ca25fa868e13))\r\n- Make Azure Storage constants configurable via environment variables ([638a189](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1400/commits/638a18943b2992211564e63a26ec7421e6ca5339))\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code linting ([CI passed](https://travis-ci.org/CatalystCode/libcloud/builds/632547395))\r\n- [x] Documentation ([changelog

Promote `ex_prefix` to top-level storage SDK argument\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMost storage drivers implement `ex_prefix` for `list_container_objects` and `iterate_container_objects`. As such, this pull request promotes `ex_prefix` to a top-level argument. For each driver that didn't previously implement `ex_prefix`, a fallback to filter objects client-side is has also been added.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n###

KubeVirt  driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nKubevirt driver with initial support for the k8s/KubeVirt add-on.\r\n\r\nCan list, start, stop, destroy kubevirt type vm's from a kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\nCan create a Persistent Volume Claim with the assumption that the Persistent Volume will be created dynamically by Kubernetes, so a relevant storage class that allows for such provisioning must be declared. (You can list storage classes to view them)\r\n\r\nCan create a vm with a docker image with embedded disk as image, and as many persistent volume claims as desired. \r\n  - Network support is limited to 'pod' with 'bridge' or 'masquearde' type interfaces.\r\n - From the supported disk types of KubeVirt, containerDisk is used for the image, while only  persistentVolumeClaims can be added as disks. Disk types can either be \"disk\" or \"lun\" and the supported bus are \"virtio\", \"sata\" and \"scsi\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n\r\n- working driver, can be further extended to include more features, needs docstrings\r\n- Note: Many features of the driver are logically more suited to be in the Kubernetes container driver, please keep this in consideration in the review\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [ ]

a prevision version we added some more conditional dependencies - ``typing`` and ``enum34`` packages which are needed for Python versions older than 3.4.0.\r\n\r\nThose versions were dynamically included as part of ``install_requirements`` so the actual ``Reqires-Dist`` metadata entry which is part of the wheel file was not correct and depended on the version of Python which was used to generate the wheel.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes that by utilizing PEP 508 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#environment-markers) environment markers notation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, we also use ``extra_requires`` fallback notation for users who install Libcloud using old versions of pip and setuptools (reference: https://hynek.me/articles/conditional-python-dependencies/).\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this change now requires a Libcloud committer which is making a release to generate a wheel using a recent version of setuptools for the METADATA entries to be correct.\r\n\r\nI updated ``setup.py`` to fail on ``bdist_wheel`` command if an older version is used. I will also document this under committer docs.\r\n\r\nI tested it locally using various Python versions and confirmed it works correctly.\r\n\r\nThe universal wheel metadata now looks like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n...\r\nRequires-Dist: requests (>=2.5.0)\r\nRequires-Dist: backports.ssl-match-hostname ; python_version < \"2.7.9\"\r\nRequires-Dist: typing ; python_version < \"3.4.0\"\r\nRequires-Dist: enum34 ; python_version < \"3.4.0\"\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Note on supporting Python <= 3.4.0\r\n\r\nIn the very near future (#1377), we plan to drop support for Python <= 3.4.0.  At that point, this change won't be needed anymore and we will be able to simplify ``setup.py``.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I made this change is so we can make another release in the ``v2.x`` release series which contains the correct wheel metadata entries. This will be the last release which will support Python <= 3.4.0.\r\n\r\nIf we planned to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.0 for longer, I would probably also work on automated tests for this fix / change, but at this point, I don't think it's worth the effort since we will be dropping support for that versions soon.\r\n\r\nResolves #1392.\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to @arterrey for reporting this issue.","created_at":"2019-12-21T17:32:11Z","updated_at":"2019-12-23T13:14:19Z","closed_at":"2019-12-22T19:25:20Z","merged_at":"2019-12-22T19:25:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"617be30dc3997b3b4031c5f88ebcf478ba63ca61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1747049477,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzQ3MDQ5NDc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/build","name":"build","color":"10a02f","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1393/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1393/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1393/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/165151dcc2787c7ec9975d728cc977338b5aad99","head":{"label":"Kami:fix_wheel_metadata","ref":"fix_wheel_metadata","sha":"165151dcc2787c7ec9975d728cc977338b5aad99","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

pull request tries to mitigate / resolve an issue with legacy code / kwargs abuse brought up in #1383.\r\n\r\n## Description, Background\r\n\r\nCurrently a lot of ``create_node()`` method signatures use ``**kwargs`` instead of regular positional + keyword arguments.\r\n\r\nThat's bad for many reasons (makes code introspection hard / impossible, bad API, hard to follow and understand the code, etc.).\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for that is that ``deploy_node()`` method passes all the keyword argument it takes to ``create_node()`` method, even though majority of the arguments it takes are ``deploy_node()`` specific (ssh_username, max_tries, ssh_interface, etc.) and shouldn't be passed / propagated to ``create_node()``.\r\n\r\nOnly keyword argument which potentially needs to be propagated is ``auth`` argument. That argument is used by provider drivers which support password based SSH authentication (e.g. Linode).\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nThis solution updates ``deploy_node()`` code to only pass non deploy_node specific keyword arguments to the ``create_node()`` method.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason driver method throws (e.g. that driver still expects some deploy_node arguments which really shouldn't happen, but there might be some legacy code which does that out there), we simply fall back to the old approach and pass all the arguments to ``create_node()`` method.\r\n\r\nThis will allow drivers to still support ``deploy_node()`` functionality without needing to use ``**kwargs`` in ``create_node()`` method signature. They will be able to normally declare positional and keyword arguments they support in that method.\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Changelog entry\r\n- [x] Update some of the existing drivers to explicitly declare supported arguments in ``create_node()`` method instead of using ``**kwargs``","created_at":"2019-12-18T15:36:38Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T21:19:31Z","closed_at":"2019-12-20T21:19:31Z","merged_at":"2019-12-20T21:19:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d95ff61249d13c64adb6249e54bcfa059da9d86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1394383433,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0MzgzNDMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute","name":"api: compute","color":"ffbac7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1443523377,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQzNTIzMzc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute:%20ssh","name":"api: compute: ssh","color":"93e276","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/6b52ab509743f3db966da0f26858efd48eb071f1","head":{"label":"Kami:deploy_node_workaround","ref":"deploy_node_workaround","sha":"6b52ab509743f3db966da0f26858efd48eb071f1","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

GCENodeDriver's deploy_node() now accepts Deployments as well as all the parameters accepted by create_node()\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI've deleted the overridden `deploy_node()` function from `GCENodeDriver` so that it'd use base `NodeDriver`'s `deploy_node()` instead. This allows users to pass in `Deployment`s and other parameters accepted by `create_node()`. This is a backwards incompatible change, but it's simple to fix by using `ScriptFileDeployment` or setting the metadata with the content of the script manually.

Only guess host from region map if not explicitly set\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOverwriting host parameter is inconsistent with function signature and a breaking change compared with previous behavior. This change will respect the host if passed by the user but guess from the region if not explicitly passed.\r\n\r\nReason: If the user passes a host he expects it to be respected, be it because he wants to use a local proxy, test against a local server or any other reason not to use one of the predefined amazon servers.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1383 .\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\ndone, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n    should pass (tried to keep pep8 for that one extra line)\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n    small bug fix restores consistent behaviour -- no change vs documentation\r\n- [x] [Tests](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/testing.html)\r\n    CI shows unit tests passed.\r\n- [x] [ICLA](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#contributing-bigger-changes) (required for bigger changes)\r\n    a one liner surely doesn't require icla, I'm ticking the check for that reason.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-13T11:00:21Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T16:30:58Z","closed_at":"2019-12-13T16:27:20Z","merged_at":"2019-12-13T16:27:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c04f0049c8f615864ee3082abd2a3de33a6861c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1417963792,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDE3OTYzNzky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20storage","name":"api:

pull request updates the code and drops support for Python 2.7 and Python 3 < 3.5.0 (as discussed on the mailing list).\r\n\r\nThe plan is to release Libcloud v3.0.0 with those changes once Python 2.7 is officially EOL (January 1, 2020).\r\n\r\nFor people who still need to use Python 2.7 or Python 3 < 3.5.0, they can install older Libcloud release which still supports that version.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to first only drop support in ``setup.py`` and stop testing Libcloud with those versions, but in the future we also plan to refactor the code and get rid of all the ``libcloud.utils.py3`` and other Python 2 and Python 3 compatibility / glue code which won't be needed anymore.\r\n\r\nSince we will only support Python >= 3.5.0 it means we will also be able to utilize native type hinting syntax (no more comments).\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Changelog entry\r\n- [x] Update notes entry\r\n- [x] Blog post that announces that change\r\n- [x] Update ReadTheDocs configuration to build docs with

GCP Volumes - now with labels! \r\nThere was no support in the GCP provider for querying/setting labels on volumes - this adds that!\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn order to set the labels for a disk, the user is required to pass in the last labelFingerprint, which must be fetched first. This is done when building the StorageVolume object from a query, pull out the relevant fields (labels, labelFingerprint) and stuff them in the `extra` dictionary.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a new method has been added, `ex_set_volume_labels` which sets the labels for a given volume.\r\n\r\nFor more information on contributing, please see

pull request adds new ``start_node(self, node)`` and ``stop_node(self, node)`` methods to the base compute ``NodeDriver`` class.\r\n\r\nThis means those two methods have been \"promoted\" and are now part of the standard Libcloud compute API.\r\n\r\n### Background, Reasoning\r\n\r\nA big chunk of the existing compute drivers (18) already implemented this functionality as part of ``ex_start_node`` and ``ex_stop_node`` method so it only makes sense to promote those methods to be part of the standard compute API.\r\n\r\nFor backward compatibility reasons, existing extension methods are left in place and they continue to behave as they did in the previous releases. Those methods will be removed as part of a cleanup in a future major release.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Changelog entry\r\n- [x] Upgrade notes entry","created_at":"2019-11-26T21:25:12Z","updated_at":"2019-11-28T20:56:52Z","closed_at":"2019-11-28T20:56:52Z","merged_at":"2019-11-28T20:56:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"73186bf070d77667fdb190a610e0c29c9e3c2ade","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1394383433,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0MzgzNDMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute","name":"api: compute","color":"ffbac7","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1375/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1375/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1375/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/d706c7f262ab3759ddf59916d5919622b5c203fe","head":{"label":"Kami:promote_start_stop_node_methods","ref":"promote_start_stop_node_methods","sha":"d706c7f262ab3759ddf59916d5919622b5c203fe","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

Fix Azure compute driver to allow adding maximum number of disks when LUN is unspecified\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen the LUN is unspecified in the `attach_volume` method, it finds the lowest available number to attach the volume to. The maximum number of data disks on an Azure VM is 64, which means LUNs can range from 0 to 63.\r\n\r\nThe current logic to figure out the LUN iterates from 0 to 62: `for lun in range(0, 63)`. When you try to add the Nth device where N = maximum number of data disks allowed for that instance size, this code raises `LibcloudError(\"No LUN available to attach new disk.\")`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this to ensure the last LUN is usable.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [x]

pull request moves S3 driver from \"driver class per region\" model to \"single driver class with region constructor argument\" model.\r\n\r\nThis way it's consistent with other multi region providers and more pleasant for the end users.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to deprecate and remove those region specific class in a future major release.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that change, it also includes some other small changes:\r\n\r\n1. Add all the missing and supported regions to the S3 driver\r\n2. Incorporate changes from #1370 \r\n3. Update exception which is thrown if user is using driver for region X, but the bucket they wish to upload the object to is in region Y\r\n4. Fix and improve provider feature matrix generation script so it's more robust and excludes S3 class per region entries\r\n5. Add new ``provider-tables`` tox target for generating those provider tables in a consistent environment with all the dependencies\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [x] Upgrade notes entry\r\n\r\nResolves #1370 #1366","created_at":"2019-11-19T20:15:11Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T16:36:29Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T16:36:25Z","merged_at":"2019-11-20T16:36:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"2aad12ad42eb67a293a7bf675ce65a8e31c951a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1417963792,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDE3OTYzNzky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20storage","name":"api: storage","color":"6f6be5","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1598166682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTk4MTY2Njgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/drivers:%20aws%20s3","name":"drivers: aws s3","color":"ecfc85","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1371/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1371/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1371/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/7d16c17ef32013ca5a820d3679079f8360387ee0","head":{"label":"Kami:s3_driver_region_constructor_argument","ref":"s3_driver_region_constructor_argument","sha":"7d16c17ef32013ca5a820d3679079f8360387ee0","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

PR adds `ex_image_ref` to create_volume for the\r\nOpenStack_2_NodeDriver.

This is\r\nhelpful because for older versions of OpenStack it is not\r\npossible to create an instance with a block device mapping\r\nwhere the newly created volume has to be put in a

[Bug fix] GCE provider validation error when setting project scope metadata\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nA bug was detected when setting new metadata values into GCE project while using the GCE provider from libcloud \"trunk\" branch. Browsing through the code I noticed that arguments are not passed correctly to the gce driver (set common metadata), causing gce driver to return an error when setting metadata into a GCE project.\r\n\r\nError:\r\n- ValueError: Unsupported metadata format.\r\nSolution:\r\n- Removed unnecessary \"self\" argument to ex_set_common_instance_metadata and included force argument, which was currently missing.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [X] [Code

Reuse TCP connections when uploading files\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt's easy to break connection reuse when using the requests API: just use `stream=True` and never read the response. The connection used to make the request will never be reused, and will be dropped when the urllib3's connection pool is full.\r\n\r\nIt turns out uploading objects using the S3 API goes through `prepared_request`, which incorrectly sets `stream` to the value of `raw`, `True` in our case. And since we don't read the response data, the connection are never reused, and each upload requires its own connection.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly wasteful when uploading many small objects, which can easily happen with JSON or Parquet files generated by Apache Spark, where setting up the connection takes significant time compared to uploading a few bytes.\r\n\r\nSetting `stream=stream` in the `prepared_request` method matches the code in the `request` method and fixes the bug.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- work in progress\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code
