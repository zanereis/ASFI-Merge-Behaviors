Let's not merge until we've come to a consensus.  I'll update the PR when we do.\r\n- I've turned off warnings as errors for this build.

code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible

Description ##\r\nSomewhat  similar with ```fixed_param_names``` in ```mx.mod.Module()```, which can set attr of some specified paramter.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n```selected_param_names``` may be not a good parameter name, better name is welcome.\r\n\r\n

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

How about it?\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be possible edit this PR to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] use `@software{...`, even though it's may still be treated as `@misc` by BibLaTeX\r\n- [ ] add a DOI through https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/\r\n- [ ] point [`Reference Paper`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet#reference-paper) to this file\r\n\r\nI'm leaving out the rest of the checklist from the PR template, because this PR does not add or change actual code.","created_at":"2018-01-05T07:52:06Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T23:02:29Z","closed_at":"2018-03-20T23:02:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6de570abce8c0671b0d3b9b68cefe537b59ed5df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/382afde1b175669ff42ebbf8af788b016490579b","head":{"label":"katrinleinweber:master","ref":"master","sha":"382afde1b175669ff42ebbf8af788b016490579b","user":{"login":"katrinleinweber","id":9948149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDgxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9948149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber","html_url":"https://github.com/katrinleinweber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"df9f79ae5e265e28ceecab3c58828f3a84769eb4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n@marcoabreu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-04T21:46:14Z","updated_at":"2018-01-04T21:52:06Z","closed_at":"2018-01-04T21:52:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a115556a798eafa57e46e50054026040218923f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bbc79bdf993ecfb0b2491c9eaa5ce3e33cc9fb16","head":{"label":"apache:szha-patch-1","ref":"szha-patch-1","sha":"bbc79bdf993ecfb0b2491c9eaa5ce3e33cc9fb16","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n- Adds an optional argument `axis` to `SequenceLast`, `SequenceMask` and `SequenceReverse`. The default is `axis=0`. Values for `axis=1` and `axis=0` are implemented for `SequenceLast` and `SequenceMask`. \r\n- Rigorous tests are added for all sequence ops. \r\n- Bug in `SequenceMask` was fixed (incorrect behaviour for `kAddTo`).\r\n- Performance improvements: `SequenceLast` avoids any movement of data to the CPU, and uses a much faster implementation similar to `pick`. `SequenceMask` now supports inplace.\r\n\r\nAxis support will be added to `SequenceReverse` in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [x] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to

Description ##\r\nThis PR is trying to fix runtime errors when running benchmark_score.py on CPU machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nUnder example/image-classification/symbols:\r\n1. vgg.py, original implementation can't run preperly under Python3.x, as \"has_key\" method not supported by Python3 anymore;\r\n2. google.py, on CPU platform, the input to the last layer (7x7 avg pooling is 6x6, and therefore a runtime error will be triggered, I avoid this issue by add a (1,1) pad with the avg pooling.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-04T10:18:17Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T13:07:31Z","closed_at":"2018-02-13T13:07:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7aec242632c53ca081e83ac403bc3f6ab79912fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/74a37d3270e6498db0298b59d692221162e5d65a","head":{"label":"juliusshufan:cnn-model-fix","ref":"cnn-model-fix","sha":"74a37d3270e6498db0298b59d692221162e5d65a","user":{"login":"juliusshufan","id":33112206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTEyMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33112206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan","html_url":"https://github.com/juliusshufan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliusshufan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2df29ccc119909f027e6a8275bab71f801afa682","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nGPU rand state was not allocated on the right device, which can cause 'illegal memory access' when running with multi-GPUs.\r\n\r\nIt's line 281 in `src/resource.cc` causes the problem.\r\n\r\nCan we do test on multi-gpu? I mean, can I assume our CI instances have multi-gpu enabled?\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n* Fix gpu rand state allocation problem\r\n* readability:

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix typo for assert messages.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-02T04:50:21Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T07:08:34Z","closed_at":"2018-01-02T07:08:34Z","merged_at":"2018-01-02T07:08:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f10bd4e1114e34485b5114d07126e85ea43a320","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9277/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9277/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9277/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/2b19552410b17f7a14d76d2e42c81652693d4910","head":{"label":"mwbyeon:fix_typo","ref":"fix_typo","sha":"2b19552410b17f7a14d76d2e42c81652693d4910","user":{"login":"mwbyeon","id":6959765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NTk3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6959765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon","html_url":"https://github.com/mwbyeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwbyeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"79cb705d3e7e7daa5315e57d437c24af0bb299b0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nAdded the C++ implementation of the Signum optimizer. \r\n\r\nBernstein, Wang, Azizzadenesheli and Anandkumar (2017) \"The Signum optimiser: a theory of momentum in quantised stochastic optimisation\" \r\n[Link to pdf](https://jeremybernste.in/projects/amazon/signum.pdf)\r\n\r\nWhat's also included is the implementation of an option to do the alternative version of weight decay regularization due to Loshchilov and Hutter via option 'wd_lh'.\r\n\"Fixing Weight Decay Regularization in Adam\"\r\n[Link to arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added the Signum optimizer to mxnet's list of optimizers \r\n- [x] A special case is SignSGD optimizer, a stand-alone implementation whenever \"momentum\" is set to 0.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- TODO1: add sparse matrix support for this optimizer\r\n- TODO2: Take advantage of the 1-bit gradient compression interpretation of SignSGD and Signum.\r\n- TODO3: Adding 'wd_lh' support for Adam and other adaptive gradient optimizers.

Description ##\r\nAfter compiling from the source, the c++ header files are spread among various directories. I have to pick them out and copy them to my /usr/local/include one by one.\r\n\r\nI pull the repository to my computer with git, then copy make/config.mk to the upper directory and modify some options in the /make/config.mk file. \r\n```\r\n    $ cd mxnet\r\n    $ cp -riv make/config.mk ./\r\n```\r\nThen I compile with make:\r\n```\r\n    $ make\r\n```\r\nafter a few hours, the compilation is done. I copied the shared and static libs to my default lib directory, and copied the header files to my default include:\r\n```\r\n    $ cp lib/* /usr/local/lib\r\n    $ cp include/ /usr/local/include\r\n```\r\nThen I go to the c++ example directory and download the example data:\r\n```\r\n    $ cd cpp-package/example\r\n    $ ./get_mnist.sh\r\n```\r\nI typed the example program given in the page https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/c++/basics.html\r\n\r\nbut my g++ complains that no header files found:\r\n```\r\nfatal error: mxnet-cpp/MxNetCpp.h: No such file or directory\r\n #include<mxnet-cpp/MxNetCpp.h>\r\n```\r\nI found it in the directory '/home/coin/build/mxnet/cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp' and I copied it to my /usr/local/include, and then recompile the example, another header file missing error appears:\r\n```\r\n fatal error: nnvm/c_api.h: No such file or directory\r\n #include \"nnvm/c_api.h\"\r\n```\r\nAfter that I spent quite a few minutes to pick the required header files one by one from the directories to my include paths, such as the /home/coin/build/mxnet/dmlc-core/include/dmlc/ and  /home/coin/build/mxnet/nnvm/include/nnvm or so.\r\n\r\nDo you have any measures to generate the c++ api header files in a single folder and allow me to copy it to my include directory with one clean effort? Or did I misunderstand your intention of the c++ api?\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-26T07:42:17Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T20:30:56Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T20:30:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"comm

Description ##\r\n\r\n[WIP] NCE Loss in Gluon\r\n\r\n- [x] Add sampling method and its example.\r\n- [x] Add test for AliasMethodSampler.\r\n- [x] Compare speed of AliasMethodSampler in Numpy, NDArray, etc.\r\n- [ ] Add NCELoss in gluon.loss\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Example in using `AliasMethodSampler`\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nFor 1D convolutions, the Convolution and Deconvolution operations currently bypass cudnn in favor of an approach that involves custom im2col-kernel and cublas-GEMM calls.  These calls occur for each element of a batch of inputs, and so result in poor GPU efficiency and large kernel launch overhead.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables cudnn handling of batched 1D convolutions by mapping them to their equivalent 2D representation (adding a missing height dimension of size 1 for data and filter tensors).  On a Sockeye model using the ConvolutionBlock class with bucket sizes up to 80, the performance gain of this PR was measured as 2X or greater.  Experiments on Volta on a model that casts the convolution I/Os to fp16 showed a 3.5X speed-up.\r\n\r\nTest coverage of 1D convolutions/deconvolutions is expanded.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-23T00:58:51Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T18:47:42Z","closed_at":"2018-01-02T18:47:41Z","merged_at":"2018-01-02T18:47:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b99b25e5f6ab3a20c7bcf4821a6af0a1a95f823","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9184/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9184/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9184/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1be3e8c8a553a31e4ebc018a3f43ebcac7172955","head":{"label":"DickJC123:1D_conv_with_cudnn","ref":"1D_conv_with_cudnn","sha":"1be3e8c8a553a31e4ebc018a3f43ebcac7172955","user":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86116214,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjExNjIxNA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"DickJC123/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DickJC123","id":1703397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123","html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DickJC123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DickJC123/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with

Description ##\r\nThis should not be merged. This change is for my local repo to set up a test.\r\nThis test does training on latest version of MXNet and run the inference on old version of MXNet. This way we basically make sure that if we break anything in new release. If so we can add that in release notes. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-22T00:36:24Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T19:31:22Z","closed_at":"2018-01-12T19:31:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8247c6b54ab6737f53c65004c3da021339cb5d92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4e4cab70588d59473c407484e63ae037085f2848","head":{"label":"goswamig:apache_master","ref":"apache_master","sha":"4e4cab70588d59473c407484e63ae037085f2848","user":{"login":"goswamig","id":3092152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTIxNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3092152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig","html_url":"https://github.com/goswamig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goswamig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c6cdf514767ffa7a57d4aae33c634bf4caca0004","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\nDependencies listed in python setup.py did not have version numbers. It was always pulling the latest available version. This was causing a non-deterministic (untested) versions of dependencies like \"Numpy\" to be installed when users were building from source.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of the users tried to checkout v0.12.1 and build from source, but it installed numpy v1.14.0.rc1 causing unknown issues and failures.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, capping on the known tested versions of the dependencies.\r\n\r\n@szha - Can you please review this PR? Also, I am guessing Pip packages are capped with known dependency versions rather than taking latest.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n- [X] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nAdd gluon example for embedding learning.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [v] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [v] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [v] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [v] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [v] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n - Add embedding learning example.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- More datasets to come

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds a tutorial for distributed training.\r\nIt covers\r\n\r\n- how distributed training works\r\n- setting up a cluster\r\n- how to run distributed training using launch.py and different options it supports\r\n- how to run distributed training without launch.py\r\n- related environment variables\r\n\r\nDirect link:\r\n[docs/faq/distributed_training.md](https://github.com/rahul003/mxnet/blob/dist-pr2/docs/faq/distributed_training.md)\r\n\r\nI split the old PR to separate doc change and code change.\r\nDoc change is in this PR.\r\nThe example referred to in this tutorial requires this [PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9151) to go in\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nN/A Doc changes only\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Removed old section in multi_devices.md to a new page for distributed_training because it is long\r\n\r\n### Comments ###\r\n- The example this refers to requires this [PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9151) to be merged. The reason for this is that the example currently uses a python path insert to fetch a file from tests/ folder. This causes few problems\r\n    1. It requires the user to have the whole mxnet repository, with the directory structure intact\r\n    2. It means the user can't run the example standalone\r\n    3. For distributed training this means we would have to synchronize the whole mxnet directory across all machines. \r\n    This is unnecessary and bad user experience

Description ##\r\nSome examples insert a folder to the python path to fetch a file from `tests/` folder. This causes few problems\r\n    1. It requires the user to have the whole mxnet repository, with the directory structure intact\r\n    2. It means the user can't run the example standalone\r\n    3. For distributed training this means we would have to synchronize the whole mxnet directory across all machines. \r\nThis is unnecessary and inconvenient for the user.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Moves get_mnist_pkl, get_mnist_ubyte, get_mnist_iterator from tests folder to mxnet.test_utils\r\n- [x] Adds support to functions that generate data iterators for partitioning of datasets so that different workers in distributed training can use different parts of the dataset.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-20T03:02:45Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T08:38:22Z","closed_at":"2018-01-15T20:47:31Z","merged_at":"2018-01-15T20:47:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"11cb609002fc202f74fcaadcde76e1efefa17f05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9151/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9151/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9151/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/40ee98eeb759e1789d543bbae63a5d70886baa27","head":{"label":"rahul003:rm-pythonpath","ref":"rm-pythonpath","sha":"40ee98eeb759e1789d543bbae63a5d70886baa27","user":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96937059,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjkzNzA1OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"rahul003/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add warning,

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [v] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [v] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-19T12:13:42Z","updated_at":"2017-12-22T21:44:55Z","closed_at":"2017-12-22T21:44:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d362557da551435515a4c70c9f17b56d56fa4d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d509d089c03512de84ccc4a36e88f0d8a37f467d","head":{"label":"ngongon:master","ref":"master","sha":"d509d089c03512de84ccc4a36e88f0d8a37f467d","user":{"login":"ngongon","id":26247535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjQ3NTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26247535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon","html_url":"https://github.com/ngongon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngongon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"500ed5f5def52264f2232b0c83964ed071593afe","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [v] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [v] To the my best

lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds a tutorial for distributed training. \r\nIt covers \r\n- how distributed training works\r\n- setting up a cluster\r\n- how to run distributed training using launch.py and different options it supports\r\n- how to run distributed training without launch.py\r\n- related environment variables\r\n\r\nDirect link: \r\n[docs/how_to/distributed_training.md](https://github.com/rahul003/mxnet/blob/dist-pr/docs/how_to/distributed_training.md) \r\n\r\nFeedback welcome. \r\nPlease let me know if I should add more info about something.\r\n\r\n@aaronmarkham @eric-haibin-lin @madjam \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Adds the tutorial (docs/how_to/distributed_training.md)\r\n- [x] Removed python path inserts for some examples so that they can run by themselves. This is important because otherwise for distributed training we would have to copy the entire mxnet folder across all machines\r\n- [x] Removed duplicated get_mnist and get_mnist_iterator functions by moving them to mxnet.test_utils

Description ##\r\nAdd the tests required in testing https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9119\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add mean_check, var_check, chi_square_check APIs for testing random generators\r\n- [x] Add tests for all the current supported random generators.\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\n  - This example was not compatible with python3. I made necessary changes. \r\n  - I also updated the README with the Pre-reqs I needed to make the example work on the CONDA AMI (mxnet_p36/mxnet_p27 envs)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Some changes to atari_game.py to make it compatible with both python2 and python3.\r\n- [x] Some changes to base.py to make it compatible with python2 and python3.\r\n- [x] Updated README\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n  - I have tested on the Deep Learning AMI with Conda (Ubuntu) (ami-405ade3a)\r\n  - I fixed it such that it works with both python 3.x and python 2.x\r\n  - I have not verified the accuracy or validity of results.\r\n  - I have not tested on Mac OS\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-19T00:36:24Z","updated_at":"2017-12-19T05:35:49Z","closed_at":"2017-12-19T05:35:49Z","merged_at":"2017-12-19T05:35:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1d3e97c0c35dbbea325a36171c94b1005a8fbeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/260a0885addd5a506495a725254a21b6f06580f5","head":{"label":"mbaijal:fix_example_dqn","ref":"fix_example_dqn","sha":"260a0885addd5a506495a725254a21b6f06580f5","user":{"login":"mbaijal","id":30911248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTExMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30911248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100059674,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDAwNTk2NzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"mbaijal/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbaijal","id":30911248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTExMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30911248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThe test scripts contain sys.path() that insert relative PYTHONPATH. This makes the examples less portable.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [y] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [y] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

(`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThe current implement for random sampler (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8179) raises a new (random) seed every time it starts to generate a random number, which is incorrect. @asmushetzel\r\n\r\nAlthough `std::mt19937` seems to work with this approach, samplers with `curand` generate low-quality of randomness and probably makes these numbers correlated.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I noticed training with `SGLD` collapses to low ACC (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/8958). Secondly, @sxjscience has written new test cases for random sampler, using mean/var/chi square test, non of them passes with the current implement.\r\n\r\nAccording to [Nvidia document for kernel random API](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/curand/device-api-overview.html), we need to maintain global seeds and reuse them. Moreover, the random state is not thread-safe.\r\n\r\nThe implement here maintains a fixed number of global random states and can be access through `Resource`. In case it is accessed by multiple GPU streams, (default) `4` independent GPU generators are created in global `Resource`.\r\n\r\nI tested `example/bayesian-methods` and now it converges to reasonable results. It should pass @sxjscience 's new test cases as well.\r\n\r\nThe memory usage and speed barely changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage: Waiting for @sxjscience 's test cases\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Global seeds for GPU & CPU sampler.\r\n- [x] Fix `SGLD` optimizer arguments.","created_at":"2017-12-18T08:02:48Z","updated_at":"2017-12-29T08:45:47Z","closed_at":"2017-12-28T20:27:26Z","merged_at":"2017-12-28T20:27:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"34a51959bd2bc21c6cfa93f5fe0e079ef5268261","assignee":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":206159502,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDYxNTk1MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9119/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9119/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9119/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3c1608abdb24143fb64f1a1b6a6c8c54e330ec53","head":{"label":"yzhliu:fix-rnd","ref":"fix-rnd","sha":"3c1608abdb24143fb64f1a1b6a6c8c54e330ec53","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47767518,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Nzc2NzUxOA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"yzhliu/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nadded SELU and ELU activation functions as recommended on this thread https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8422\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x]  Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-17T12:15:04Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T10:40:30Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T04:52:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1cb70c287216950fc08bc1ba56218df6c27211ee","assignee":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d5377f90f4a508d8734511c5a4d0255b74bfdcdc","head":{"label":"anjishnu:master","ref":"master","sha":"d5377f90f4a508d8734511c5a4d0255b74bfdcdc","user":{"login":"anjishnu","id":2019824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk4MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2019824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu","html_url":"https://github.com/anjishnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anjishnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}",

for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with

Description ##\r\nSome changes to numpy_ops examples:\r\n- Use module API instead of the deprecated model API\r\n- Reduce the number of epochs to 10 (which is sufficient)\r\n- Use CPU by default.
