is an example/RFC for a usecase mentioned at the recent TVM conference - specifically, allowing single-file deployment of TVM models ab initio, without having the predeploy the TVM runtime. This is done by building a single \"bundled\" shared object, prebaking the graph/params into this shared object, and exposing the user-visible functions to be invoked via `dlopen`/`dlsym`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how generally useful this is, but I thought I'd put it up in case folks have thoughts on better ways to achieve the main goal, etc.\r\n\r\n(the `README.md` is embedded below):\r\n\r\nHow to Bundle TVM Modules\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nThis folder contains an example on how to bundle a TVM module (with the required\r\ninterpreter runtime modules such as `runtime::GraphRuntime`, the graph JSON, and\r\nthe params) into a single, self-contained shared object (`bundle.so`) which\r\nexposes a C API wrapping the appropriate `runtime::GraphRuntime` instance.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for cases where we'd like to avoid deploying the TVM runtime\r\ncomponents to the target host in advance - instead, we simply deploy the bundled\r\nshared-object to the host, which embeds both the model and the runtime\r\ncomponents. The bundle should only depend on libc/libc++.\r\n\r\nIt also contains an example code to load this shared object and invoke the\r\npackaged TVM model instance.\r\n\r\nType the following command to run the sample code under the current folder,\r\nafter building TVM first.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake demo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will:\r\n\r\n- Download the mobilenet0.25 model from the MXNet Gluon Model Zoo\r\n- Compile the model with NNVM\r\n- Build a `bundle.so` shared object containing the model specification and parameters\r\n- Build a `demo` executable that `dlopen`'s `bundle.so`, instantiates the\r\n  contained graph runtime, and invokes the run function on a random

PR introduces a couple of improvements for simplifying Reduce nodes:\r\n- If the reduction has no axes, it is completely removed by `Simplify`.\r\n- Information about ranges of itervars is now propagated by default (this is consistent with the behavior of the simplifier inherited from halide which e.g. uses information from conditions of selects). Since vranges are passed manually in some places, we check if the ranges are the same, and if they are not, throw an exception, since this is most probably a mistake.\r\n- Add a function `SimplifyCombiner` which simplifies only the combiner of a given reduction node. It may also remove elements of the tuple which are not necessary in this reduction. This transformation is important for my autodiff implementation.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @derisavi Please

the issue in https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/relay-duplicated-maxpool-in-multiple-branches/1235/12.\r\n\r\nWe need to memorize results of backward transformation of FoldScaleAxis. If nodes in multiple branches are rewritten, the common parent will be transformed multiple times, which results in duplicated nodes if the parent of the parent changes.\r\n\r\nNote that the test case here can pass even without this patch. This is a limitation of `AlphaEqual`. We cannot detect whether the two `g(expr)` in `f(g(expr), g(expr))` is duplicated (evaluated two times).\r\n\r\nThe below two functions are alpha-equal.\r\n\r\nBefore this patch:\r\n```\r\nfn (%x:

noticed recently that I encountered several opaque LLVM errors during code generation, particularly around vectorized conditional statements. To debug these, I ended up running the LLVM verifier on the generated code (which immediately identifier the relevant bugs in the IR generation process, around Select + Ramps), so I thought this would be a useful check to have on the generated code.\r\n\r\nI've only tried this on the CPU backend, so I'm not sure what the state of the verifier is on other backends, but presumably continuous build would reveal any glaring issues.\r\n\r\nFor a sample of what kind of things are checked, see http://llvm.org/doxygen/Verifier_8cpp_source.html, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```.cpp\r\n // This file defines the function verifier interface, that can be used for some\r\n // sanity checking of input to the system.\r\n //\r\n // Note that this does not provide full `Java style' security and verifications,\r\n // instead it just tries to ensure that code is well-formed.\r\n //\r\n //  * Both of a binary operator's parameters are of the same type\r\n //  * Verify that the indices of mem access instructions match other operands\r\n //  * Verify that arithmetic and other things are only performed on first-class\r\n //    types.  Verify that shifts & logicals only happen on integrals f.e.\r\n //  * All of the constants in a switch statement are of the correct type\r\n //  * The code is in valid SSA form\r\n //  * It should be illegal to put a label into any other type (like a structure)\r\n //    or to return one. [except constant arrays!]\r\n //  * Only phi nodes can be self referential: 'add i32 %0, %0 ; <int>:0' is bad\r\n //  * PHI nodes must have an entry for each predecessor, with no extras.\r\n //  * PHI nodes must be the first thing in a basic block, all grouped together\r\n //  * PHI nodes must have at least one entry\r\n //  * All basic blocks should only end with terminator insts, not contain them\r\n //  * The entry node to a function must not have predecessors\r\n //  * All Instructions must be embedded into a basic block\r\n //  * Functions cannot take a void-typed parameter\r\n //  * Verify that a function's argument list agrees with it's declared type.\r\n //  * It is illegal to specify a name for a void value.\r\n //  * It is illegal to have a internal global value with no initializer\r\n //  * It is illegal to have a ret instruction that returns a value that does not\r\n //    agree with the function return value type.\r\n //  * Function call argument types match the function prototype\r\n //  * A landing pad is defined by a landingpad instruction, and can be jumped to\r\n //    only by the unwind edge of an invoke instruction.\r\n //  * A landingpad instruction must be the first non-PHI instruction in the\r\n //    block.\r\n //  * Landingpad instructions must be in a function with a personality function.\r\n //  * All other things that are tested by asserts spread about the code...\r\n //\r\n

change adds greater support for type unification to Relay. In particular, it allows for handling cases that require recursing down the type ASTs. E.g., `Unify(Tuple(?a, ?b), Tuple(Tensor(s, bt), Tensor(s, bt)))` should be able to conclude that the unified type is `Tuple(Tensor(s, bt), Tensor(s, bt))` and that `Unify(Tuple(?a, ?b), Tuple(?c, ?d))` implies `?a = ?c` and `?b = ?d`.\r\n\r\nThe main concern is ensuring that if we have a type variable nested inside another type, then an update to that type variable should result in re-running all relations where that type variable appears, _including those where that type variable is nested inside another type_. That was the main source of complexity in these changes.\r\n\r\n(Note to reviewers: It would be very good to ensure that this unifier does not unnecessarily add relations to the queue and thus make the solver do unnecessary work. I do not believe that it does, though.)\r\n\r\nPlease review as to whether this is the direction we want to take, @jroesch, @tqchen, and others\r\n\r\nOutline of Relay's Type Checking and Inference Implementation\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of reviewers and future work on Relay's type system implementation, I will give a high-level outline of how type checking and inference work in Relay.\r\n\r\nTypes are actually inferred during the process of type checking, which runs in two stages:\r\n1. Constraint generation\r\n2. Constraint solving\r\n\r\nExplanation of Constraints on Types\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBy \"constraints,\" we mean constraints on the possible types permitted for a given term. For example, if a variable `v` appears in a tuple projection `v.1`, we would like to be able to express the constraint that `v` must have a tuple type with at least two members. Later, in the constraint solving phase, we would fill in the *specific* tuple type that `v` must have.\r\n\r\nHandling type inference requires filling in types for terms whose types have been omitted, as in functions where parameter or return types have been omitted or `let` bindings where the variable is not annotated with a type. In these cases, those terms are given *incomplete types* (known as type variables or type holes in the programming languages literature), to be filled in during the constraint solving phase.\r\n\r\n### Unification\r\n\r\nThe most common constraint employed is the main subject of this PR, namely *unification*: the constraint that two types must be structurally equal. (For example, unifying two tuple types requires ensuring that the corresponding members of the tuples can be unified.) Very many type-checking rules require unification: for example, type-checking a function call requires ensuring that the types of the arguments to the call match the types expected for function arguments, so the types of the call arguments will be unified with the function's expected argument types.\r\n\r\nIncomplete types require special handling during unification, which is where most of the complexity in the implementation here emerges. Namely, if an incomplete type is unified with another incomplete type, that means both those incomplete types must eventually resolve to the same type. So, if incomplete type `?a` and `?b` are unified and then `?b` is later unified with a type `Tensor[(10, 10), float32]`, all occurrences of both `?a` and `?b` must be equal to `Tensor[(10, 10), float32]`.\r\n\r\nUnification for incomplete types is thus handled via a union-find (UF) data structure, where incomplete types are nodes in the UF tree. For unifying incomplete types with concrete types, we must also keep a mapping of incomplete types to concrete types: if an incomplete type is unified with a concrete type, we say it resolves to that concrete type.\r\n\r\nThere is one more complication, which is that recursive unification is not permitted. E.g., `Unify(?a, (?a, ?b))` is invalid because there is no concrete type that is a tuple containing itself as one member. Thus, we must check for such recursion when unifying incomplete types and reject it (this is called an \"occurs check\" in the PL literature, since it checks whether a type variable occurs inside another type).\r\n\r\nWe can thus outline the algorithm for unifying two types `t1` and `t2` (`Unify(t1, t2)`) as follows:\r\n1. If `t1` and `t2` are both incomplete types, find `r1` and `r2`, their respective UF roots. If `r1` is the same as `r2`, there is no more work to do. Otherwise, we may unify `r1` and `r2` in the UF tree. If one of `r1` and `r2` has a resolved (concrete) type and the other doesn't, set the resolved type of the new UF root to that resolved type; if both have a resolved type (call them `c1` and `c2`), set the resolved type of the new UF root to `Unify(c1, c2)`. Return the resolved type of the new UF root (or the UF root itself if there was no resolved type).\r\n2. If one of `t1` and `t2` is an incomplete type and the other is concrete (WLOG, assume that `t1` is incomplete and `t2` is concrete), obtain the UF root of `t1`, `r1`. Next perform an occurs check in `t2` for `r1` (the occurs check simply traverses `t2`'s AST and for each incomplete type encountered, checks whether its UF root is equal to `r1`); reject if there is an occurrence. If `r1` does not have a resolved type, set its resolved type to `t2` and return `t2`. If `r1` has a resolved type `c1`, set `r1`'s resolved type to `Unify(c1, t2)` and return the final resolved type.\r\n3. If neither `t1` nor `t2` is an incomplete type, unify them by recursing down their ASTs. If `t1` and `t2` fail to match at any point of their AST (e.g., if `t1` is a tuple type and `t2` is a function type), reject the unification. For types that do not contain nested types (e.g., tensor types), reject if they are not equal and return the type if they are equal. Otherwise, unify all subtrees of the two types and return the unified type.\r\n\r\nBecause union-find with path compression is very asymptotically efficient, unification takes time approximately linear in the size of the type ASTs being unified.\r\n\r\n### Explicit Type Relations\r\n\r\nThe other constraints typically generated in Relay are explicit type relations on functions. Type relations are typically associated with Relay operators (see the developer tutorial on adding operators, https://docs.tvm.ai/dev/relay_add_op.html, for some discussion). In their current implementation, they take the argument and return types to a Relay function and define a procedure (i.e., a function in C++) that checks if the constraint holds. The procedures may perform arbitrary checks and can update any shape variables or incomplete types within the types passed to them.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `Identity` relation simply unifies the types passed to it and is satisfied if unifying the types succeeds. The `Broadcast` relation is satisfied if all the types passed to it are tuple types and the shape of the function return type is the broadcast of the argument types' shapes.\r\n\r\nNote that because it is possible for type relations to be given incomplete types or types that contain nested incomplete types as arguments, the queue of type relations must be appropriately updated as those incomplete types are unified and resolved. In order to track these updates, each type in the program keeps a list of all the type relations in which it appears as an argument (we can call this list a \"trigger list\"), which is also propagated to every sub-tree of that type's AST. When two types are unified, the final unified type will combine the trigger lists of the two argument types and any unresolved relation in the two trigger lists will be put on the queue of relations, as there is now new information that may allow that relation to be resolved.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we have a tuple type `(?a, ?b)` that is given as an argument to relation `R1`, then `R1` is in the trigger lists of `(?a, ?b)`, `?a`, and `?b`. If `?a` is unified with another type and `R1` is not yet solved, `R1` will be put back on the queue of relations because updating `?a` give new information.\r\n\r\nWhen adding a type relation, it takes time linear in the size of each argument type AST to propagate that type relation to the trigger list of each argument type. When unifying two types, it takes time linear in the size of the types' trigger lists to iterate through the trigger lists and determine whether a relation needs to be put back on the queue. While the linear performance times here can quickly add up, the number of explicit relations in any given program will typically be quite small and will only apply to a few of the types in the program, so this is not expected to be a threat to performance.\r\n\r\nConstraint Generation\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe constraint generation phase of type checking is implemented by recursing down the AST of a program and adding new type constraints based on the type-checking rules for each AST node. Without listing out the rules for each node, this procedure consists primarily of the following:\r\n\r\n* Keep a map of terms to types.\r\n* For local variables bound in a `let` expression or function argument, if the type annotation is omitted, set it to a fresh incomplete type. Similarly, if a return type to a function is not annotated, treat it as having an incomplete type for the return type.\r\n* For operators and functions that feature explicit type relations, add the relation to a queue for the constraint solving phase.\r\n* Unify types of terms everywhere they are expected to match. For example, if there is a call to a function in the program, the type of the call should be unified with the return type of the function and the type of each call argument should be unified with the corresponding function parameter types.\r\n\r\nThis phase of type checking should not do very much for each AST node besides adding type relations to a queue or adding more unification constraints and should only visit each AST node once, so it should be approximately linear in the size of the program AST.\r\n\r\nConstraint Solving\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe second phase of type checking requires solving constraints. In the case of unification constraints, solving is simple: for each type `t`, resolve it by recursing down its AST and replacing each incomplete type with the concrete resolved type of its root in the UF tree.\r\n\r\nExplicit type relations currently take somewhat of an *ad hoc* approach: There is a queue of relations kept from the generation phase. For each relation in the queue, call its updater function. If the relation holds and all types passed to the relation are fully concrete, dequeue the relation; it is solved. If a relation returns false, there is a type checking error. Otherwise, if incomplete types remain, add the relation back to the queue. Keep iterating through the queue until all relations are solved or a fixpoint is reached (i.e., no types are changing). A fixpoint may either mean there is an error (impossible constraint to satisfy) or that there is not enough information given (more annotations may be necessary).\r\n\r\nNote that resolution of incomplete types should be performed *after* solving all type relations, since the relations may update incomplete types (i.e., add more unification constraints).\r\n\r\nThe complexity of this phase is difficult to classify, since relations may perform arbitrary operations. It is certainly possible to imagine constructing very entangled queues of interdependent relations that would have poor performance, but in practice, the relations used for most operators in Relay have simple constraints that do not take many iterations of the queue to fully resolve.\r\n\r\nRemaining Issue\r\n------------------\r\nBound type variables don't fit into the above story. That will take some additional design work (see below discussion); we will address it later.","created_at":"2018-11-29T02:54:26Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T18:38:11Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T17:18:46Z","merged_at":"2019-01-15T17:18:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0a20ad4a5b6f007f7182f12958e061c873a6396","assignee":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:
