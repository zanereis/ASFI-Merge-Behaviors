What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to improve the PySpark API reference page to be more readable,\r\n\r\nSo far, the PySpark documentation especially [\"Spark SQL\" part](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql.html#) is not-well organized so it's a bit uncomfortable to be read as below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"260\" alt=\"Screen

document readability will also improve the usability for PySpark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, now the documentation is categorized by its class or their own purpose more clearly as below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"270\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-24 at 1 50 23 PM\"

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up the `spark.rpc.numRetries` and `spark.rpc.retry.wait` configs, both of which are unused.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-19450 / #16790 in Spark 2.2.0, both of these configurations are unused and setting them has no effect. Marking the configs as deprecated and cleaning them up from the docs helps to avoid user confusion.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this cleanup slightly improves the performance of constructing `RpcEndpointRef`s because it removes two unused fields that were initialized by reading the deprecated configs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-24T00:00:52Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T04:58:48Z","closed_at":"2022-05-24T04:58:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43630bdb9658b41e38a84790bffd7d2233d0b305","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRe-optimize partitions in Distribution and Ordering if numPartitions is not specified.\r\n\r\nSupport both strictly required distribution and best effort distribution. For best effort distribution, if user doesn't request a specific number of partitions, Spark will split skewed partitions and coalesce small partitions (`RebalancePartitions` will be used and  both `OptimizeSkewInRebalancePartitions` and `CoalesceShufflePartitions` will be applied). For strictly required distribution, if user doesn't request a specific number of partitions, Spark will coalesce small partitions but will NOT split skewed partitions(`RepartitionByExpression(distribution, query, None)` will be used and `CoalesceShufflePartitions` will be applied).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\noptimization\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn interface `RequiresDistributionAndOrdering`, a new API `distributionStrictlyRequired()` will be added to tell if the distribution required by this write is strictly required or best effort only\r\n```\r\ndefault boolean distributionStrictlyRequired() { return true; }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting and new

Also verified that the pattern matching change works by running the test for 100 iterations few times.\r\n```\r\n[info] RateStreamProviderSuite:\r\n15:37:58.700 WARN

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nError messages in the JSON file should not contain newline characters; newlines are delineated as different elements in the array.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Checks that newline characters do not exist, and improves the formatting of the JSON file so that each array element is on a new line\r\n- Checks that messages are trimmed, and improves the formatting of the JSON file by adding spaces after all newlines and between error class messages/subclass messages in the code\r\n- Introduces an environment variable to generate a formatted file: `SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproves the readability of the error message JSON file.\r\n\r\n### Does

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `org.apache.orc.Reader.getSchema` instead of `org.apache.orc.Reader.getTypes` in `SparkOrcNewRecordReader`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`getTypes` was deprecated. This is the only usage in Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/orc/blob/main/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/Reader.java#L144\r\n```java\r\n  /**\r\n   * Get the list of types contained in the file. The root type is the first\r\n   * type in the list.\r\n   * @return the list of flattened types\r\n   * @deprecated use getSchema instead\r\n   * @since 1.1.0\r\n   */\r\n  List<OrcProto.Type> getTypes();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, AS-IS implementation is only a slow-wrapper.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/orc/blob/1e2962064b209f1b00188877f08d4226da85c640/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/impl/ReaderImpl.java#L259-L262\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public List<OrcProto.Type> getTypes() {\r\n    return OrcUtils.getOrcTypes(schema);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/orc/blob/1e2962064b209f1b00188877f08d4226da85c640/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/OrcUtils.java#L108-L112\r\n```java\r\n  public static List<OrcProto.Type> getOrcTypes(TypeDescription typeDescr) {\r\n    List<OrcProto.Type> result = new ArrayList<>();\r\n    appendOrcTypes(result, typeDescr);\r\n    return result;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to improve errors of the following error classes:\r\n1. NON_PARTITION_COLUMN - `a non-partition column name` -> `the non-partition column`\r\n2. UNSUPPORTED_SAVE_MODE - `a not existent path` -> `a non existent path`.\r\n3. INVALID_FIELD_NAME. Quote ids to follow the rules https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36621.\r\n4. FAILED_SET_ORIGINAL_PERMISSION_BACK. It is renamed to FAILED_PERMISSION_RESET_ORIGINAL.\r\n5. NON_LITERAL_PIVOT_VALUES - Wrap error's expression by double quotes. The PR adds new helper method `toSQLExpr()` for that.\r\n6. CAST_INVALID_INPUT - Add the recommendation: `... Correct the syntax for the value before casting it, or change the type to one appropriate for the value.`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by making error message more clear.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsDSv2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32513 and fixes an issue introduced by that patch.\r\n\r\nCommandResultExec is supposed to return `UnsafeRow` records in all of the `executeXYZ` methods but `executeCollect` was left out which causes issues like this one: \r\n```\r\nError in SQL statement: ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GenericInternalRow \r\ncannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.UnsafeRow\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to return `unsafeRows` instead of `rows` in `executeCollect` similar to other methods in the class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in CommandResultExec.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test to check the return type of all commands.","created_at":"2022-05-23T05:52:18Z","updated_at":"2022-06-29T21:25:51Z","closed_at":"2022-05-23T08:59:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc0a787b287bd5c3fb2cc0ec7046e5e56c0df498","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c3d7d4419d327438a6f2d5e220f4c46c96721ab","head":{"label":"sadikovi:fix-command-exec","ref":"fix-command-exec","sha":"1c3d7d4419d327438a6f2d5e220f4c46c96721ab","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSwitch decimal type divide from\r\n```\r\ntoJavaBigDecimal.divide(that.toJavaBigDecimal, MATH_CONTEXT)\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\ntoJavaBigDecimal.divide(that.toJavaBigDecimal, DecimalType.MAX_SCALE, MATH_CONTEXT.getRoundingMode)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference is that [`preferredScale !=

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently we can do subexpression elimination for conditional expressions when the subexpression is common across all `branchGroups`. In fact, we can farther improve this when there are common expressions between `alwaysEvaluatedInputs` and `branchGroups`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTake the following case as an example\r\n```\r\nIF(IsNull(a), b, KnowNotNull(a))\r\n```\r\n`a` **may miss subexpression elimination chances** since it is not the common expression between all `branchGroups`, but it's **safe** to evaluate `a` as common subexpression and eagerly execute it since it's part of the prediction, which will always be executed. If `a` is a time-expensive expression, we may waste time on running it.\r\n\r\nThis kind of expressions are common when we do `sum` on decimal type because of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29026\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/291d155b3c514f8b590a6b078f7efd42a30e67f0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/aggregate/Sum.scala#L125\r\n\r\nMany queries on TPC-DS has positive improvement.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRewrite table location to absolute location based on database location. For example:\r\n```\r\nTable location: /user/hive/warehouse/db_spark_39203.db/t1\r\nDatabase location: viewfs://clusterA/user/hive/warehouse/db_spark_39203.db/\r\n```\r\nThe current table location is: `viewfs://clusterA/user/hive/warehouse/db_spark_39203.db/t1`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe old Spark version(before SPARK-19257) will not use absolute path when using the following SQL create table:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE DB_SPARK_39203.t6(id int)\r\nUSING parquet\r\nOPTIONS (\r\n  path '/user/hive/warehouse/db_spark_39203.db/t1'\r\n);\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"551\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5399861/170249177-dded6f23-2a59-4d08-a410-df4c975693b7.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue makes Spark can't read tables across cluster. For example:\r\nHive, Spark 2.1 and HDFS 1 on cluster A.\r\nSpark 3.0 and HDFS 2 on cluster B.\r\n\r\nThe other create table command and latest spark do not have this issue:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE DB_SPARK_39203.t7(id int) using parquet;\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE DB_SPARK_39203.t8(id int)\r\nstored as parquet\r\nLOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/db_spark_39203.db/t1';\r\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE

Also fixed the RateStreamProvider test to use only row values for requested range. Basically, for numeric increasing offsets, we could have called awaitOffset after the stream has moved past the expected newOffset or if committedOffsets changed after notify. In this case, its safe to exit, since at-least the given Offset has been reached and the equality condition might never be met.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixing bug with awaitOffset logic and RateStreamProvider test\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWith the current code, we were seeing race conditions where the test would hang and get terminated after a 60 min timeout. With the change, ran the specific test 100 times multiple times and verified that we don't see the test failure any more. Was also able to simulate the failure by introducing arbitrary sleep in the code paths and ensured that the test passes with the above fix. Also added small unit test for longOffset conversion validation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] RateStreamProviderSuite:\r\n[info] Passed: Total 0, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 0\r\n[info] No tests to run for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr change to use `ConstantColumnVector` to store partition columns in `VectorizedParquetRecordReader` because partition column vector always constant vector.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Partition columns vector alway constant vector.\r\n\r\n2. **Performance improvement**: `ConstantColumnVector` has better reading and writing performance than `OnHeapColumnVector` and `OffHeapColumnVector`. From the microbench results, the performance improvement is obvious for `StringType` : the read throughput is increased by  about 2 times, and the write throughput is increased by more than 100 times.\r\n\r\n3. **Memory saving**: `ConstantColumnVector` saves more memory than `OnHeapColumnVector` and `OffHeapColumnVector`, for `UTF8String` type Vector with length of 4096(default `batchSize`), 'ConstantColumnVector' can save more than 90% of memory compared with `OnHeapColumnVector`：\r\n\r\n-  - `ConstantColumnVector` only stores an `UTF8String`\r\n-  -  `OnHeapColumnVector` needs `arrayOffsets(int[4096])` + `arrayLengths(int[4096])` + `(UTF8String * 4096)`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Action\r\n- Add new UTs to test the new method introduced by this pr: `ColumnVectorUtils.fill(ConstantColumnVector col, InternalRow row, int fieldIdx)` \r\n- Add new micro benchmark to compare the read and write performance of constant vector(simulate partition column scene) between `OnHeapColumnVector`, `OffHeapColumnVector` and `ConstantColumnVector`","created_at":"2022-05-20T05:08:30Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T03:48:09Z","closed_at":"2022-06-29T16:22:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80f219b8a547524afb1308d23eff670d32adb883","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e8503f1771060152b61b5447604e1be2b68899d","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-39231","ref":"SPARK-39231","sha":"9e8503f1771060152b61b5447604e1be2b68899d","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen analyzing, apply WidenSetOperationTypes after other rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe following SQL returns 1.00 while 1.00000000000000000000 is expected since union should pick the wider precision, the `Decimal(38,20)` from `v / v` .\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW t3 AS VALUES (decimal(1)) tbl(v);\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW t4 AS SELECT CAST(v AS DECIMAL(18, 2)) AS v FROM t3;\r\n\r\nSELECT CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(28, 2))\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT v / v FROM t4;\r\n```\r\n\r\nChecking the analyzed logical plan of the above SQL, `Project [cast((v / v)#236 as decimal(28,2)) AS (v / v)#237]`  is added by `WidenSetOperationTypes` before `DecimalPrecision` promoting precision for the divide. The result of `v / v` is cast to the narrower `decimal(28,2)`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nCAST(1 AS DECIMAL(28,2)): decimal(28,2)\r\nUnion false, false\r\n:- Project [CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(28,2))#235]\r\n:  +- Project [cast(1 as decimal(28,2)) AS CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(28,2))#235]\r\n:     +- OneRowRelation\r\n+- Project [cast((v / v)#236 as decimal(28,2)) AS (v / v)#237]\r\n   +- Project [CheckOverflow((promote_precision(cast(v#228 as decimal(18,2))) / promote_precision(cast(v#228 as decimal(18,2)))), DecimalType(38,20), false) AS (v / v)#236]\r\n      +- SubqueryAlias t4\r\n         +- Project [cast(v#226 as decimal(18,2)) AS v#228]\r\n            +- SubqueryAlias t3\r\n               +- SubqueryAlias tbl\r\n                  +- LocalRelation [v#226]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence, I propose to apply `WidenSetOperationTypes` after `DecimalPrecision`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd UT.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-20T04:32:49Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T12:02:02Z","closed_at":"2022-05-31T12:02:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a244585ed142bd453e692938c6de0cb74701060","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62e1fb0974ca397e1ee76e8566deb25c6601a028","head":{"label":"manuzhang:spark-39238","ref":"spark-39238","sha":"62e1fb0974ca397e1ee76e8566deb25c6601a028","user":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132739917,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI3Mzk5MTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"manuzhang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR simply adds typed select methods to Dataset up to the max Tuple size of 22.\r\n\r\nThis has been bugging me for years, so I finally decided to get off my backside and do something about it :-).\r\n\r\nAs noted in the JIRA issue, technically, this is a breaking change - indeed, I had to remove an old test that specifically tested that Spark didn't support typed select for tuples larger than 5.  However, it would take someone explicitly relying on select returning a DataFrame instead of a Dataset when using select on large tuples of typed columns (though I guess that test I had to remove exhibits one case where this may happen).\r\n\r\nI've set the PR as WIP because I've been unable to run all tests so far - not due to the fix, but rather due to not having things set up correctly on my computer.  Still working on that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nArbitrarily supporting only up to 5-tuples is weird and unpredictable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, select on tuples of all typed columns larger than 5 will now return a Dataset instead of a DataFrame\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI've run all sql tests, and they all pass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis main change of this pr is replace all use of `Utils.createTempDir` with `JavaUtils.createTempDir`, the replacement rules are as follows:\r\n\r\n- `Utils.createTempDir()` -> `JavaUtils.createTempDir()`\r\n- `Utils.createTempDir(rootDir)` and `Utils.createTempDir(root = rootDir)` -> `JavaUtils.createTempDirWithRoot(rootDir)`\r\n- `Utils.createTempDir(namePrefix = prefix)` -> `JavaUtils.createTempDirWithPrefix(prefix)`\r\n- `Utils.createTempDir(rootDir, prefix)` -> `JavaUtils.createTempDir(rootDir, prefix)`\r\n\r\nAnother change is to delete `Utils.createTempDir()` method to keep only one `createTempDir()` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nKeep only one `createTempDir()` method in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn [#36094](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36094), a check for failing TimestampNTZ type output(since we are disabling TimestampNTZ in 3.3) is added:\r\n```\r\n      case operator: LogicalPlan\r\n        if !Utils.isTesting && operator.output.exists(attr =>\r\n          attr.resolved && attr.dataType.isInstanceOf[TimestampNTZType]) =>\r\n        operator.failAnalysis(\"TimestampNTZ type is not supported in Spark 3.3.\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the check can cause misleading error messages.\r\n\r\nIn 3.3:\r\n```\r\n> sql( \"select date '2018-11-17' > 1\").show()\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Invalid call to toAttribute on unresolved object;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias((2018-11-17 > 1), None)]\r\n+- OneRowRelation   \r\n \r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedAlias.toAttribute(unresolved.scala:510)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.Project.$anonfun$output$1(basicLogicalOperators.scala:70) \r\n```\r\nIn master or 3.2\r\n```\r\n> sql( \"select date '2018-11-17' > 1\").show()\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '(DATE '2018-11-17' > 1)' due to data type mismatch: differing types in '(DATE '2018-11-17' > 1)' (date and int).; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias((2018-11-17 > 1), None)]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis(package.scala:42) \r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should just remove the check to avoid such regression. It's not necessary for disabling TimestampNTZ anyway.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix regression in the error output of analysis check.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, it is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nBuild and try on

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSeparate query contexts for runtime errors from error-classes.json.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe message is JSON should only contain parameters explicitly thrown. It is more elegant to separate query contexts from error-classes.json.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Add a new spark property, `spark.properties.key.queue`, which specifies the key name for the queue information in the spark properties. When it is specified, the eventLog parser could use it as the key to extract the queue value from the `Spark Properties` in the eventLog files. Default to `spark.yarn.queue` which is the spark properties key name for queue in Yarn, but can be overridden as a spark conf if spark is running on other platforms. For example, when spark runs on K8s, the queue info may be specified as a pod annotation which is used by a scheduler to schedule jobs to the corresponding queues in the cluster. A example of such queue property key name in k8s could be `spark.kubernetes.driver.label.queue`.\r\n- Add `queue` attribute to the `ApplicationAttemptInfo` class, and modify the eventLog parser to parse it and add into the appList KV Store.\r\n- Add two query parameters(`queue` and `user`) for history server main page REST endpoint. With these new parameters, users could filter the returned application list by queue or user.\r\n- Add a `queue` column into the appList table.\r\n- Add links in the `queue` and `user` columns. This makes easier for users to click and browse in the web page. For example, clicking on `user1` will redirect the page to `https://shs_url/?user=user1`.\r\n- Add \"queue\" field to existing test cases accordingly.\r\n\r\nExample urls to filter the job list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://shs_url/?queue=poc\r\nhttps://shs_url/?user=mike\r\nhttps://shs_url/?queue=poc&user=mike\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark History Server suffers when there are large number of jobs under the `eventLog.dir`. Loading the SHS main page may be very slow. Users see a banner `Loading History Summary ...` before they can start to browse the app List.\r\n\r\nThe issue is because the current SHS returns all jobs in the appList KV Store to the client browser without any filtering. This resulted massive data transfer and slowness for SHS in a large environment. For most users, many of the returned jobs are not in their interests.\r\n\r\nWith the changes in the PR, users could increase the loading speed by adding a queue or user filter, such could avoid retrieving unneeded spark jobs and reduce the waiting time.\r\n\r\nIn addition, grouping spark jobs by `queue` is very common in spark platforms, including yarn, k8s etc.. Adding a `queue` column in the App List table could provide users useful information about their jobs.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR introduces two query parameters to users, and add a new `queue` column in the appList table.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Unit Tests. \r\n- Existing unit test `HistoryServerSuite` contains test cases for eventlog field extraction. One eventlog file for application_1628109047826_1317105 contains queue information as `spark_default`. So the existing test cases already cover the function of parsing queue information out of eventLog files.\r\n- Also tested locally and the resulted UI screen shots are attached.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n<img width=\"2003\" alt=\"shsQueryParaMainPage\"

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36365, we added the `to_char` function and uncommented some PostgreSQL tests. However, the `to_char` function in PostgreSQL is more powerful and many of the uncommented tests are not supported by Spark yet. This wastes test runtime and this PR comments out these unsupported tests like before.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ntest cleanup\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSeparate query contexts for runtime errors from error-classes.json.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe message is JSON should only contain parameters explicitly thrown. It is more elegant to separate query contexts from error-classes.json.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds the corruption exception handling for merged shuffle chunk when spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is set to true(default value is true)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPrior to Spark 3.0, spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is set to true by default, and this configuration is one of the knob for early corruption detection. So the fallback can be triggered as expected.\r\n\r\nAfter Spark 3.0, even though spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt is still set to true by default, but the early corruption detect knob is controlled with a new configuration spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt.useExtraMemory, and it set to false by default. Thus the default behavior, with only Magnet enabled after Spark 3.2.0(internal li-3.1.1), will disable the early corruption detection, thus no fallback will be triggered. And it will drop to throw an exception when start to read the corrupted blocks.\r\n\r\nWe handle the corrupted stream for merged blocks by throwing a FetchFailedException in this case. This will trigger a retry based on the values of spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt.useExtraMemory and spark.shuffle.detectCorrupt. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Tested on internal cluster\r\n- Added UT\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-18T21:47:29Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T20:57:34Z","closed_at":"2022-05-31T20:50:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"960d110e42599030ebfdbb0addf19105369ffd62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36601/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36601/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36601/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a6205a9162d12e80dbdcf9b0a64261be3d3a0612","head":{"label":"akpatnam25:SPARK-38987","ref":"SPARK-38987","sha":"a6205a9162d12e80dbdcf9b0a64261be3d3a0612","user":{"login":"akpatnam25","id":24758726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU4NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24758726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25","html_url":"https://github.com/akpatnam25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c97216c449f5993af0482b0caa689fa0c0cd56a6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWrap values of SQL configs and datasource options in error messages by double quotes. Added the `toDSOption()` method to `QueryErrorsBase` to quote DS options.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36579.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To highlight SQL config/DS option values and make them more visible for users.\r\n2. To be able to easily parse values from error text.\r\n3. To be consistent to other outputs of identifiers, sql statement and etc. where Spark uses quotes or ticks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the precision of the return type of round-like functions (round, bround, ceil, floor) with decimal inputs has a few problems:\r\n1. It does not reserve one more digit in the integral part, in the case of rounding. As a result, `CEIL(CAST(99 AS DECIMAL(2, 0)), -1)` fails.\r\n2. It should return more accurate precision, to count for the scale loose. For example, `CEIL(1.23456, 1)` does not need to keep the precision as 7 in the result.\r\n3. `round`/`bround` with negative scale fails if the input is decimal type. This is not a bug but a little weird.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these issues by correcting the formula of calculating the returned decimal type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix bugs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the new functions in 3.3:`ceil`/`floor` with scale parameter, can report a more accurate precision in the result type, and can run some certain queries which failed before. The old functions: `round` and `bround`, can support negative scale parameter with decimal inputs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Add a spark property, `spark.history.fs.update.batchSize`(default 1000), which specifies the batch size for updating new eventlog files.\r\n- For each eventlog scan/parse process, only a max of `spark.history.fs.update.batchSize` jobs are scanned/parsed. This allows the scan process ends within a reasonable time, so new eventlog files(appeared after the scan process starts) can be scanned sooner.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrent Spark History Server suffers when there are a large number of eventlog files under eventLog.dir: when a SHS starts, the initial scan may take a long time, and new eventlog files would not be scanned/parsed until the initial scan completes.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the initial scan takes 1-2 days(this is not uncommon in large environments), the newly finished spark jobs would not show up in SHS since their eventlog files are not scanned/parsed until the initial scan process finishes. This would result in a 1-2 days SHS malfunctioning since the newly finished spark jobs are most likely to be queried by users.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a limit for each scan process to `spark.history.fs.update.batchSize`, so that each scan can finish within a reasonable time(default 1000 jobs can usually be scanned in ~10-15 mins but this can vary depending on the sizes of the eventlog files). This will prevent the long initial scan process from blocking the newly appeared eventlog files be scanned.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested locally: \r\n\r\n- Tested with unit tests in the core module and all passed.\r\n- Placed 10 eventlog files under `eventLog.dir`, and set `spark.history.fs.update.batchSize` to 2. When the SHS started, observed that the scan process parsed 2 files at each time(starting from the files with the latest modification time).\r\n- Added a new eventlog file after the first scan started, and observed that the 2nd scan process picked up and parsed the new eventlog file before parsing other remaining (older) eventlog files.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark DS V2 push-down framework supports push down SQL to data sources.\r\nBut the DS V2 push-down framework only support push down the built-in functions to data sources.\r\nEach database have a lot very useful functions which not supported by Spark.\r\nIf we can push down these functions into data source, it will reduce disk I/O and network I/O and improve the performance when query databases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Spark can leverage the functions supported by databases\r\n2. Improve the query performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-18T09:36:08Z","updated_at":"2023-06-09T08:47:53Z","closed_at":"2022-06-30T10:03:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6bd5811f1f422e4bf18b0ab11700f7421b1e4ba8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3d985fdfdb97fb60a68a2213cad9f78c83729720","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-39139","ref":"SPARK-39139","sha":"3d985fdfdb97fb60a68a2213cad9f78c83729720","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

CAST_CAUSES_OVERFLOW -> CAST_OVERFLOW\r\n\r\nand change error messages:\r\n\r\nCAST_INVALID_INPUT:\r\n`The value <value> of the type <sourceType> cannot be cast to <targetType> because it is malformed. ...`\r\n\r\nCAST_OVERFLOW:\r\n`The value <value> of the type <sourceType> cannot be cast to <targetType> due to an overflow....`\r\n\r\nAlso quote the SQL config `\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\"` and a function name.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36553.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make the `foreachBatch` streaming query stop gracefully by handling the interrupted exceptions at `StreamExecution.isInterruptionException`.\r\n\r\nBecause there is no straightforward way to access to the original JVM exception, here we rely on string pattern match for now (see also \"Why are the changes needed?\" below). There is only one place from Py4J https://github.com/py4j/py4j/blob/master/py4j-python/src/py4j/protocol.py#L326-L328 so the approach would work at least.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn `foreachBatch`,  the Python user-defined function in the microbatch runs till the end even when `StreamingQuery.stop` is invoked. However, when any Py4J access is attempted within the user-defined function:\r\n\r\n- With the pinned thread mode disabled, the interrupt exception is not blocked, and the Python function is executed till the end in a different thread.\r\n- With the pinned thread mode enabled, the interrupt exception is raised in the same thread, and the Python thread raises a Py4J exception in the same thread.\r\n\r\nThe latter case is a problem because the interrupt exception is first thrown from JVM side (`java.lang. InterruptedException`) -> Python callback server (`py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError`) -> JVM (`py4j.Py4JException`), and `py4j.Py4JException` is not listed in `StreamExecution.isInterruptionException` which doesn't gracefully stop the query.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should handle this exception at `StreamExecution.isInterruptionException`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will make the query gracefully stop.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport time\r\n\r\ndef func(batch_df, batch_id):\r\n    time.sleep(10)\r\n    print(batch_df.count())\r\n\r\nq = spark.readStream.format(\"rate\").load().writeStream.foreachBatch(func).start()\r\ntime.sleep(5)\r\nq.stop()\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-18T06:45:52Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:50:23Z","closed_at":"2022-05-20T04:02:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e12b130591510bf9bbe27aef05d3054a3c7a194d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. Change `CreateTable` API to make it support 3 layer namespace.\r\n2. Change `ListTables` API such that a) it supports `database` parameter and if that `database` does not exist b) further check if the parameter is `catalog.database`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCreateTable and ListTables does not support 3 layer namespace.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The API change here is backward compatible and it extends the API to further support 3 layer namespace (e.g. catalog.database.table).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport JSON scans when the table schema has associated DEFAULT column values.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table t(i int) using json;\r\ninsert into t values(42);\r\nalter table t add column s string default concat('abc', def');\r\nselect * from t;\r\n> 42, 'abcdef'\r\n```\r\n\r\nInteresting note: JSON does not distinguish between NULL values and the absence of values. Therefore inserting NULL and then selecting back the same column yields the default value (if any), since the insert did not change any storage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change makes it easier to build, query, and maintain tables backed by JSON data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR includes new test coverage.","created_at":"2022-05-17T17:05:35Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T13:31:58Z","closed_at":"2022-05-24T13:31:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80bbd40495d4105b8a24377a458408cf46376ef2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/983a2b95a43edd8a5c6442a52e9b9e7f346967fa","head":{"label":"dtenedor:default-json","ref":"default-json","sha":"983a2b95a43edd8a5c6442a52e9b9e7f346967fa","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a4902c08f8c545cc7ddf595a86b84a60efb95359","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_vi

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWrap values of SQL configs and datasource options in error messages by double quotes. Added the `toDSOption()` method to `QueryErrorsBase` to quote DS options.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To highlight SQL config/DS option values and make them more visible for users.\r\n2. To be able to easily parse values from error text.\r\n3. To be consistent to other outputs of identifiers, sql statement and etc. where Spark uses quotes or ticks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRecord the query text when executed with SQL API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n* When executing a query using `SparkSession.sql`, the descript in UI is the call stack of this query. Using the query text should be more meaningful\r\n* Record the query text will allow the listeners to get more context of the executed query\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, in the UI, the descript of an executed query will be the raw query text if is available\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT 1 -- this is a test\").collect()\r\n```\r\n**Previous

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr add a `putByteArrays` method for `WritableColumnVector` as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic int putByteArrays(int rowId, int total, byte[] value) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method used to support setting multiple duplicate `byte[]` to `WritableColumnVector`. Since `byte[] value` is fixed length, memory can allocated at one time without calling `reserve(int requiredCapacity)` method many times.\r\n\r\nThe new method is applicable to `ColumnVectorUtils.populate` method with `StringType` and partial `DecimalType` scenario, this corresponds to the Vectorized Partition Column filling of Parquet and Orc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce `reserve(int requiredCapacity)` call times to avoid memory allocation times in setting multiple duplicate fixed length `byte[]` to  `WritableColumnVector` scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA\r\n- Add a `StringType` partition column test scenario in `DataSourceReadBenchmark`.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_332-b09 on Linux 5.13.0-1022-azure\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8272CL CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\nPartitioned

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere is a case for current code may cause data correctness issue: \r\n  1. One writing data task commit task success, but the container was killed after commit task, so this task failed, but the data file still remained under committedTaskPath .\r\n  2. DAGScheduler call `handleCompletedTask` and then call `outputCommitCoordinator.taskCompleted`,  outputCommitCoordinator will remove the lock of failed task's partition.\r\n  3. Then failed task's rerun with an new attempt,  the new attempt task call `outputCommitCoordinator.canCommit()` will return true since the lock of this partition had been removed, then it commit task success, also task final  succeed.\r\n  4. Two files remained under this job's attempt path for  same partition.\r\n  5. CommitJob commit both two committed task path's data.\r\n  6. Finally data duplicated.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, we do below since:\r\n\r\n1. When commit task success, executor send an CommitOutputSuccess message to  outputCommitCoordinator.\r\n2. When outputCommitCoordinator handle `taskComplete`, if task failed but commit success, means data duplicate will happen,  we should failed to job.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to introduce an extension point for pre resolution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA pre resolution enables developers or users to do some preparations before the actual resolution phase.\r\n\r\nFor example, the current catalog v2 implementations require setting SQL configurations ahead to activate, which is not flexible to use. Instead of using configuration, users are more likely to store and retrieve catalogs through meta storages, e.g. databases, kv stores, etc. The current relation resolution always falls back to the current/default catalog, which makes extra resolution rules unable to handle this issue. But W/ this feature we have opportunities to inject catalogs early.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nit is a dev oriented change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen reading JSON/CSV files with inferring timestamp types (`.option(\"inferTimestamp\", true)` or `.option(\"inferSchema\", true)`), the Timestamp conversion will throw and catch exceptions.\r\nAs we are putting decent error messages in the exception:\r\n```\r\n  def cannotCastToDateTimeError(\r\n      value: Any, from: DataType, to: DataType, errorContext: String): Throwable = {\r\n    val valueString = toSQLValue(value, from)\r\n    new SparkDateTimeException(\"INVALID_SYNTAX_FOR_CAST\",\r\n      Array(toSQLType(to), valueString, SQLConf.ANSI_ENABLED.key, errorContext))\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThrowing and catching the timestamp parsing exceptions is actually not cheap. It consumes more than 90% of the type inference time. \r\n\r\nThis PR improves the default timestamp parsing by returning optional results instead of throwing/catching the exceptions. With this PR, the schema inference time is reduced by 90% in a local benchmark.\r\n\r\nNote this PR is for the default timestamp parser. It doesn't cover the scenarios of\r\n* users provide a customized timestamp format via option\r\n* users enable legacy timestamp formatter\r\nWe can have follow-ups for it. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPerformance improvement.\r\nIt's also a fix for a perf regression of Spark 3.3.0.  @sadikovi found that the perf is 30% slower with the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36362 since the creation of the new exception is more expensive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UT\r\nAlso manual test the runtime to inferring a JSON file of 624MB with inferring timestamp enabled:\r\n```\r\nspark.read.option(\"inferTimestamp\", true).json(file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the change, it takes 166 seconds \r\nAfter the change, it only 16

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove `SparkIllegalStateException` and replace it by `IllegalStateException` where it was used.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36550.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance and be consistent to other places where `IllegalStateException` is used in illegal states (for instance, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36524). After the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36500, the exception is substituted by `SparkException` w/ the `INTERNAL_ERROR` error class.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Users shouldn't face to the exception in regular cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite*\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ArrowUtilsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\n(cherry

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove the numerical stability of skewness for cases with small `m2` and `m3`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nthe formulas to compute skewness were adjusted to be the same in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36549 \r\n\r\nbut for cases with small `m2` (like constant sequances), the results are still different.\r\n\r\nThat is because `pandas.core.nanops.nanskew` will zero out small `m2` and `m3`\r\n```\r\n    m2 = _zero_out_fperr(m2)\r\n    m3 = _zero_out_fperr(m3)\r\n```\r\nand return the final result as \r\n```\r\n        result = 0 if m2 == 0 else result\r\n        if count < 3:\r\n            return np.nan\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is to introduce this logic into Pandas API on

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to rename the error classes:\r\n1. INVALID_SYNTAX_FOR_CAST -> CAST_INVALID_INPUT\r\n2. CAST_CAUSES_OVERFLOW -> CAST_OVERFLOW\r\n\r\nand change error messages:\r\n\r\nCAST_INVALID_INPUT:\r\n`The value <value> of the type <sourceType> cannot be cast to <targetType> because it is malformed. ...`\r\n\r\nCAST_OVERFLOW:\r\n`The value <value> of the type <sourceType> cannot be cast to <targetType> due to an overflow....`\r\n\r\nAlso quote the SQL config `\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\"` and a function name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by making errors/error classes related to CAST more clear and **unified**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *CastSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DateFormatterSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *TimestampFormatterSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Add a new optimizer rule(PushPartialAggregationThroughJoin) to push the partial aggregation through join.  It supports the following cases:\r\n   - Push down partial sum, count, avg, min, max, first and last through inner join.\r\n   - Partial deduplicate the children of join if the aggregation itself is group only.\r\n\r\n2. Add a new optimizer rule(DeduplicateRightSideOfLeftSemiAntiJoin) to partial deduplicate the right side of left semi/anti join.\r\n\r\n3. Make partial aggregation adaptive to skip do partial aggregation if this step does not reduce the number of rows too much.\r\n    \r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1(a int, b int, c int) using parquet;\r\nCREATE TABLE t2(x int, y int, z int) using parquet;\r\n\r\nEXPLAIN EXTENDED SELECT b, SUM(c) FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.x GROUP BY b;\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [b#1], [b#1, sum((_pushed_sum_c#12L * cnt#15L)) AS sum(c)#7L]\r\n+- Project [_pushed_sum_c#12L, b#1, cnt#15L]\r\n   +- Join Inner, (a#0 = x#3)\r\n      :- PartialAggregate [a#0, b#1], [sum(c#2) AS _pushed_sum_c#12L, a#0, b#1]\r\n      :  +- Project [b#1, c#2, a#0]\r\n      :     +- Filter isnotnull(a#0)\r\n      :        +- Relation default.t1[a#0,b#1,c#2] parquet\r\n      +- PartialAggregate [x#3], [count(1) AS cnt#15L, x#3]\r\n         +- Project [x#3]\r\n            +- Filter isnotnull(x#3)\r\n               +- Relation default.t2[x#3,y#4,z#5] parquet\r\n\r\nEXPLAIN EXTENDED SELECT DISTINCT b, y FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.a = t2.x;\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [b#1, y#4], [b#1, y#4]\r\n+- Project [b#1, y#4]\r\n   +- Join Inner, (a#0 = x#3)\r\n      :- PartialAggregate [a#0, b#1], [a#0, b#1]\r\n      :  +- Project [a#0, b#1]\r\n      :     +- Filter isnotnull(a#0)\r\n      :        +- Relation default.t1[a#0,b#1,c#2] parquet\r\n      +- Project [x#3, y#4]\r\n         +- Filter isnotnull(x#3)\r\n            +- Relation default.t2[x#3,y#4,z#5] parquet\r\n\r\nSET spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1;\r\nEXPLAIN EXTENDED SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a IN (SELECT x FROM t2);\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nJoin LeftSemi, (a#11 = x#14)\r\n:- Relation default.t1[a#11,b#12,c#13] parquet\r\n+- PartialAggregate [x#14], [x#14]\r\n   +- Project [x#14]\r\n      +- Relation default.t2[x#14,y#15,z#16] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Improve query performance\r\n4. Many databases have similar rules. For example: [Teradata](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Teradata-VantageTM-SQL-Request-and-Transaction-Processing/March-2019/Join-Planning-and-Optimization/Partial-GROUP-BY-Block-Optimization), [Calcite](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-366), [Hive](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-10785), [Trino's PushPartialAggregationThroughJoin](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/375/core/trino-main/src/main/java/io/trino/sql/planner/iterative/rule/PushPartialAggregationThroughJoin.java), [Trino's  OptimizeDuplicateInsensitiveJoins](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/382/core/trino-main/src/main/java/io/trino/sql/planner/iterative/rule/OptimizeDuplicateInsensitiveJoins.java) and [Presto](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/0.271/presto-main/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/sql/planner/iterative/rule/PushPartialAggregationThroughJoin.java).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark test.\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove `SparkIllegalStateException` and replace it by `IllegalStateException` where it was used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance and be consistent to other places where `IllegalStateException` is used in illegal states (for instance, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36524). After the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36500, the exception is substituted by `SparkException` w/ the `INTERNAL_ERROR` error class.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Users shouldn't face to the exception in regular cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite*\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ArrowUtilsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-05-14T10:01:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-16T05:24:19Z","closed_at":"2022-05-16T05:24:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b818f6b69e15ab393555a57f92a7fbb1e091f20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36550/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36550/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36550/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c3aae3d34ea4c14d51ba83e3b779d464659c47d1","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:remove-SparkIllegalStateException","ref":"remove-SparkIllegalStateException","sha":"c3aae3d34ea4c14d51ba83e3b779d464659c47d1","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror
