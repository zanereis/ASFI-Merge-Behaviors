Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to parameterize the hostnames for the Kafka and Druid instances such that the jupyter lab environment and its set of notebooks can run on against a variety of deployments. It also standardizes how notebooks are created such that they make use of these environment variables when connecting to Kafka or Druid.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjusted the docker compose files to use defaults for \r\nDRUID_VERSION -> defaults to 26.0\r\nDRUID_HOST -> defaults to \"router\" which works with Druid deployed with the docker compose\r\nKAFKA_HOST -> defaults to \"kafka\" which works with Kafka deployed with docker compose\r\n\r\nAlso added a jupyter notebook template @`examples/ that shows how to initialize both kafka and druid host variables in order to make the notebooks work with this parameterized hosts approach.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing these variables users can use the notebooks on other instances of Druid and/or Kafka.\r\nExamples: \r\n- If you run both Kafka and Druid standalone in the local system and only run jupyter through docker compose:\r\n`KAFKA_HOST=host.docker.internal DRUID_HOST=host.docker.internal docker compose --profile jupyter up -d`\r\n- If you run Druid standalone in the local system and run kafka and jupyter through docker compose:\r\n`DRUID_HOST=host.docker.internal docker compose --profile kafka-jupyter up -d`\r\n- Self-contained startup with all services running:\r\n`docker compose --profile all-services up -d`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

This PR checks for Boolean filter and disqualify the rewrite for non unnest cols. \r\n\r\nAdding the 3 tests that covers the given scenario. \r\n \r\n```\r\nselect * from ( \r\n          select * from (\r\n                         select * from mytest, unnest(mv_to_array(c2)) as u(n1)\r\n                     ), unnest(mv_to_array(c2)) as u(n2)\r\n               ), unnest(mv_to_array(c2)) as u(n3)\r\nwhere n1='A' and c1>=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n3rd test case cover the nested filer scenario for unnest filters, This PR address the unpack the nested OR/AND filters and attempt to rewrite only for qualified filters. \r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT dimZipf, dim3_unnest1, dim3_unnest2, dim3_unnest3 FROM \r\n      ( SELECT * FROM \r\n           ( SELECT * FROM lotsocolumns, UNNEST(MV_TO_ARRAY(dimMultivalEnumerated)) as ut(dim3_unnest1) )           ,UNNEST(MV_TO_ARRAY(dimMultivalEnumerated)) as ut(dim3_unnest2) \r\n      ), UNNEST(MV_TO_ARRAY(dimMultivalEnumerated)) as ut(dim3_unnest3)  WHERE dimZipf=27 AND (dim3_unnest1='Baz' OR dim3_unnest2='Hello') AND dim3_unnest3='World'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Motivation\r\n\r\n#### What is usage skew?\r\nUsage skew between historicals in a tier refers to a difference in terms of: \r\n1. overall disk usage\r\n2. number of segments of each datasource\r\n3. total number of segments (already covered by 2)\r\n4. cost of placing a segment (difficult to quantify as it depends on datasource and interval of the segment)\r\n\r\n#### Why is skew bad?\r\n- Queries may perform poorly.\r\n- Historicals may go out of memory.\r\n- Historicals may run out of disk space.\r\n\r\n#### Current methods of mitigation\r\n|Method|Cons|\r\n|--------|-----|\r\n|Let the cluster balance itself.|This may take up to several hours. This is because clusters typically have a low value of `maxSegmentsToMove` and the Coordinator looks only at small samples of segments to determine what to move in each cycle. These samples often contain segments that do not even need to be moved and the Coordinator skips moving them, thus wasting cycles.|\r\n|Use a high value of `maxSegmentsToMove`.|A value of `maxSegmentsToMove` that takes care of all scenarios would have to be very high and might lead to unnecessary moves when the cluster is already balanced.|\r\n|Increase and decrease `maxSegmentsToMove` manually when required.|Requires a lot of timely user intervention.|\r\n\r\n#### Proposed solution\r\nCompute `maxSegmentsToMove` dynamically based on the current cluster state.\r\n\r\n### Definitions\r\n- `maxSegmentsToMove`: Maximum number of segments _allowed_ to be moved in a coordinator run.\r\nThis limit is to ensure that the coordinator:\r\n  - does not get stuck doing too many cost computations in every run\r\n  - does not perform too many moves when the cluster is already well-balanced\r\n- `segmentsToMove`: Number of segments sampled from all the loaded and loading segments that are considered for moving. The `BalancerStrategy` is consulted for these segments to find the optimal server to place them. It may also be that a segments is already optimally placed and is thus not moved at all.\r\n\r\n### Existing implementation\r\nWhen `smartSegmentLoading` is disabled\r\n- Use the value of `maxSegmentsToMove` as configured by the user in coordinator dynamic config\r\n- `segmentsToMove = maxSegmentsToMove`\r\n\r\nWhen `smartSegmentLoading` is enabled\r\n- Calculate `maxSegmentsToMove = Math.min(1000, 2% of numUsedSegments)`\r\n- `segmentsToMove = maxSegmentsToMove`\r\n\r\n### Proposed implementation\r\n- No change in behaviour if `smartSegmentLoading` is disabled\r\n- If `smartSegmentLoading` is enabled\r\n  - Compute `balancerComputeThreads` based on `numUsedSegments`\r\n  - Compute `maxSegmentsToMove` based on `balancerComputeThreads`\r\n  - Compute `segmentsToMoveToFixSkew` based on difference in disk usage and number of segments\r\n  - Compute `segmentsToMove = Math.min(maxSegmentsToMove, segmentsToMoveToFixSkew)`\r\n  \r\nSee [Calculations](#calculations) for details of how each parameter is computed.\r\n\r\n### Limits\r\n- 1 <= `balancerComputeThreads` <= 8\r\n- `maxSegmentsToMove` <= 20% of total segments\r\n- `minSegmentsToMove` = 0.6% of total segments\r\n\r\n### Classes to review\r\n * `SegmentsToMoveCalculator`\r\n * `BalanceSegments`\r\n * `TierSegmentBalancer`\r\n\r\n### <a name='calculations' href='#calculations'>#</a> Calculations\r\n\r\n#### `balancerComputeThreads`\r\nDef: _Number of threads used by balancing executor to perform cost computations._\r\n\r\nCalculated based on the number of used segments in the cluster. The number of used segments is used as a proxy for the total projected segments in the cluster as these are the ones which actually participate in balancing cost computation.\r\n\r\nThe number of threads increases in increasing step sizes.\r\n**The current max value is 8 threads.**\r\n\r\n|Used segments|`balancerComputeThreads`|\r\n|---------------:|----------------------------:|\r\n|0 to 50,000|1 |\r\n|50,000 to 100,000|2|\r\n|100,000 to 175,000|3|\r\n|175,000 to 250,000|4|\r\n|250,000 to 350,000|5|\r\n|350,000 to 450,000|6|\r\n|450,000 to 600,000|7|\r\n|600,000 and above|8|\r\n\r\n#### `maxComputationsPerThread`\r\nDef: _Maximum number of computations that can be performed on each thread in a single coordinator run._\r\n\r\n1 computation = calculation of joint cost of 1 pair of segments\r\n\r\nAs established in #14484 , 4 balancer compute threads are able to perform cost computations for 1000 moving segments in a cluster of 1 million total segments in about 5s. Thus,\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntotal computations with 4 threads in 5s = 1k * 1M = 1B\r\n⇒ total computations per thread in 5s = 250M\r\n⇒ total computations per thread in 40s = 2B\r\n\r\nmaxComputationsPerThread (per coordinator cycle) = ~2B\r\n\r\n// This still leaves us a buffer of 20s in the typical coordinator time of 1 min\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### `maxSegmentsToMove`\r\nDef: _Maximum number of segments allowed to be moved in a tier in a coordinator run._\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntotalSegments = all segments in cluster that would participate in cost computations\r\ntotalSegments = all loaded and queued(loading, moving, dropping) segments across all historicals\r\n\r\ntotalComputations = maxSegmentsToMove * totalSegments = numThreads * maxComputationsPerThread\r\n\r\nmaxSegmentsToMove = (numThreads * maxComputationsPerThread) / totalSegments\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### `minSegmentsToMove`\r\nDef: _Minimum number of segments to consider for move so that the cluster is always balancing itself._\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Value increases by 100 for every 2^14 = ~16k segments\r\n// i.e. minSegmentsToMove = ~0.6% of totalSegments\r\n minSegmentsToMove = Math.max(100, (totalSegments >> 14) * 100)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### `segmentsToMoveToFixSkew`\r\n\r\n```java\r\ndiskUsage = projected disk usage of a historical in the tier\r\ndiff in diskUsage = max(diskUsage) - min(diskUsage)\r\ncountDiff1 = (max(diskUsage) - min(diskUsage)) / avgSegmentSize\r\n\r\nfor each datasource:\r\n  countDiffForDatasource = max(numSegments) - min(numSegments)\r\n\r\ncountDiff2 = max(countDiffForDatasource)\r\n\r\nsegmentsToMoveToFixSkew = Math.max(countDiff1, countDiff2) / 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### `segmentsToMove`\r\nDef: _Number of segments finally considered for moving between active servers in a tier._\r\n\r\n```java\r\nsegmentsToMove = Math.max(minSegmentsToMove, Math.min(maxSegmentsToMove, segmentsToMoveToFixSkew))\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Note: If there are decommissioning servers in a tier, the above computations are modified slightly to prioritize move from decommissioning servers.\r\n\r\n### Computed `balancerComputeThreads` and `maxSegmentsToMove`\r\n\r\n| Used segments | `balancerComputeThreads` | `maxSegmentsToMove`<br/>with 1 replica per segment | `minSegmentsToMove` <br/>with 1 replica per segment |\r\n|----------------:|-----------------------------:|------------------------:|----------:|\r\n| 1,000 | 1 | 125 | 100 |\r\n| 10,000 | 1 | 1,900 | 100 |\r\n| 50,000 | 2 | 9,700 | 100 |\r\n|100,000 | 3 | 19,500 | 100 |\r\n| 200,000 | 4 | 39,000 | 300|\r\n| 300,000 | 5 | 34,000 | 400|\r\n| 400,000 | 6 | 31,000 |600|\r\n| 500,000 | 7 | 29,000 |700|\r\n| 1,000,000 | 8 | 16,000 |1,500|\r\n| 2,000,000 | 8 | 8,000 |3,000|\r\n| 10,000,000 | 8 | 1,000 |15,200|\r\n\r\n### Assumptions\r\nThese assumptions always apply when using `cost` balancer strategy and are not specific to the implementation proposed here.\r\n1. All historicals in a tier have the same amount of maximum disk space and on-heap memory.\r\n2. Segments of same granularity have similar cost. In other words, all DAY segments are considered to occupy nearly the same amount of disk space.\r\n3. Segments of higher granularity have higher cost, cost of MONTH segment = ~ 30 x cost of DAY segment.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\nAdjust `balancerComputeThreads` and `maxSegmentsToMove` automatically based on usage skew between the historicals in a tier. An imbalanced cluster now rectifies itself much faster without requiring any user intervention.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR uses the QoSFilter available in Jetty to park the query requests that exceed a configured limit. This is done so that other HTTP requests such as health check calls do not get blocked if the query server is busy serving long-running queries. The same mechanism can also be used in the future to isolate interactive queries from long-running select queries from interactive queries within the same broker. \r\n\r\nRight now, you can still get that isolation by setting druid.query.scheduler.numThreads to a value lowe than druid.server.http.numThreads. That enables total laning but the side effect is that excess requests are not queued and rejected outright that leads to a bad user experience. \r\n\r\nParked requests are timed out after 30 seconds by default. I overrode that to the maxQueryTimeout in this PR. \r\n\r\nI tested it on a local cluster and verified that it works. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis is a follow up change to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14443 which added a new metric **service/heartbeat** for monitoring service health.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nExpose **service/heartbeat** metric to statsd-reporter.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * add a new entry in **defaultMetricDimensions.json** to expose the new metric to statsd-reporter\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #NA.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nDue to future unavailability of semaphore cache, the use of `cache` has been removed in this PR.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

the various test files from the Drill tests for window functions.  The initial test running stuff was included in #13773 (including the changes to attribute credit to the Drill project for the files) and this PR is just extra test files to feed the tests.\r\n\r\nAs of this point in time, the results of the tests are largely ignored.  Things *do* run however, but the run of 1000 query tests takes ~13 seconds on my local laptop, so it should not amount to a significant increase in test run times.  After these are checked in, we will begin the work of whack-a-moling the issues and making the results actually validated.\r\n\r\nNote for reviewers: I'm hoping that since the changes are all in test files and completely located in the `test/resources` directory, the review can simply be one that validates that there are no code changes included in the set of files.  Any commentary on the contents of the files is likely to be met with a response of \"I didn't change it from what we got from the drill test project, so will look at the content later when working through the

Motivation\r\n[SegmentMetadata queries](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/segmentmetadataquery.html) currently supports two types of aggregator merge strategies, namely strict and lenient, when \"aggregators\" analysis type is enabled. Users often want something less strict than a lenient policy, where the most recent aggregator is selected for a column in an evolving data model. A strict strategy is best suited once the data model is locked in.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Adds a new property, `aggregatorMergeStrategy`, to `segmentMetadata` queries. Please see `docs/querying/segmentmetadataquery.md` for more information.  This also allows us to define an earliest strategy (similar to the latest strategy) or more sophisticated merge strategies as needed.\r\n- Deprecates the existing `lenientAggregatorMerge` boolean property in favor of `aggregatorMergeStrategy`.\r\n- Validates that both the old and new property is not set. The new property is backwards compatible with the deprecated property, so the default is `strict` when aggregators analysis type is enabled. \r\n- Changes the segment id of merged segments as part of segmentMetadata analysis, from `merged` to  `<datasource>_<interval>_merged_<partition_number>`  format. \r\n- Adjusts unit tests to assert the complete `SegmentAnalysis` object instead of just the aggregators. Also, add tests for latest aggregator merge and backwards compatibility logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

several segments become eligible for a DropRule in a single coordinator run, multiple metadata update statements are fired which could have potentially been batched.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n- Collect segment delete operations in `StrategicSegmentAssigner` during `RunRules` duty\r\n- Perform batch delete for each datasource at the end of `RunRules` duty\r\n- Move collection of some stats from `CollectSegmentAndServerStats` to the respective duties generating those stats for clarity\r\n- Clean up `SqlSegmentsMetadataQuery` API for marking segments as used/unused\r\n- Add basic simulation test for Coordinator runs\r\n- Add simulation test to verify that segment moves are cancelled if the target server disappears\r\n\r\n### Classes to review:\r\n- `DruidCoordinator`\r\n- `CollectSegmentAndServerStats`\r\n- `StrategicSegmentAssigner`\r\n- `RunRules`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

Description\r\n\r\nThis is in context for the string writers present in the frames. Currently, Frames treat `[]` and `[null]` equivalently. This is fine for MVDs since there can be still some inconsistencies in how they are treated in the selectors, therefore we needn't make a special effort in Frames to support this difference.\r\nHowever, for string arrays, this change is crucial as `[]`, `null`, and `[null]` are not the same, and should never be treated as such.\r\nThis PR adds support for distinguishing between these values in the frames written by string writers (both row-based and columnar)\r\n\r\n#### For row-based writers (FieldWriters)\r\nWe prepend a byte denoting if the string is null or non-null.\r\nWe can prepend this to the string array to distinguish `null` values from all others. In my implementation, I have created a matric where we coalesce the array null-check byte with the first element's null-check byte to conserve some space (at the cost of increasing the code's complexity). \r\n\r\n#### For column-based writers (ColumnWriters)\r\nWe store the cumulative string length and the data length for the writers. For nulls, instead of storing 0, we can store it as -1. However, this warrants a change in the format (where we add another integer to the memory) that denotes the different region's start positions (as these can non-monotonically decrease).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth the changes are forward compatible, i.e. the new readers would be able to read the columns written by old writers, however, the frame written by a new writer won't be read correctly by an older reader. \r\n\r\nRaising it as a draft PR to gather some feedback on the approach. \r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR introduces some new filter types which aim to be both more SQL compliant and also work better with various types by accepting match values in types other than String. The new filters are `EqualityFilter`, `NullFilter`, and `RangeFilter`, which serve as replacements for `SelectorDimFilter` and `BoundDimFilter`. Effectively `SelectorDimFilter` is being split into `NullFilter` and `EqualityFilter`, and `BoundDimFilter` is superceded by `RangeFilter`.\r\n\r\nProbably the most notable change in behavior is that the `EqualityFilter` and `RangeFilter` will never match null values. \r\n\r\nCompare the current behavior of the bound filter:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-05 at 6 13 14 PM](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/6556d745-126b-4264-af09-3fccf9934c42)\r\n\r\nto the behavior of the new range filter:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-05 at 6 14 20 PM](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/ea098425-cef0-493e-b5c6-b2d3bbd0d50e)\r\n\r\n Use of these new filters is currently tied by default to the value of SQL compatibility mode, `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`, but is controlled separately through a planner/query context parameter `sqlUseBoundAndSelectors`, which when `true` will use the classic filters, but when `false` will plan into the new filters.\r\n\r\nBecause the new filters accept all types rather than just strings, it also means that we can now support filtering equality and ranges on ARRAY columns\r\n<img width=\"876\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-05 at 5 49 32 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/84312623-040a-461f-b2a1-4457ad669d2d\">\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 1 59 21 PM](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/69270fa2-ec55-4a0d-8505-b52721141850)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe null filter also supports proper object predicate matching, so `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL` work correctly on `COMPLEX<json>` columns (and any other complex type):\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 1 44 33 PM](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/7262c11a-be6c-4805-8e82-8ad1fe5ed1ef)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 1 44 40 PM](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/c5f645e0-72b3-4a06-877e-1dcf92b55124)\r\n\r\n#### Equality filter\r\nA lot like the `SelectorDimFilter`, but it will _never_ match null. It also implements array matching, so it can be used for array equality as well. \r\n| parameters | description | required |\r\n| --- | --- | ---|\r\n| `type` | must be `\"equals\"` | yes |\r\n| `column` | column (or virtual column) name to filter for null values | yes |\r\n| `matchValue` | Value to match, must not be null | yes |\r\n| `matchValueType` | type of the match value, e.g. `\"STRING\"`, `\"LONG\"`, `\"FLOAT\"`, `\"DOUBLE\"`, `\"ARRAY<STRING>\"`, `\"ARRAY<LONG>\"`, etc. | yes |\r\n| `filterTuning` | optional filter tuning to control if filtering will use bitmap indexes | no |\r\n\r\nI did add special handling for `COMPLEX<json>`, because it is more of an unofficial built-in type than a standard complex, but I can imagine in the future we allow complex types to opt into providing a customized equality check so that they could be supported here as well, but currently at least anything that can be checked with Objects.equals should work correctly. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 1 51 11 PM](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/a7dd5cb7-4e6a-4241-bea3-b0d92b270f13)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 2 22 32 PM](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/d689ee1c-ee60-4dec-afef-ba993be49aa3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't really added any tests for json matching since i just snuck it in on the side, so it is totally possible there might be cases where Objects.equals doesn't match things that are equivalent otherwise.\r\n\r\n#### Null filter\r\nThe `null` filter is a dedicated filter for matching `NULL`, and when enabled in the planner will be used for all `IS NULL` and (combined with a `NotDimFilter`) `IS NOT NULL` filtering, as well as any implicit null/not null. It is separated from the `EqualityFilter` for future work of making it easier to fix some additional SQL compliance bugs involving filter negation, and is more consistent with SQL behavior.\r\n\r\n| parameters | description | required |\r\n| --- | --- | ---|\r\n| `type` | must be `\"null\"` | yes |\r\n| `column` | column (or virtual column) name to filter for null values | yes |\r\n| `filterTuning` | optional filter tuning to control if filtering will use bitmap indexes | no |\r\n\r\n#### Range filter\r\nA lot like the bound filter, but also never matches null. Instead of accepting a comparator argument, it instead takes a matchValueType, which implies a certain comparator. For range filters on string columns, if the match value type is numeric we use the numeric string comparator, otherwise the lexicographic. For range filters on numeric and array columns, the match value is cast to the columns numeric processor type\r\n\r\n| parameters | description | required |\r\n| --- | --- | ---|\r\n| `type` | must be `\"range\"` | yes |\r\n| `column` | column (or virtual column) name to filter for null values | yes |\r\n| `matchValueType` | type of the match value, e.g. `\"STRING\"`, `\"LONG\"`, `\"FLOAT\"`, `\"DOUBLE\"`, etc. | yes |\r\n| `lower` | lower bound value, or null if there is no lower bound | no (however, at least one of lower or upper must be specified) |\r\n| `upper` | upper bound value, or null if there is no upper bound | no (however, at least one of lower or upper must be specified) |\r\n| `lowerOpen` | if the value must be strictly greater than the lower bound, or if it may also be equal | no, defaults to false |\r\n| `upperOpen` | if the value must be strictly less than the upper bound, or it may also be equal | no, defaults to false |\r\n| `filterTuning` | optional filter tuning to control if filtering will use bitmap indexes | no |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n* Removed `isFilterable` from `ColumnCapabilities`. All types of columns should have the chance to participate in filtering without having to set this flag. This mechanism was wired into a short-circuit that would always use a 'nil' column selector when filtering on columns whose isFilterable was set to false.\r\n* Fixed compaction for ARRAY typed columns (by side effect sort of from making column processor factory interface have array handling), added test\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Motivation\r\nThere have been several instances in our prod clusters where we have seen task runner threads being stuck for acquisition of the `statusLock`. This may even lead to Coordinator being stuck while submitting/querying task statuses during `CompactSegments` duty.\r\n\r\n### \r\nMost of the other methods that read from the list of tasks in `HttpRemoteTaskRunner` do not need to acquire locks as this is already a `ConcurrentMap`.\r\n\r\nAll of the usages of `getKnownTasks` are either for serving APIs or for reporting some metrics. So we can safely remove the lock requirement from here.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

duties on the Coordinator run on the same single-threaded executor including historical management duties (segment loading and balancing) and auto-compaction.\r\n\r\nIf auto-compaction gets stuck for some reason (such as slowness while submitting tasks), it can block up the whole coordination flow causing delayed segment handoffs and ingestion failures.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to remedy this situation by not blocking coordinator while submitting compaction tasks by using the async `OverlordClient` instead of `IndexingServiceClient`.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add new methods to `OverlordClient`\r\n- Use `OverlordClient` in `CompactSegments`\r\n- All methods except submission of task still happen synchronously by using `future.get()`.\r\n- Fix up tests\r\n\r\n### Pending validation\r\n- Cluster testing\r\n- Case: A compaction task is submitted to the overlord but the request hasn't finished yet and the next duty cycle has already started. In such a case, the coordinator might try to submit a duplicate compaction task for that interval. Ideally, the compaction task submitted later should just be cancelled if the first one is still running. Alternatively, we could simply maintain a state of recently submitted (but not started) compaction tasks in the `CompactSegments` duty to ensure that we do not submit duplicate tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternate approach/Further improvement\r\n- The coordinator duties can be moved to a completely separate executor but that would require some validation to ensure that there are no race conditions between historical management duties and coordinator duties (most likely, there shouldn't be)\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nMost of the places in MSQ currently rely on the older error code, dating pre https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14004. This is an attempt to fix the bits of the error code in the places where bits of MSQ reside in the broker. This extends upon the PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14531.\r\n\r\n1. The MSQTaskQueryMaker and the MSQTaskEngine might return a different error code for some invalid cases (which might not be inline with what the behavior originally was, but is correct now). For example, setting `maxNumTasks` to 1 would return a 500 error code, which is not right since its an invalid user input. This was the original behavior, and this PR changes that. \r\n2. The EXTERN function returns a 400 error code if the parameters to it are incorrect (which is in line with what its behavior originally was and is correct) \r\n\r\nNote: This PR doesn't unify the DruidExceptions with the MSQException\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nMSQ engine returns correct error codes for invalid user inputs in the query context\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n`TaskQueue.notifyStatus` is often a heavy call as it performs the following operations:\r\n- Update task status in metadata DB\r\n- Update task locks in metadata DB\r\n- Request (synchronously) the task runner to shutdown the completed task\r\n- Clean up in-memory data structures\r\n\r\nThis method can often be slow and can cause worker sync / task runners to slow down.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Run task completion callbacks in a separate executor to handle task completion updates\r\n- Add config to handle the number of threads of the new callback executor\r\n- Add metrics to monitor number of processed and queued items\r\n- Use `CoordinatorRunStats` to collect and report metrics. This class has been used as is for now but will later be renamed and repurposed across all Druid services.\r\n- Add `TaskCountStatsProvider.getStats()` which deprecates the other `getXXXTaskCount` methods.\r\n- There are still other paths that can invoke `notifyStatus`, but those need not be moved to the new executor as they are synchronous on purpose.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Add new config `druid.indexer.queue.taskCompleteHandlerNumThreads` which controls the number of threads used by the Overlord `TaskQueue` to handle task completion updates received from the workers.\r\n- Add new metrics `task/status/queue/count`, `task/status/updated/count`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-06T11:22:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T11:58:03Z","closed_at":"2023-07-07T15:13:13Z","merged_at":"2023-07-07T15:13:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"40d0dc9e0e02c89f91762a400ecdd84b950907ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2717749995,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE3NzQ5OTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nOne of the most requested features in druid is to have an ability to download big result sets.\r\nAs part of #14416 , we added an ability for MSQ to be queried via a query friendly endpoint. This PR builds upon that work and adds the ability for MSQ to write `select` results to durable storage.\r\n\r\nWe write the results to the durable storage location  `<prefix>/results/<queryId>` in the druid frame format. This is exposed to users by\r\n `/v2/sql/statements/:queryId/results`. \r\n \r\n The broker now understands how to read frame files from durable storage and return the results as a `json` format to end users. \r\n \r\n We also write the first 3000 rows of the result to task report to enable preview results for clients like the console. \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\nUsers can use this by setting the context flag \r\n`selectDestination:DURABLE_STORAGE` while issuing select q's to MSQ. \r\nNote that `DURABLE_STORAGE` needs to be configured on broker, overlord, ingestion tasks/indexers captured at : https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/multi-stage-query/reference.html#enable-durable-storage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nAfter #13197 , several coordinator configs are now redundant as they are not being used anymore, neither with `smartSegmentLoading` nor otherwise.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Remove dynamic configs `emitBalancingStats`: balancer error stats are always emitted, debug stats can be logged by using `debugDimensions`\r\n- `useBatchedSegmentSampler`, `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove`: batched segment sampling is always used\r\n- Add test to verify deserialization with unknown properties\r\n- Update `CoordinatorRunStats` to always track stats, even if the stat will never be emitted or logged.\r\n  - There are currently only 2 such stats. When we add more such stats, we can optimize this later.\r\n  - Keeping the logic to not collect such stats will require `debugDimensions` to be passed to `CostBalancerStrategy` via `CostBalancerStrategyFactory.createStrategy()`, which seems an overkill.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\nThe following Coordinator dynamic configs have been removed:\r\n- `emitBalancingStats`: Stats for errors encountered while balancing will always be emitted. Other debugging stats will not be emitted but can be logged by setting the appropriate `debugDimensions`.\r\n- `useBatchedSegmentSampler`, `percentOfSegmentsToConsiderPerMove`: Batched segment sampling is now the standard and will always be on.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIn MSQ, queries of the following sorts fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO foo1 \r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('DAY', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1'DAY) AS __time, SUM(m1) AS sum_m1\r\nFROM foo\r\nPARTITIONED BY DAY\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a bug in the `GroupByQueryKit` because the absence of the dimensions causes the query kit to push everything into a single partition (using `GlobalSortMaxCountShuffleSpec`) however this shuffle spec doesn't support \"buckets\", which is needed in case the PARTITIONED BY is present.\r\n\r\nThe fix involves adding an additional check to ensure that the bucketing is not present in the clustering columns. \r\n\r\nNote 1: There can be multiple fixes for the above, and the current code should have worked as well if there was no sanity check in the `GlobalSortMaxCountShuffleSpec` class since we will ultimately get a single row in all the cases.\r\n\r\nNote 2: The query would fail if the time was populated by an aggregator instead of a post-aggregator (expression)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `GroupByQueryKit`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets

ConsoleLoggingEnforcementConfigurationFactory would still enforce an additional ConsoleAppender if there are multiple ConsoleAppender defined\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14094 allow for multiple/existing log4j appenders to be kept when there is a ConsoleAppender configured for a Logger. However, this doesn't work as expected when there are multiple ConsoleAppender defined. The function ConsoleLoggingEnforcementConfigurationFactory#findConsoleAppender currently only considered the first ConsoleAppender it finds and verify that this ConsoleAppender is set in the Loggers. However, this fails to consider that multiple ConsoleAppenders could be defined. When we ensure there is a console logger defined for each Logger (in the function ConsoleLoggingEnforcementConfigurationFactory#applyConsoleAppender), we should make it such that ANY of the defined ConsoleAppender is sufficient (not just the first ConsoleAppender in the list)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

in progress to update from Calcite 1.21 to Calcite 1.35. This currently runs using the rc-3 of Calcite 1.35 at https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/calcite/apache-calcite-1.35.0-rc3 or using a fork of Calcite built locally. To run this do the following\r\n\r\nOn a local calcite fork:\r\nClone the repo:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/gianm/calcite.git \r\n```\r\nand build branch changes-for-druid-update\r\n```\r\n./gradlew clean && ./gradlew build publishToMavenLocal  -x test\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the artifact in https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/calcite/apache-calcite-1.35.0-rc3/, download the tarball, ensure you have Java 8 and gradle 7.6.1/7.6.2 and do the following\r\n```\r\ngradle build\r\ngradle build publishToMavenLocal  -x test\r\n```\r\nThis will publish a local version 1.35.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\nYou'll need to do a full commandline build to regenerate the SQL parser:\r\n```\r\nmvn clean compile -T8\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update:** 1.35 is now available under maven central https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.apache.calcite/calcite-core/1.35.0. The pom.xml has been updated to pick up the calcite jars from maven central\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-30T15:49:08Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:50:28Z","closed_at":"2023-08-11T19:47:16Z","merged_at":"2023-08-11T19:47:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"afe22907a5657426a739f881ca64053ecafb4e01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

This is not possible within the InputSource interface as the TaskToolbox class isn't accessible in its module.\r\n\r\nIt also alters the DruidInputSource to fetch used segments using the RetrieveUsedSegments actions via the overlord when a toolbox is available.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFollow up to #14142 to clean up some additional stuff.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* generic indexed, front-coded, and auto string columns now all share the same column and index supplier implementations\r\n* remove `CachingIndexed` implementation, which I think is largely no longer needed by the switch of many things to directly using `ByteBuffer`, avoiding the cost of creating `String`\r\n* remove `ColumnConfig.columnCacheSizeBytes()` since `CachingIndexed` was the only user\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n`druid.processing.columnCache.sizeBytes` has been removed since it provided limited utility after a number of internal changes. Leaving this config is harmless, but it does nothing.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

is...\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-28T19:29:52Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:50:58Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T22:49:30Z","merged_at":"2023-08-08T22:49:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"667e4dab5e468f5d1732ac3473498d9cb8e339f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

this PR:\r\n- Set the explain plan attributes _after_ the query is prepared,  when we've the finalized output names in `rootQueryRel`. This also gives us the benefit of going through all validation checks in the prepare phase.\r\n- Simplify `resolveClusteredByColumnsToOutputColumns` function for explain attributes as things are already validated and we just have one source list, `rootQueryRel`, containing the output column names; the existing unit tests work right out of the box. Added new unit tests using `JOIN` and `WITH...AS` to prove that the logic no longer depends on individual `SqlNode` types.\r\n- Add a negative ordinal check for clustered by columns as a workaround to Calcite's limitation; added unit tests to validate this.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidSqlParserUtils.java`\r\n * `QueryHandler.java`\r\n *

#13948 druid server initial approach\r\n\r\nPartially - Improves #13948.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a small PR for starting the migration of JUnit4 test to Junit5 test as mentioned in the above open issue. Is a small step Just to not create noise as the current codebase is big enough so not easy managed with massive PRs\r\n\r\n#### Improvements\r\n - Choice of algorithms: Use the existing logic just align it with JUnit5 api\r\n - Behavioral aspects. Error are handled as previously except in some cases which were asserted through an ```assertThrow()``` and in some places Callables were replaced with lambda references\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nImproved: Adopt JUnit5 which is more modular than JUnit4 which is a whole framework. Support for java8+ key features. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `druid-server client cache client test

Motivation for balancing\r\n\r\nWith round robin segment assignment now enabled by default, coordinator runs are fast and clusters are generally well balanced. But as the name suggests, these assignments are round-robin and may be sub-optimal as they are not based on any server/segment-specific strategy.\r\n\r\nSo, in every coordinator run, assignment is immediately followed by balancing to ensure that segments are moved to the most strategic servers to optimize query performance. The balancing decisions are dictated by the strategy being used on the cluster. The most viable and strongly recommended candidate for this is the `cost` balancer strategy. The other two, `cachingCost` and `diskNormalized` were meant to be improvements over `cost` but come with their own set of challenges.\r\n\r\n### Limits of `cost` balancer strategy\r\n\r\nThe segment balancing algorithm is throttled by `maxSegmentsToMove` which has been a way to ensure that the coordinator does not get stuck performing too many cost computations. With the recent coordinator improvements, the upper bound for `maxSegmentsToMove` has now been set at 1000. While this number is good enough for smaller clusters with up to 100k used segments, it poses some problems at larger scales:\r\n\r\n- Moving 1000 segments in each coordinator run may take several hours to attain balance on a large cluster with 1M segments or more.\r\n- With 1M+ segments, even computations for 1000 segments may take several minutes, thus delaying coordinator cycles (typically expected to be every minute).\r\n- Accidentally increasing `maxSegmentsToMove` to higher values (say 5000) has often caused coordinator runs to get stuck for hours, resulting in the entire Druid cluster malfunctioning.\r\n\r\nAs Druid clusters start handling more segments, this problem only gets compounded.\r\n\r\nThus, there is need for improvement in the performance of the `cost` balancer strategy.\r\n\r\n> The `cachingCost` strategy had been contributed with similar goals in mind but it has since deviated in its method of cost computations and has been known to cause issues, often leading to imbalanced clusters.\r\n\r\n### Proposed improvements\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids redundant cost computations by leveraging the following facts:\r\n- The joint cost of two segments depends on\r\n  - their intervals: __A segment of interval `I1` would have exactly the same cost with any segment of interval `I2`__. In other words, computed interval costs can be reused.\r\n  - their datasources: if the segments belong to the same datasource, the cost is simply multiplied by a constant factor of 2\r\n- __The joint cost of two segments is negligible when there is enough gap between their intervals.__ This has also been exploited in `cachingCost` strategy while bucketing segments into compute intervals. `CostBalancerStrategyTest.testJointSegmentsCostWith45DayGap()` also proves such costs to be negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes to `cost` strategy\r\n- In every `ServerHolder`, track the number of segments per datasource per interval\r\n- Perform cost computations for a given interval just once, and then multiply by a constant factor to account for the different datasources and total segment count in that interval\r\n```\r\ncost of segment S of (Datasource1, Interval1) with n segments of (Datasource2, Interval2)\r\n= cost(I1, I2) x n\r\n\r\ncost of segment S of (Datasource1, Interval1) with n segments of (Datasource1, Interval2)\r\n= cost(I1, I2) x n x 2\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Do not perform joint cost computations with segments that are outside the compute interval for the segment being considered for move\r\n```\r\ncost compute interval for segment = [segment start - 45 days, segment end + 45 days)\r\n```\r\n> These are defensive limits, `cachingCost` actually uses 30 days as the compute gap.\r\n\r\n- __Remove metrics `segment/cost/*` as they were coordinator killers!__ Turning on these metrics (by setting `emitBalancingStats` to true) has often caused the coordinator to be stuck for hours. Moreover, they are too complicated to decipher and do not provide any meaningful insight into the a Druid cluster.\r\n- The above metrics have been replaced with simpler metrics to track cost computation time, count and errors.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n- Remove flaky test from `CostBalancerStrategyTest`. No other functional change to this test to ensure that the new strategy works as expected.\r\n- Remove usages of mock `BalancerStrategy` from `LoadRuleTest`\r\n- Clean up `BalancerStrategy` interface\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAll unit tests and simulation tests run successfully with no changes required.\r\n\r\n### Comparison of simulated run times of the `BalanceSegments` duty in seconds. Setup: 200 servers, `maxSegmentsToMove` = 1000, `balancerComputeThreads` = 1\r\n\r\n| Implementation | Features |\r\n|----|----|\r\n| A (current implementation) | none |\r\n| B | reuse computed interval costs |\r\n| C | ignore cost of far intervals |\r\n| D (proposed) | ignore cost of far intervals and reuse computed interval costs |\r\n\r\nTotal segments | Distribution <br/>(intervals x partitions) | A | B | C | D |\r\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n|120,000| 120,000 hrs x 1 | 21.5 | 23.0 | 9.2 | __6.2__ |\r\n|120,000| 1,000 hrs x 120 | 22.5 | __2.5__ | 20.5 | __2.5__ |\r\n|120,000| 6,000 days x 20 | 20.0 | 12.0 | 8.9 | __1.8__ |\r\n|1,200,000<br/>`maxSegmentsToMove = 100`<br/>`balancerComputeThreads = 1`| 6,000 days x 200 | 21.0 | 2.5 | 8.8 | __2.2__ |\r\n|1,200,000<br/>`maxSegmentsToMove = 1000`<br/>`balancerComputeThreads = 4`| 6,000 days x 200 | 72.5 | 6.4 | 28.1 | __6.2__|\r\n|1,200,000<br/>`maxSegmentsToMove = 1000`<br/>`balancerComputeThreads = 4`| 3,000 days x 40 <br/>x 10 datasources | 92.6 | 5.6 | 35.6 | __5.4__|\r\n\r\n### Cluster tests\r\n 🟨 __PENDING__\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nThe `cost` balancer strategy performs much better now and is capable of moving more segments in a single coordinator run. These improvements were made by borrowing ideas from the `cachingCost` strategy.\r\n\r\nThe `cachingCost` strategy itself has been known to cause issues and is now deprecated. It is likely to be removed in future Druid releases and must not be used on any cluster.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This change is adding the exceptions in suppressed. Somehow in ingestion flow, we are getting the Value in coerce as `new byte[0]` with SqlType BIGINT which is throwing the following exceptions. \r\n```Error: Unknown exception Cannot coerce [[B] to BIGINT```\r\n\r\nPeople had hard time in finding out which field is causing the exception while querying. Thus, this change is logging the fieldName along with exception. This will help us identify the issues in the ingestion and we can figure why are we ingesting primitive arrays. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.
