of infer_type and infer_shape were cleaned in frontends. These methods were developed in common.py\r\n1. In general duplicates were observed in pytorch frontend. Wrapper over infer_type is used to write nodes after graph pass to map and reuse them further. Any other frontends do not use such mechanism.\r\n2. Practicaly the result of infer_type is needed in \"checked_type\" method, it was inserted to infer_type.

PR adds support for the Arduino platform to microTVM using the Project API interface. Multiple workflows are supported, including traditional host-driven inference and AutoTVM while also allowing easy generation of example projects for any model given by the user. Five different Arduino boards (including ones with both ARM and ESP32 chips) have been tested, but any compatible board with enough flash and RAM should work.\r\n\r\nSince no suitable Arduino simulator exists, this PR splits its integration tests into those that require hardware and those that don't . `ci-qemu:v0.07` supports building and compiling Arduino projects, but this is all that can be tested on the CI. Users wishing to run the full test suite on attached hardware may pass the `--run-hardware-tests` flag.\r\n\r\n@merdadh @mdw-octoml @areusch @gromero

knob values depended on order of explicit cfg update and cfg.define_split calls in fallback mode\r\n\r\nI.e. schedule depend where and when default KNOB values are defined. I.e. for [dense x8](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/topi/x86/dense.py#L168)6 we define a split space and then if we are in fallback mode, we manually point some heuristic factors. And everything works well. But for batch_matmul x86 we define certain values in case of fallback in [compute func first](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/topi/x86/batch_matmul.py#L74) and only then [in schedule](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/topi/x86/batch_matmul.py#L120) these values will be overwritten by first pair from search space that is (-1,1).\r\n\r\nThis fix makes any order of execution reuse predefined values in fallback

is related to an issue [here](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/tir-const-1-tir-const-true-throws-valueerror/10667). In a word, when `==` and `!=` binary operators are applied to `tir.const(1)` and `tir.const(True)`, the return value will be an \"EQ\" expression instead of a folded `IntImm` variable (e.g., `tir.const(True)` after constant folding). This issue will bring some limitations when integrating TIR to some python native operations (e.g., `==`, `!=`, python sets, etc.).\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm import tir\r\nassert tir.const(1) == tir.const(True)\r\n#  Or: assert tir.const(1, \"int32\").__eq__(tir.const(1, \"uint1\")).__bool__()\r\n# `uint1` means `bool`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that during `BinaryOpMatchTypes` (https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/src/tir/op/op.cc#L145), singed and unsigned variable are not compatible and `IntImmNode` would be converted to `CastNode`. However, TVM's constant folding did not support `CastNode` so that `tir.const(1, \"int32\").__eq__(tir.const(1, \"uint1\"))` would return an expression instead of another folded `IntImm` variable.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed this problem by enhancing the unsigned-signed casting:\r\n\r\nIf the bits of signed type is greater than that of unsigned type, it means that signed type has a bigger value range than that of unsigned type. In this case, we can promote the unsigned type to a signed type so that there's no need to employ `CastNode`.\r\n\r\nA more thorough enhancement would be supporting constant folding for `CastNode`.

AutoScheduler FLOP estimator now mis-estimates the following case to be 0 FLOPS:\r\n```\r\ntir.if_then_else(A[i] > 0, A[i], 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the expression `A[i] > 0` has output dtype

I think the correct fix should be\r\n\r\n```\r\nif isinstance(K, tvm.tir.Any):\r\n    k = te.reduce_axis((0, tvm.tir.floordiv(K, vec)), \"k\")\r\nelse:\r\n    k = te.reduce_axis((0, K // vec), \"k\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow `tvm.tir.Any` is a subclass of `PrimExprWithOp` and performing floordiv with `//` is valid. I think we can remove this wrong fix now.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-09T06:54:14Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T06:04:22Z","closed_at":"2021-08-16T06:04:08Z","merged_at":"2021-08-16T06:04:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"cddd3485dd58c1de98c1279a465897a36782befe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Huyuwei","id":17470319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDcwMzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17470319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei","html_url":"https://github.com/Huyuwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huyuwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jcf94","id":12119698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTE5Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12119698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94","html_url":"https://github.com/jcf94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kevinthesun","id":15520525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTIwNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15520525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinthesun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinthesun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Laurawly","id":3700467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3700467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly","html_url":"https://github.com/Laurawly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Laurawly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avat

Short Summary\r\n\r\nSometimes, when executing CUDA kernels, we might encounter the error `CUDA_ERROR_LAUNCH_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` (e.g., [here](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/cuda-got-error-cuda-error-launch-out-of-resources/4173)). This happens because **the nvcc compiler allocates too many registers per thread**. In the case when we launch the CUDA kernel using too many threads, the GPU will notice that the CUDA kernel requests more registers than what are available on the chip and therefore refuse to launch the kernel.\r\n\r\nThis hence implies that we need a way of telling nvcc what to expect in terms of the number of threads per block. Luckily, the `__launch_bounds__` directive can help us achieve what we want. In this patch, we add `__launch_bounds__` as part of the CUDA code generation procedure. `__launch_bounds__` will be automatically printed if it is detected that the number of threads per block is a constant integer value. Passing this information to nvcc allows it to spill registers if needed, which might hurt performance, but is still better than having a CUDA kernel that is not functional.\r\n\r\n# Q & A\r\n\r\n**Q: Would this affect the AutoTVM and the auto-scheduler submodule?**\r\n\r\nA: No. Although in those cases the number of threads keeps changing at each trial, the number will be set to a constant when it comes to the code generation phase. Furthermore, in the case when the number of threads per block is not a constant, `__launch_bounds__` will simply not be printed.\r\n\r\nAny feedback on this patch is appreciated. @comaniac @icemelon

clean-up, improved argument parsing.  Should have identical behavior to before, with the exception of the following items.  This clean-up is intended to allow for future improvements, such as maintaining separate build directories between the local environment and the docker builds.\r\n\r\nFunctionality changes\r\n\r\n- Added detailed help message, displayed using `-h` or `--help`.\r\n\r\n- Optional flags handled using `getopt`, can now occur in any order.\r\n\r\n- `--mount` flag may occur more than once.\r\n\r\n- Mount the `.tvm_test_data` folder, to avoid re-downloading test data already available in the host environment.\r\n\r\nReadability changes\r\n\r\n- Switched from short arguments to docker-run to long arguments  (e.g. `--volume` instead of `-v`).

utility is designed for users who are prone to snap-shot the relay IR graph on terminal.\r\nThe AST structure format covers basic relay function/expressions such as _Function, Call, Let, Var, GlobalVar, If, Tuple, Constant_ currently.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nA Relay IRModule:\r\n```\r\nx = relay.var(\"x\")\r\ny = relay.const(1)\r\nz = relay.add(x, y)\r\nz = relay.multiply(x, z)\r\nmod = tvm.ir.IRModule().from_expr(z)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n```\r\nviz_res = retv.ASTVisualization()\r\nmod = viz_res(mod)\r\nres = viz_res.get_output()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill be showed as:\r\n```\r\n== The AST view of the IRModule is ==\r\n@main([Var(x)])\r\n   `--(call)\r\n      |--multiply\r\n      |--x\r\n      `--(call)\r\n         |--add\r\n         |--x\r\n         `--1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is welcome to have your thoughts on  the utility.\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

now running the fp16 conversion pass on arange op results in a type error fp16 vs fp32, since we need to update `dtype` attributes of arange

but that would cause a problem when `end` argument is a large number which happens to be fp32. So we should disallow fp16 conversion for arange. Since the inputs to arange are scalars, cast overhead is negligible.\r\n@AndrewZhaoLuo

PR introduce a new implementation of linear congruential engine and its test. This linear congruential engine is a drop-in replacement for and strictly corresponds to `std::minstd_rand` but designed to be serializable and strictly reproducible. Specifically implemented for meta schedule but also reusable for other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe main differences are as follows:\r\n1. The random engine is stateless and its state is managed by the outside environment via a pointer to an `int64_t` variable. Therefore, the state of the random engine can be serialized as a single `int64_t`.\r\n2. The random engine's result is strictly reproducible, i.e, given a seed we can always reproduce the same tuning result.\r\n3. The randomness is still preserved because it's implemented as a linear congruential engine, with the same parameter setup as `std::minstd_rand`.\r\n4. It's platform-independent.","created_at":"2021-08-04T01:51:48Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T00:09:59Z","closed_at":"2021-08-06T00:07:46Z","merged_at":"2021-08-06T00:07:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc5da054dae9c045f16b12dc5dec90304aca3f4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent

the number of cores for scripts and builds that run inside the RVM\r\nbased on the specified number of cores for the VM.\r\n\r\nCurrently Vagrant doesn't set env. variable TVM_CI_NUM_CORES with the\r\nnumber of cores available in the VM created by Vagrant, as a consequence\r\nthe scripts and builds (like the ones used to build TVM and QEMU) that\r\nrun inside the VM after it is created will use the default number of\r\nonly 2 CPUs, so not using the full CPU resources available in the VM,\r\nin case there are more than 2 cores available.\r\n\r\nThis commit sets TVM_CI_NUM_CORES equal to the number of cores available\r\nin the VM created by Vagrant so the builds (which use that environment\r\nvariable to find out the number of CPUs that must be used for the\r\nbuilds) can use all the CPUs available, speeding up the builds.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

Accidentally disabled the ONNX unit tests on CPU, and since then we've had a few regressions creep in. We've been attempting to enable the ONNX tests in a CPU only job at #8390 , but we've hit issues with pytorch in the CPU docker image. \r\n\r\nThis PR instead refactors the onnx test file to use the `parametrize_targets` flow.\r\nit\r\n1) adds that decorator to every test\r\n2) inlines helper functions that are only used in one test as closures\r\n3) removes the for loops over enabled targets so pytest will run every test on each target individually\r\n4) removes -m gpu from the invocation of the pytest call in CI\r\n\r\nThis will re-enable a bunch of tests that have been disabled in CI and allow us to more easily skip tests that fail only on one target.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\ncc @electriclilies @Lunderberg @tkonolige @jwfromm @masahi \r\n\r\nP.S.

PR adds support for non-scalar zero point values in qnn conv2d operators and also allows the kernel zero points to be channel-wise. This is a needed change to support ONNX's `ConvInteger` nodes which typically treat zero points as expressions and are often generated using OnnxRuntimes quantization feature, that produces channel wise zero points. Although the rest of the qnn framework doesn't yet support non constant zero points, this is a good start that improves our onnx coverage considerably. \r\n\r\nI also found that although qnn supported lowering uint8 convolution and dense to cuda, the dp4a instruction actually only supports int8 datatypes, an error exposed by the onnx frontend tests.

commit fixes the platform argument order for base-box-tool.py\r\n'test' command in the documentation about the RVM. Currently the\r\ndocumentation places '<platform>' before option\r\n'[--test-device-serial=<serial>]', whilst the correct order is after all\r\nthe options, so trying to use the 'test' command arguments in the order\r\nsuggested by the documentation will not work.\r\n\r\nThis commit also fixes a typo (inovke -> invoke).\r\n\r\nFinally it tweaks a bit the text format: lines with maximum 80 columns,\r\na better diagram format for the dir structure, and a better format for\r\nthe bash commands. A link is added too for easy access to the\r\n\"microTVM Reference VM tutorial\" found in tutorials/micro dir.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

boards passed to base-box-tool.py needs to be a subset of\r\nplatform boards support by 'tests/micro/zephyr --microtvm-platforms='.\r\n\r\nCurrently base-box-tool.py only accepts the 'stm32f746xx' ST board,\r\nwhich is not supported by 'tests/micro/zephyr --microtvm-platforms='. As\r\na consequence if one passes '--microtvm-platform=stm32f746xx' to\r\nbase-box-tool.py the 'tests/micro/zephyr' test will fail.\r\n\r\nThat commmit fixes it by adding two new platforms to base-box-tool\r\n('stm32f746xx_nucleo' and 'stm32f746xx_disco') which are supported by\r\ntests/micro/zephyr and by removing the nonexistent 'stm32f746xx'\r\nplatform. The new platform boards are quite similar and share the same\r\nUSB vID and pID.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

cell was unified and transferred to common place for all frontends. Here it is simultaneously used by onnx and pytorch frontends of TVM. LSTM cell was analyzed and modified to remove excess memory and other manipulations which potentially can not be fixed by compiler on its side. Performance tests for different modification of LSTM before and after were carried out. The results are collected in the tables:\r\n\r\nTable 1. Average time per run (microsec) for 10000 runs.

Suffix \"dev\" means implementation in this patch. We had strong difference for performance between implementation on onnx and pytorch without tuning (onnx one is slower). With tuning onnx implementation was slightly worse than pytorch. This patch fixed performance differences for LSTM with tuning and imporved results without tuning for both onnx and pytorch. \r\n\r\nTable 2. Average time per run (ms) for 1000 runs.

continues the work outlined in  \r\n[TECompiler: Rewrite existing compile engine to match updated compiler flow](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-relay-tecompiler-rewrite-existing-compile-engine-to-match-updated-compiler-flow/9233) to centralize the TE->TIR lowering logic into a single IRModule->IRModule transformation. This gets about halfway there for the Interpreter:\r\n - Remove direct access to TECompiler from interpreter, and instead call tec::LowerTEExpr when 'preparing' a module and expression for evaluation.\r\n - Make clear there's no phase distinction between create_interpreter and evaluate on the Python side -- both must be prepared together as a single IRModule.\r\n - But in return make sure the result of evaluate on the Python side is a packed func ready to directly apply 'simple' arguments to an already interpreted closure.\r\n - The interpreter builds and caches primitive TIR functions (and their corresponding dynamic shape functions) as packed funcs as they are encountered.\r\n - Clean uses of interpreter for constant folding on the C++ side.\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n - Fold LoweredModule into IRModule so tec::LowerTEExpr is just another pass.\r\n - Get rid of the implicit caching of lowered functions in TECompiler.\r\n - Make calling convention from Relay to TIR explicit, and remove all the function attribute hackery currently needed so the interpreter can correctly invoke lowered functions as it encounters them.\r\n - Make TECompiler private. Though could do this now it will make migrating the VM and AOT uses of CompilerEngine harder.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-30T00:11:42Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T00:21:33Z","closed_at":"2021-08-17T23:41:42Z","merged_at":"2021-08-17T23:41:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"c8a6089073ba997375b318c80674cc906df19e53","assignee":{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user

inside a block allow users to mark a subregion of the source buffer into a new target buffer. In the following example it does the same job as `A[i, j] = 1`\r\n```Python\r\nwith block([128, 128]) as [i, j]:\r\n    A0 = tir.match_buffer(A[i, j], ())\r\n    A0[()] = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nA further step, it is useful for opaque access (e.g. Tensor intrinsic). It can narrow the access region, also provide some additional information, such as strides and shape for buffer after the pass `CompactBuffer`.
