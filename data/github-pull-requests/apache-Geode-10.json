and `AvailablePortHelper` have methods to retrieve an\n\"available\" port from the membership port range. This feature is both\nunnecessary and inherently unreliable.\n\nINHERENTLY UNRELIABLE\n\nThe default membership port range overlaps each OS's ephemeral port\nrange. An ephemeral port deemed to be \"available\" by one of these\nmethods can be put into use by another process even before the method\nreturns. It is not safe to rely on such a port to remain available after\nit is checked.\n\nUNNECESSARY\n\nCurrently the only callers that request ports from the membership port\nrange are two tests in `DistributedSystemDUnitTest`. In each case, the\ntest uses the returned ports to *set* the membership port range for a\nmember. There is no need for the ports to come from any particular\nrange.\n\nThere are no other uses of this feature, either in the product or in\ntests.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nRemove the \"membership port range\" feature from `AvailablePort` and\n`AvailablePortHelper`.\n\nChange `DistributedSystemDUnitTest` to get available ports from the\n\"available port range.\" This range is safe to use (assuming all other\nconcurrently-running tests are well-behaved).\n","created_at":"2021-10-12T20:27:19Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T23:47:30Z","closed_at":"2021-10-14T23:47:25Z","merged_at":"2021-10-14T23:47:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a6b91717da35b7686c9f8644ead3ac041cf5a33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"echobravopapa","id":18683012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18683012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa","html_url":"https://github.com/echobravopapa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2387116680,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg3MTE2Njgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"4d86eb","default":false,"description":"add

can already add the `windows` label to a PR to also run the Windows tests.  With this enhancement, now you can add a `jdk8` label to also run [the rest of] the JDK8 tests (distributed and stress-new always run both 8 and 11)\r\n\r\nNote: if you add both the `windows` and `jdk8` labels, the result will be the sum of the two separately, i.e. it will include Linux JDK11, Windows JDK11, and Linux JDK8 (but not Windows JDK8).  Reasoning: that's probably plenty of coverage for a PR (the remaining quadrant will still be tested in the main pipeline once the PR is merged), and anyway the concourse pr resource we use doesn't support logic \"and\" of multiple tags (only \"or\") so there would have to be a separate label like windowsjdk8 which might just be more confusing than its worth...","created_at":"2021-10-12T05:23:15Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T17:02:37Z","closed_at":"2021-10-12T17:02:25Z","merged_at":"2021-10-12T17:02:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"198cc40a2ba69137251ae5a347b8e925bacfe14e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"smgoller","id":550859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDg1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/550859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller","html_url":"https://github.com/smgoller","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smgoller/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6979/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6979/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6979/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/63e52baf86e6cfc2d688685c8b365d8851747964","head":{"label":"onichols-pivotal:GEODE-9717-enable-self-service-jdk8-pr-checks-via-JDK8-pr-label","ref":"GEODE-9717-enable-self-service-jdk8-pr-checks-via-JDK8-pr-label","sha":"63e52baf86e6cfc2d688685c8b365d8851747964","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114800905,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4MDA5MDU=","name":"geode","full_name":"onichols-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

two fixes removed an errant setter (#6915) and getter (#6972).  This fix removes a factory method that was missed in the first two passes.  All were introduced in 1.15, so removing now before we ship 1.15.0 does not break compatibility with any released version of Geode.\r\n\r\nAdding new methods to a public interface like GatewaySenderFactory is a breaking change for other implementations of this interface. We can consider bringing these only when a new major is proposed (e.g. Geode 2.0).\r\n\r\nThe Geode code that uses this factory method already uses InernalGatewaySenderFactory anyway, so the easiest fix is just to push this down for now.","created_at":"2021-10-12T00:54:16Z","updated_at":"2021-10-12T05:56:17Z","closed_at":"2021-10-12T05:56:06Z","merged_at":"2021-10-12T05:56:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"e8942b794ce9ee9dc9c15320e6936b2d150b2a7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gesterzhou","id":10713950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzEzOTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10713950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou","html_url":"https://github.com/gesterzhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nabarunnag","id":8689859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODk4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8689859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag","html_url":"https://github.com/nabarunnag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"alb3rtobr","id":5363407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjM0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5363407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr","html_url":"https://github.com/alb3rtobr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alb3rtobr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_ad

Removed *FunctionExecutor redis classes.\r\nThe redis \"execute*\" and \"stripedExecute*\" methods are now named \"lockedExecute*\".\r\nCommandExecutors now use the ExecutionHandlerContext to do the lockedExecute calls\r\nand the context has redis data type specific versions (i.e. hash, set, zset, string, data).\r\nNow all the real command implementation code is either in the CommandExecutor or the data structure class.\r\nThe middle layer between the two no longer exists.\r\n\r\nAlso the RedisDataType enum now knows what null RedisData type corresponds to it saving a hashMap lookup or two on each data command.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following

fix #6915 removed the errant setter.  this fix removes the getter. (both were introduced in 1.15, so removing it now before we ship 1.15.0 does not break compatibility with any released version of Geode)\r\n\r\nadding new methods to a public interface like GatewaySender is a breaking change for other implementations of this interface, such as in Spring Data Geode project.  We can consider bringing these only when a new major is proposed (e.g. Geode 2.0)\r\n\r\nAll of the Geode code that uses this getter already uses AbstractGatewaySender anyway, so the easiest fix is just to push this down for now.","created_at":"2021-10-11T18:19:08Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T19:04:01Z","closed_at":"2021-10-11T19:03:58Z","merged_at":"2021-10-11T19:03:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"956db9ce86ec1e93913c3f6feda21b8023de3816","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kohlmu-pivotal","id":11528691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTI4Njkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11528691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/kohlmu-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kohlmu-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gesterzhou","id":10713950,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzEzOTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10713950?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou","html_url":"https://github.com/gesterzhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gesterzhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nabarunnag","id":8689859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODk4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8689859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag","html_url":"https://github.com/nabarunnag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/rec

a server receives a connection request with an unrecognized client\nversion, it sends an informative reply and immediately closes the\nsocket.\n\nIn this situation, the client wants to throw a\n`ServerRefusedConnectionException` with a message that includes the\nserver's informative reply.\n\nOn Windows, when the client attempts to read the server's reply, the\nsocket throws a `SocketException` with the message \"Connection reset\".\nAs a result, the caller never receives the informative\n`ServerRefusedConnectionException`.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nDisable this test on Windows until

some versions of Windows (such as the version we use in CI), the\ngranularity of `System.currentTimeMillis()` is ~15ms.\n\n`PingOpDistributedTest.regularPingFlow()` executes two pings and\nasserts that the resulting heartbeat timestamp to has increased from one\nping to the next.\n\nThe test's two pings often occur so rapidly that the heartbeat\ntimestamps appear to be the same, causing the

changes for GEODE-9139 changed the behavior of\r\n`org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.tcpserver.HostAndPort` to\r\npermanently cache the internal `InetSocketAddress` once it has tried one\r\ntime to resolve the address. This undoes part of the fix introduced by\r\nGEODE-7808, in which `HostAndPort` was created as a way to hold an\r\nunresolved hostname.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the cached `InetSocketAddress` may contain a stale or\r\nunresolved address which will be returned by `getSocketInetAddress` for\r\nthe lifetime of the `HostAndPort`/`InetSocketWrapper` object. This prevents\r\nthe address from being resolved correctly after changes in DNS records.\r\n(Such changes are common in cloud environments.)\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the cached internal `InetSocketAddress` from\r\n`InetSocketWrapper` so that `getSocketInetAddress` will try to resolve the\r\naddress each time it is called with an unresolved address.","created_at":"2021-10-05T23:47:19Z","updated_at":"2021-10-13T17:27:23Z","closed_at":"2021-10-13T17:27:20Z","merged_at":"2021-10-13T17:27:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"b39958fafa8690bb978710018a6ecf2bc56244f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"echobravopapa","id":18683012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18683012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa","html_url":"https://github.com/echobravopapa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6938/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6938/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6938/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/808721aa586b37f8fd15aa378efc8948c6c539e6","head":{"label":"aaronlindsey:GEODE-9666-NoAvailableLocatorsException","ref":"GEODE-9666-NoAvailableLocatorsException","sha":"808721aa586b37f8fd15aa378efc8948c6c539e6","user":{"login":"aaronlindsey","id":1781978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODE5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronlindsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":180627672,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODA2Mjc2NzI=","name":"geode","full_name":"aaronlindsey/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaronlindsey","id":1781978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODE5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1781978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronlindsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronlindsey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aaronlindsey/geode","description":"Apache

is a time gap between credentials are gathered at the client and credentials are examined on the server, if between this time period, credentials expired (rare case, but it does happen a lot during stress tests), client operations will fail during the operations (even after user is authenticated, doing a put/get might need to open new connections and require authentication again). So we should allow \"authenticate\" method also throw AuthExpirationException if they want to give client a chance to retry (only retry once).\r\n\r\nThe PR handles retry from the client side if client receives an `AuthenticationExpiredException`.

 Revert \"Revert \"GEODE-9607: prevent pubsub from running server out of memory (#6880)\" (#6921)\"\r\n    \r\n    This reverts commit 45383f0e562f9ba738858fe91fd38fba9e9a1023.\r\n    \r\nIt also makes the following improvements to that revert:\r\n    1. publish no longer creates extra netty listener objects\r\n    2. publish now writes directly to the netty ByteBuf instead\r\n    of delaying it using a RedisResponse object.\r\n    3. a publisher thread will now loop around and publish another\r\n    batch instead of handing it off to another thread\r\n    4. the batch is now optimized by conflating consecutive publish requests\r\n    on the same channel. This allows them to be written to netty as\r\n    a single message instead of multiple messages\r\n    5.  Added a new PubSubConcurrentDUnitTest\r\n    6. If a publish is going to be sent to multiple netty channels,\r\n    it now writes the message once to a ByteBuf and shares that\r\n    ByteBuf with each channel.\r\n    7. Pattern publish now caches which subscribers match a particular\r\n    publish channel name so that the glob matching does not need\r\n    to be done on each publish.\r\n    Some of the foreach support has been dropped from the pubsub\r\n    manages in favor of getting a Collection of subscriptions so\r\n    that the publish channel writes can be grouped efficiently.\r\n    8. The integration test that was running out of memory before has been scaled down since the reason for the OOM was that publish had been optimized which allowed more requests to be queued on the server and then it would run out of memory. The test was running the lettuce client in the same JVM as the server which will never happen in the real world.\r\n    9. Found a couple of places publish was synchronizing that was not needed.\r\n    \r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

we have two problems that are being dealt with here both in the context of MultiUserAuth.\r\n\r\n1) When we register a new DataSerializer, we should be supplying credentials to enable the registration process to talk to the server.\r\n\r\n2) When we get notified of a new endpoint being up, DataSerializerRecoveryTask is called. In this class we don't have a copy of the auth information which causes a warning and crash.\r\n\r\nPart 1 was fixed by plumbing the credentials down to the point of the registration with the server.\r\n\r\nPart 2 has the problem the there are really two levels of authentication going on. Cluster level and user level.\r\nThe addition of DataSerializers is a cluster level operations. Adding new data is user level.\r\n\r\nAs a first cut, I have the DataSerializerRecoveryTask reach into the system settings and grab the credentials it needs. I am not sure if this is satisfactory. Hence this is not a pull request per se. Just a draft...\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-28T20:45:20Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T23:38:25Z","closed_at":"2021-09-28T23:38:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a9159e66c50f9ef59495cf11bea16dece85d07c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"upthewaterspout","id":857521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout","html_url":"https://github.com/upthewaterspout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/upthewaterspout/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/6912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/6912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/727806825bd6fb52cbe9f92a6cdee7d347785ed6","head":{"label":"mhansonp:bugfix/GEODE-9645","ref":"bugfix/GEODE-9645","sha":"727806825bd6fb52cbe9f92a6cdee7d347785ed6","user":{"login":"mhansonp","id":26558973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU4OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26558973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp","html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":134621698,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzQ2MjE2OTg=","name":"geode","full_name":"mhansonp/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mhansonp","id":26558973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU4OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26558973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp","html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp/geode","description":"Apache

JUnit 5 support to all Geode projects that use `geode-junit`.\n\nThis is a re-do of PR 6740 with the addition of a new parameterized test\nrunner. See the GEODE PARAMS RUNNER section (below) for details.\n\nSTANDARD TEST TASKS\n\nUpdated **./gradle/test.gradle** to configure these standard test tasks\nto use JUnit Platform to run tests:\n- `test` and `repeatUnitTest`\n- `acceptanceTest` and `repeatAcceptanceTest`\n- `distributedTest` and `repeatDistributedTest`\n- `integrationTest` and `repeatIntegrationTest`\n- `performanceTest`\n- `uiTest`\n- `upgradeTest` and `repeatUpgradeTest`\n\nSTANDARD TEST MODULES\n\nUpdated **./geode-junit/build.gradle**:\n- Added `junit-jupiter-api` and `junit-jupiter-params` as API\n  dependencies.\n- Added `junit-jupiter-engine` and `junit-vintage-engine` as\n  implementation dependencies.\n\nThese changes add JUnit 5 support to any source set that depends on\n`geode-junit`, either directly or via `geode-dunit`.\n\nOTHER PROJECTS\n\nAdded `junit-vintage-engine` dependency directly to each project that\nruns tests without `geode-junit` or `geode-dunit`:\n- `geode-common`\n- `geode-concurrency-test`\n- `geode-jmh`\n- `geode-modules`\n- `geode-rebalancer`\n- `static-analysis:pmd-rules`\n\nThese changes **do not** add JUnit 5 support to these projects.\nDevelopers who want JUnit 5 support in these projects can declare\ndependencies on `junit-jupiter-api`, `junit-jupiter-params`, and\n`junit-jupiter-engine`.\n\nSPECIFIC TESTS\n\nChange `ConcurrencyRuleTest` to expect the exception types and exception\nmessages thrown by AssertJ when `opentest4j` is on the classpath.\n\nGEODE PARAMS RUNNER\n\n**Problem:** Geode commonly uses `JUnitParamsRunner` to run\nparameterized tests. This runner is incompatible with JUnit Vintage, the\ntest engine that JUnit 5 uses to run JUnit 4 tests. Specifically:\n- `JUnitParamsRunner` discards `@Category` annotations when describing\n  parameterized tests. JUnit Vintage needs this information to filter\n  tests by category.\n- When JUnit Vintage asks `JUnitParamsRunner` to exclude a parameterized\n  test by name, the runner applies the filter not to the individual\n  tests with parameterizations, but to the suite that the runner created\n  to contain the parameterized tests. The filter fails to exclude\n  parameterized tests.\n\nAs a result of these issues, Geode's Windows Gfsh distributed test CI\njob ends up running hundreds of unwanted tests. Numerous of these fail\non Windows.\n\n**Solution:** Introduce `GeodeParamsRunner`, which extends and adapts\n`JUnitParamsRunner` to be compatible with JUnit Vintage.\n\n**Caveat:** When `GeodeParamsRunner` is asked to exclude a specific\nparameterization of a test method, it excludes *all* parameterizations\nof that test method. This makes it impossible to run a single\nparameterization of a given test method, or to exclude a single\nparameterization. This quirk does not affect any CI jobs, but may\nconfuse a developer who tries to use `--tests` to run a single\nparameterization.\n","created_at":"2021-09-28T20:30:47Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T16:13:12Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T16:06:14Z","merged_at":"2021-09-29T16:06:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc75182ae02bd90f7513cfce30fead6817f7f7b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2387116680,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg3MTE2Njgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"4d86eb","default":false,"description":"add

geode-serialization.\r\n\r\nImplement SanctionedSerializablesService in both geode-core and\r\ngeode-management to remove special case for each in\r\nInternalDataSerializer.\r\n\r\nFix sanctioned serializables support in geode-management and\r\ngeode-apis-compatible-with-redis.\r\n\r\nAdd sanctioned serializables support to geode-serialization and\r\ngeode-pulse.\r\n\r\nAdd sanctioned serializables support to geode-junit and geode-dunit\r\nto simplify writing tests for validate-serializable-objects and prevent\r\nhaving to list out DUnit Rules and other test framework classes when\r\nvalidate-serializable-objects is enabled.\r\n\r\nUse ExecutorServiceRule and reformat json strings in\r\nRestRegionAPIIntegrationTest.\r\n\r\nReorganize QueryCommandDUnitTestBase.\r\n\r\nUse InvalidClassException instead of Exception in\r\nObjectInputStreamFilterWrapper fatal log message.\r\n\r\nImprove assertion messages in ResourceUtils.\r\n\r\nMove loadSanctionedSerializablesServices and loadClassNames to\r\nnew SanctionedSerializables in geode-serialization.\r\n\r\nExclude Pulse GemFireAuthentication from sanctioned serializables.\r\n\r\nAdd SerializationTest Category to all AnalyzeSerializables integration\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nTidy up SANCTIONED_SERIALIZABLES_DEPENDENCIES_PATTERN.\r\n\r\nConvert to AssertJ and use BeforeClass in\r\nInternalDataSerializerSerializationAcceptlistTest.\r\n\r\nNote: If Git or GitHub is showing invalid file renames in the diffs, you\r\nmay need to pull the branch locally and configure diff.renameLimit to\r\nsomething lower than the default value of 50.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit acbd0ff3c37a5e1fe3018d3f7288df385159ac4c)\r\n(cherry picked from commit

(#6878)\r\n\r\nAllow geode modules to have an AnalyzeSerializables integration\r\ntest without implementing SanctionedSerializablesService.\r\n\r\nImprove debugging information for AnalyzeSerializables integration\r\ntests:\r\n- Provide new failure message when no SanctionedSerializablesService\r\nexists.\r\n- Create ANALYZE_SERIALIZABLES.md to provide detailed instructions for\r\nfailures involving AnalyzeSerializables integration tests.\r\n- Reference ANALYZE_SERIALIZABLES.md in failure messages.\r\n\r\nRemove geode-serialization and geode-common jars from geode-pulse\r\n.war file:\r\n- Change getModuleClass() to return Optional.\r\n- Delete PulseSanctionedSerializablesService and its resources.\r\n- Change geode-pulse dependency on geode-serialization

port the fixes for GEODE-9486 to support/1.13:\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGEODE-9486: Fix validate-serializable-objects (#6823)\r\n\r\nRename DistributedSystemService to SanctionedSerializablesService and\r\nremove unused init(DistributedSystem).\r\n\r\nMove SanctionedSerializablesService to geode-serialization.\r\n\r\nImplement SanctionedSerializablesService in both geode-core and\r\ngeode-management to remove special case for each in\r\nInternalDataSerializer.\r\n\r\nFix sanctioned serializables support in geode-management and\r\ngeode-apis-compatible-with-redis.\r\n\r\nAdd sanctioned serializables support to geode-serialization and\r\ngeode-pulse.\r\n\r\nAdd sanctioned serializables support to geode-junit and geode-dunit\r\nto simplify writing tests for validate-serializable-objects and prevent\r\nhaving to list out DUnit Rules and other test framework classes when\r\nvalidate-serializable-objects is enabled.\r\n\r\nUse ExecutorServiceRule and reformat json strings in\r\nRestRegionAPIIntegrationTest.\r\n\r\nReorganize QueryCommandDUnitTestBase.\r\n\r\nUse InvalidClassException instead of Exception in\r\nObjectInputStreamFilterWrapper fatal log message.\r\n\r\nImprove assertion messages in ResourceUtils.\r\n\r\nMove loadSanctionedSerializablesServices and loadClassNames to\r\nnew SanctionedSerializables in geode-serialization.\r\n\r\nExclude Pulse GemFireAuthentication from sanctioned serializables.\r\n\r\nAdd SerializationTest Category to all AnalyzeSerializables integration\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nTidy up SANCTIONED_SERIALIZABLES_DEPENDENCIES_PATTERN.\r\n\r\nConvert to AssertJ and use BeforeClass in\r\nInternalDataSerializerSerializationAcceptlistTest.\r\n\r\nNote: If Git or GitHub is showing invalid file renames in the diffs, you\r\nmay need to pull the branch locally and configure diff.renameLimit to\r\nsomething lower than the default value of 50.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit acbd0ff3c37a5e1fe3018d3f7288df385159ac4c)\r\n(cherry picked from commit

(#6878)\r\n\r\nAllow geode modules to have an AnalyzeSerializables integration\r\ntest without implementing SanctionedSerializablesService.\r\n\r\nImprove debugging information for AnalyzeSerializables integration\r\ntests:\r\n- Provide new failure message when no SanctionedSerializablesService\r\nexists.\r\n- Create ANALYZE_SERIALIZABLES.md to provide detailed instructions for\r\nfailures involving AnalyzeSerializables integration tests.\r\n- Reference ANALYZE_SERIALIZABLES.md in failure messages.\r\n\r\nRemove geode-serialization and geode-common jars from geode-pulse\r\n.war file:\r\n- Change getModuleClass() to return Optional.\r\n- Delete PulseSanctionedSerializablesService and its resources.\r\n- Change geode-pulse dependency on geode-serialization

group-transaction-events is set for a serial\r\ngateway sender there is a small chance that duplicated\r\nevents are sent by the sender.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind is a bug in the serial gateway sender.\r\n\r\nWhen the remove() method of the SerialGatewaySenderQueue\r\nwas invoked for an event that was peeked to complete\r\na transaction, it was also removed from the extraPeekedIds\r\nstructure.\r\nThis provoked that events already peeked, were peeked\r\nagain by SerialGatewaySenderQueue.peekAhead() when\r\nthey should not have been.\r\n\r\nA change has been made in the remove() method so\r\nthat events that were peeked to complete a transaction\r\nare only removed from the extraPeekedIds when a call\r\nto remove() has been made previously for that event\r\n(the events is in extraPeekedIdsRemovedButPreviousIdNotRemoved)\r\nand the previous event is the lastDispatchedKey.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.

a partition redundant region is empty, `status redundancy` command shows a wrong redundancy value for that region.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngfsh>status redundancy\r\nNumber of regions with zero redundant copies = 0\r\nNumber of regions with partially satisfied redundancy = 1\r\nNumber of regions with fully satisfied redundancy = 0\r\n\r\nRedundancy is partially satisfied for regions: \r\n  test redundancy status: NOT_SATISFIED. Desired redundancy is 1 and actual redundancy is 2147483647.\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is in `SerializableRegionRedundancyStatusImpl` class. The `calculateLowestRedundancy` initializes `minRedundancy` variable with `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. But for empty regions, all buckets have redundancy -1, so `minRedundancy` is not modified, and returned with that value.\r\n\r\nI propose to check `minRedundancy` value before returning it.

geode-serialization.\r\n\r\nImplement SanctionedSerializablesService in both geode-core and\r\ngeode-management to remove special case for each in\r\nInternalDataSerializer.\r\n\r\nFix sanctioned serializables support in geode-management and\r\ngeode-apis-compatible-with-redis.\r\n\r\nAdd sanctioned serializables support to geode-serialization and\r\ngeode-pulse.\r\n\r\nAdd sanctioned serializables support to geode-junit and geode-dunit\r\nto simplify writing tests for validate-serializable-objects and prevent\r\nhaving to list out DUnit Rules and other test framework classes when\r\nvalidate-serializable-objects is enabled.\r\n\r\nUse ExecutorServiceRule and reformat json strings in\r\nRestRegionAPIIntegrationTest.\r\n\r\nReorganize QueryCommandDUnitTestBase.\r\n\r\nUse

(#6878)\r\n\r\nAllow geode modules to have an AnalyzeSerializables integration\r\ntest without implementing SanctionedSerializablesService.\r\n\r\nImprove debugging information for AnalyzeSerializables integration\r\ntests:\r\n- Provide new failure message when no SanctionedSerializablesService\r\nexists.\r\n- Create ANALYZE_SERIALIZABLES.md to provide detailed instructions for\r\nfailures involving AnalyzeSerializables integration tests.\r\n- Reference ANALYZE_SERIALIZABLES.md in failure messages.\r\n\r\nRemove geode-serialization and geode-common jars from
