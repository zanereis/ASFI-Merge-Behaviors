What is the purpose of the change\r\nCurrently, when I disable hive table source parallelism inference using configuration  and set parallelism.default: 100. \r\n`table.exec.hive.infer-source-parallelism: false `\r\n`parallelism.default: 100`\r\nThe result is that the parallelism of hive table source is 1, and the configuration of the default parallelism is not effective.\r\n\r\nI will optimize this problem. In the future, when disable hive table source parallelism inference ，the  parallelism of hive table source will be determined according to the following order：\r\n \r\n1. If `table.exec.resource.default-parallelism` is set, the configured value will be used\r\n\r\n2. If `parallelism.default` is set, the configured value is used\r\n\r\n3. If the above two configuration items are not set, the default value is 1\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - `HiveParallelismInference#limit` return parallelism directly when hive table source parallelism inference is disabled\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added integration tests for hive table source parallelism inference is disabled and set parallelism through configuration.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no \r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n##

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\nThe pull request makes the testSimpleNFA non-flaky by not comparing a list with a collection. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Change the type of `expectedPatterns` from List to Collection, which is consistent with the `actualPatterns`.\r\n- Change the `assertEquals` to `assetTrue` to prepare for comparing two `Collection`.\r\n- Use `equals` to compare.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\nBy running the nondex commands before and after fixing the flaky test, I see the order will not matter.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes: HashSet, assertTrue)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nLet the `build_image` in `common_docker.sh` return correct exit code. This will make `retry_times build_image` could work normally.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* [FLINK-24937][e2e] Return correct exit code in build_image\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* All the existing tests should pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR exchanges the self-written YAML parser for `flink-conf.yml` with `snakeyaml`. This has several benefits. For one, it will address issues like FLINK-15358, where the Flink configuration parser erronously considers anything after a '#' as a comment, even when the '#' occurs within a string.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this means that we can support nested YAML keys, such that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nKeyA:\r\n  KeyB:\r\n    KeyC: \"Hello\"\r\n    KeyD: \"World\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\nKeyA.KeyB.KeyC: \"Hello\"\r\nKeyA.KeyB.KeyD: \"World\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nare equivalent configurations, letting users avoid repetition in their config files.\r\n\r\nThirdly, this lets the Flink config loader support any valid YAML (and reject invalid YAML, which the parser was previously accepting).\r\n\r\n**However, this change could result in breaking behaviour**. For one, the old yaml parser read row-by-row and just skipped invalid yaml rows. However, snakeyaml reads the entire document at once and rejects it if any invalid yaml files are present, which means that configurations before this change would be accepted, whereas now they would not.\r\n\r\nA potential way of getting around this might be to read the configuration file line by line as its own yaml document, discarding invalid ones, but this would mean that we wouldnt be able to have the nested keys structure outlined above.\r\n\r\nHowever, the nested key structure can also introduce problems. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhigh-availability: zookeeper\r\nhigh-availability.storageDir: hdfs://flink/ha\r\nhigh-availability.zookeeper.quorum: localhost:2181\r\nhigh-availability.zookeeper.client.acl: open\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould not be written as\r\n\r\n```\r\nhigh-availability: zookeeper\r\nhigh-avilability:\r\n    storageDir: hdfs://flink/ha\r\n    zookeeper:\r\n        quorum: localhost:2181\r\n        client.acl: open\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs this would mean that the `high-availability: zookeeper` key would be overwritten.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *The YAML parser for the global `flink-conf.yml` file now uses `snakeyaml`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `GlobalConfigurationTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove deprecated/unused class files in flink-scala module.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\norg.apache.flink.api.scala.typeutils.ScalaOptionSerializerConfigSnapshot\r\norg.apache.flink.api.scala.typeutils.ScalaTrySerializerConfigSnapshot\r\norg.apache.flink.api.scala.typeutils.TraversableSerializerConfigSnapshot\r\n\r\n \r\nThese class files were tagged with 'Deprecated' in beginning of the year 2019 and were not referenced by other class files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nKubernetes labels have a maximum length of 63 characters. We generate a variety of labels by applying suffixes and prefixes to represent certain components. Previously they have often exceeded the maximum length because the label generation happened by just concatenating strings together. This PR aims to provide a safe mechanism for the label creation that also keeps the documentation up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduced KubernetesLabel enum with helper methods for label generation\r\n  - Updated docs to always include the current maximum length\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n - AbstractKubernetesParametersTest#testClusterIdLengthLimitation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes - kubernetes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17758\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-17T09:30:48Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T09:08:26Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T09:08:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92b0d3a639c004a4a1b94d39ce3beb5d959f66c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17818/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17818/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17818/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d4a68e7a626463d81df6315e622551106588cf8e","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-24800-release-1.13","ref":"flink-24800-release-1.13","sha":"d4a68e7a626463d81df6315e622551106588cf8e","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akalash/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-24802](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24802) Improve cast ROW to STRING\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd a space after the comma when casting ROW to string.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *CastRulesTest.java*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCertain Flink sinks, i.e. RDBMs will not accept rows where there are string values which length exceeds the `precision` defined for the corresponding column type, (e.g. `VARCHAR(20)`). Previously, there was no check in place, and such records would simply cause errors, possibly bringing down the whole pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Create a new `ConstraintValidator` operator that implements the existing NOT NULL constraint for sinks\r\n - Implement the new CHAR/VARCHAR length validator inside this new operator\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded `org.apache.flink.table.planner.runtime.stream.table.TableSinkITCase#testCharPrecisionEnforcer`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **YES**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a few commits which aim to slowly improve the code quality in Flink UI by improving type safety and various smaller fixes. With the exception of the last commit all changes are non-functional, and the last commit only fixes a bug which causes an error in the browser console.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds `angular-testing-library` which will make writing tests in the future easier.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee individual commits.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFlink UI doesn't yet have tests. I added a couple here due to the addition of `angular-testing-library`, but we need to add more tests, of course.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix the wrong results of the IN opreator. The reason behind is it uses the type of the first element in the SEARCH argument as the type of the other elements. It may change the value of the other elements. For example, it may rightPad\r\nthe char element if the common type has larger size. Therefore, it recommends to use `RelDataTypeFactory` to calculate the least restrictive type for all types.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix the wrong results of the IN opreator. The reason behind is it uses the type of the first element in the SEARCH argument as the type of the other elements. It may change the value of the other elements. For example, it may rightPad\r\nthe char element if the common type has larger size. Therefore, it recommends to use `RelDataTypeFactory` to calculate the least restrictive type for all types.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

change log\r\n\r\nThere are various situations during timeout. These stacks should not be blocked. One possible reason is that the timeout time is too short.\r\nFor example: in https://dev.azure.com/apache-flink/apache-flink/_build/results?buildId=23629&view=logs&j=3d12d40f-c62d-5ec4-6acc-0efe94cc3e89&t=4cf71635-d33f-53ff-7185-c5abb11ae3a0&l=14505\r\nThere is only memory computation in org.apache.flink.table.planner.runtime.stream.FsStreamingSinkITCaseBase.$anonfun$check$1(FsStreamingSinkITCaseBase.scala:137), no blocker.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSee unstable tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPort to string casting logic to the new `CastRule` stack\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a method in `CastRule` to define explicitly if the rule can fail or not. Then adapted the `ScalarOperatorGens` runtime to make sure `CAST` doesn't fail when the rule can fail (as temporary fix before https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24385 is worked out)\r\n- Added to string cast rules\r\n  * Modified some methods in parsing logic for numerics and dates to make sure they fail when the conversion can't be performed. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test cases to `CastRulesTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix comment typos in `AsyncIOExample.java`\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nillustrates -> illustrate\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-15T15:10:18Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T11:08:20Z","closed_at":"2022-05-10T11:08:20Z","merged_at":"2022-05-10T11:08:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"c47fc1cb95dea8c34dd093b54bb65025f0b91d27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/01954788ef1c6d5265b74c872c9357cd0b4cc0be","head":{"label":"hililiwei:hotfix-01","ref":"hotfix-01","sha":"01954788ef1c6d5265b74c872c9357cd0b4cc0be","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":248400647,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDg0MDA2NDc=","name":"flink","full_name":"hililiwei/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nModify the last paragraph of the dev/stream/operators/asyncio.html.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21639\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-15T15:04:12Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T13:02:19Z","closed_at":"2021-11-22T10:33:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0beaef67e11c75ed6a5cebda0702ed3be54f9146","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"alpinegizmo","id":43608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo","html_url":"https://github.com/alpinegizmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alpinegizmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/29658657c2cad8a559fc1e9ea9a5a76c2beb8c23","head":{"label":"hililiwei:FLINK-21639","ref":"FLINK-21639","sha":"29658657c2cad8a559fc1e9ea9a5a76c2beb8c23","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":248400647,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDg0MDA2NDc=","name":"flink","full_name":"hililiwei/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR fixes the handling of the remaining mails on afterInvoke call*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *MailboxProcessor#drain process the recursive mails(mails produced by current mails in the queue) as well *\r\n  - *Closing the mailbox only after it drains all mails including recursive ones*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added a couple of tests in StramTaskTest and MailboxProcessorTest*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-15T14:53:17Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T14:26:51Z","closed_at":"2021-11-30T14:26:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6331a2a6506b59de005258e4153d15017a34d82a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17796/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17796/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17796/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bd21067aaa801072a6672e16a34348fe69eab604","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-24846","ref":"flink-24846","sha":"bd21067aaa801072a6672e16a34348fe69eab604","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akalash/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pull request allows JSON functions to be interpreted in Chinese. This makes it more friendly for engineers from China, as well as easier to use.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n Change the English part in /data/sql_functions_zh.yml under flink project to Chinese.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)docs \r\n","created_at":"2021-11-14T13:20:10Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T03:44:29Z","closed_at":"2022-03-29T03:44:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f30966eb40810a20d8f27557747ca800bac6cc6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cc368b3f669d6504aa779b22116ed41263f10612","head":{"label":"MonsterChenzhuo:master11","ref":"master11","sha":"cc368b3f669d6504aa779b22116ed41263f10612","user":{"login":"MonsterChenzhuo","id":60029759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDI5NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60029759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/MonsterChenzhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":359701695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTk3MDE2OTU=","name":"flink","full_name":"MonsterChenzhuo/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MonsterChenzhuo","id":60029759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDI5NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60029759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/MonsterChenzhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MonsterChenzhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MonsterChenzhuo/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd `renameFunction()` to Catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add `renameFunction()` to interface `Catalog.java`\r\n- Add implementations in `GenericInMemoryCatalog.java`, `AbstractJdbcCatalog.java`, `HiveCatalog.java`\r\n- Add unit tests in `CatalogTests.java`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to `CatalogTests.java` to cover new function.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nHigh-volume Kinesis consumers can sporadically get Connect errors when connecting to the Kinesis endpoint.\r\nCurrent behavior is to consider this a fatal error, causing Flink to roll back to previous checkpoint. However retries will typically lead to success, so this patch causes connect errors to be considered recoverable.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Make ConnectTimeoutException recoverable\r\n- Unit test for above\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- New unit test\r\n- Applying this patch has allowed one of our Flink jobs to run continuously, instead of failing several times per day.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager

threshold into more expected way\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17737\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-12T12:37:22Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T07:36:24Z","closed_at":"2021-11-15T07:36:24Z","merged_at":"2021-11-15T07:36:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"822864494b72c3b349def82a0ff1be42190deb41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17780/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17780/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17780/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/35253cc388fe6d10d56d5505fa8f56a27ea3bada","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-24690-release-1.14","ref":"flink-24690-release-1.14","sha":"35253cc388fe6d10d56d5505fa8f56a27ea3bada","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akalash/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, `RpcEndpointTest.testCallAsyncTimeout` submits a task that is expected to time out,\r\nbut the timeout is not guaranteed: the time the main thread sleep can still be less than the\r\nother thread waits for it for timeout.\r\n\r\nThis change makes the main thread to wait for a signal (latch) to enforce timeout\r\n(the signel is only sent when the test finishes).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the relevant metadata from `FileStatus` in `FileSourceSplit` and then allows users to read them using the metadata feature of `FileSystemTableSource`. This closes https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-19903.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Add modification time and file size to `FileSourceSplit`\r\n* Expose modification time, file size and filename as metadata of `FileSystemTableSource`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new IT test to check the new metadata are extracted properly.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC.

PR depends on: #17179 to use `SharedStateStrategy` in `CompletedCheckpointStore`.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPrevent JM from deleting state when a checkpoint is aborted.\r\nFor that, reference counts in `SharedStateStrategy` are replaced with `latestUsingCheckpointID`.\r\nPlease see JIRA description for more details: FLINK-24611.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- Added `CheckpointCoordinatorTest.testSharedStateNotDiscaredOnAbort` to cover the end goal scenario\r\n- Existing tests: `CheckpointCoordinatorTest`, `DefaultCompletedCheckpointStoreTest`, `IncrementalRemoteKeyedStateHandleTest`;\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Copied from #17179 (please ignore it in review):\r\n`[FLINK-24086][checkpoint] Rebuilding the SharedStateRegistry only when

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nInternally, Kafka translates the periods in topic names to underscore.\r\nThis led to that Flink could not collect the metrics and logged a\r\nwarning. With this commit, we also translate the topic name before trying\r\nto collect the metrics.\r\n\r\nThis PR subsumes #17401 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Translate the periods in topic names to underscore for metric collection\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added a test to verify the log collection of a topic containing periods\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFileSystem compaction should throw unsupported exception in at-least-once mode\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24272\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nWhen checkpointing modu  is at-least-once and auto compaction  is turned on, throw exception in filesystem table sink.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-12T05:56:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:42:01Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273335481,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM1NDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/FileSystem","name":"component=Connectors/FileSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17770/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17770/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17770/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/12926b105ef9f99a05dd1dd334baf8cdeea62f70","head":{"label":"hililiwei:FLINK-24272","ref":"FLINK-24272","sha":"12926b105ef9f99a05dd1dd334baf8cdeea62f70","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":248400647,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDg0MDA2NDc=","name":"flink","full_name":"hililiwei/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR clarifies the `DecodingFormat` architecture, clarifying the role of the `physicalDataType` in `createRuntimeDecoder`, splitting the projection ability in another interface called `ProjectableDecodingFormat`. For more details, check out the javadoc included in this PR which goes through the differences and how to implement and use it.\r\n\r\nIt also applies the change to most of the formats we support today, which implicitly assumed (before this PR) that `DecodingFormat` included projected fields. The changes to `FileSystemTableSource` shows a correct usage of the new interfaces. This PR tries to address the changes to formats in a best effort manner. If formats code can be improved even further thanks to this refactor of `DecodingFormat`, I suggest we tackle it separately.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Clarify `DecodingFormat` and introduce `ProjectableDecodingFormat`.\r\n* Introduce `ProjectedRowData` and `Projection` to simplify implementations of connectors that needs to deal with projections\r\n* Apply the changes to most of the formats and connectors we have.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe PR includes unit tests for `ProjectedRowData` and `Projection`. Changes to `FileSystemTableSource` and to formats are already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? not really, the feature was already there but it was not properly documented\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? JavaDocs\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-11T14:56:51Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T08:43:22Z","closed_at":"2021-11-17T15:51:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d999a005eaad7a24127d698ce9919866dc80b1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17768/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17768/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17768/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/565e4686ad92df005bf786296c60056c910c1503","head":{"label":"slinkydeveloper:FLINK-24776","ref":"FLINK-24776","sha":"565e4686ad92df005bf786296c60056c910c1503","user":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":403633406,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDM2MzM0MDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"slinkydeveloper/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper/flink","description":"Apache

timeout disabling test\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17758\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCreating KafkaSource like this:\r\n```\r\n\r\nval props = new Properties()\r\nprops.put(\"bootstrap.servers\", \"localhost:9092\")\r\nprops.put(\"group.id\", \"group1\")\r\nprops.put(\"auto.offset.reset\", \"latest\")\r\nval kafkaSource = KafkaSource.builder[String]()\r\n      .setProperties(props)\r\n      .build()\r\n```\r\nThe actually used value for \"auto.offset.reset\" is \"earliest\" instead of configured \"latest\".\r\nThis occurs because \"auto.offset.reset\" gets overridden by startingOffsetsInitializer.getAutoOffsetResetStrategy().name().toLowerCase(). The default value for startingOffsetsInitializer is \"earliest\".\r\n\r\nThis behavior is misleading.\r\n\r\nThis behavior imposes an inconvenience on configuring the Kafka connector. We cannot use the Kafka setting \"auto.offset.reset\" as-is. Instead we must extract this particular setting from other settings and propagate to KafkaSourceBuilder.setStartingOffsets():\r\n\r\n```\r\nval kafkaSource = KafkaSource.builder[String]()\r\n      .setProperties(props)\r\n      .setStartingOffsets(\r\n        OffsetsInitializer.committedOffsets(\r\n          OffsetResetStrategy.valueOf(\r\n            props.get(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG)\r\n              .asInstanceOf[String]\r\n              .toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT)\r\n          )\r\n        )\r\n      )\r\n      .build()\r\n```\r\nThe expected behavior is to use the value of \"auto.offset.reset\" provided by KafkaSourceBuilder.setProperties() - unless overridden via KafkaSourceBuilder. setStartingOffsets().\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24851\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-11T12:51:19Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T18:58:02Z","closed_at":"2023-10-11T18:58:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"621644b86520b2b37048ed2169c123fd68de2404","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/750a25b07130ffff84aa839d9012c4689a91a262","head":{"label":"hililiwei:FLINK-24851","ref":"FLINK-24851","sha":"750a25b07130ffff84aa839d9012c4689a91a262","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":248400647,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDg0MDA2NDc=","name":"flink","full_name":"hililiwei/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe dropdown menu introduced by [FLINK-21867](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21867) was not visualized due to missing imports. This issue is not present on `master`. It got fixed already as part of [903185d72c](https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/903185d72c#diff-b076916fff7fedff49389f5a54ec236ef413a1a43bc6a7b95406266d9fb12fe7R31). I added missing Modules to the imports to fix that.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Adds tooltip, select and icon modules\r\n* Updates the corresponding HTML code accordingly\r\n\r\n## Verifying

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPreviously, sinks built using the unified sink framework were missing the `timestamp`\r\nfrom the `StreamRecord` when used with `TableAPI`. Introduce a new Operator which sets\r\nthe timestamp to each `StreamRecord` from the corresponding field of each row.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added integration test `org.apache.flink.table.planner.runtime.stream.sql.DataStreamJavaITCase#testTimestampOperator`\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-10T17:16:17Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T09:26:28Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T08:58:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4f01f9dedac178e39d25cc44e618bc13f3702c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273210700,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjEwNzAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Common","name":"component=Connectors/Common","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17759/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17759/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17759/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/517c928c04f2f1d0bbe3077c500a2330e8bcba74","head":{"label":"matriv:FLINK-24608","ref":"FLINK-24608","sha":"517c928c04f2f1d0bbe3077c500a2330e8bcba74","user":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402329680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDIzMjk2ODA=","name":"flink","full_name":"matriv/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"matriv","id":5058131,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTgxMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5058131?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv","html_url":"https://github.com/matriv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matriv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/matriv/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR fixes the testDisablingBufferTimeout assert condition*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Checked the OutputFlusher thread existing rather than data flushing event detection*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt is test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-10T17:03:47Z","updated_at":"2021-11-11T13:40:09Z","closed_at":"2021-11-11T13:40:09Z","merged_at":"2021-11-11T13:40:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"23e8c8ce62e50d478cb55bee2288a4a35af83d4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7fbfb86da2b45d69cd58b7c259468ea312048ea5","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-24800","ref":"flink-24800","sha":"7fbfb86da2b45d69cd58b7c259468ea312048ea5","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akalash/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBefore this commit, some serializers handled the version information\r\nincorrectly in the corresponding serializer snapshot which could lead\r\nduring eager instantiation that the wrong version of the serializer\r\nwas used to deserialize the data.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Reenable serializer upgrade tests to **always** test serialization and restoration\r\n  - Update all serializers that were handling the version incorrectly\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Updated tests are all passing\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-10T13:54:58Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T14:10:51Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T14:10:51Z","merged_at":"2021-11-24T14:10:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"601ef3b3bce040264daa3aedcb9d98ead8303485","assignee":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17755/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17755/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17755/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/df0a363ef1ee99ca849a493c77a5969169a7a32e","head":{"label":"fapaul:FLINK-24858","ref":"FLINK-24858","sha":"df0a363ef1ee99ca849a493c77a5969169a7a32e","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul/flink","

Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIdeally, in case of cache miss for a key, or with null value fetch for key, key shouldn't be cached, however empty result query should also be in the scope, so including an extra optional parameter to configure same\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nempty check on row list will make sure for database read for empty data for the key\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial check / code fix without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no**/ don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-10T13:48:10Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T03:56:41Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T03:56:40Z","merged_at":"2021-11-24T03:56:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8fdb6713a9264691a10afe3e6e9ff6bcdc86ae1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278775149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc1MTQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/JDBC","name":"component=Connectors/JDBC","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17754/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17754/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17754/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/20ea72fdf316afb968e2d35b1e71a8ab9d8f12b7","head":{"label":"gaurav726:FLINK-24861","ref":"FLINK-24861","sha":"20ea72fdf316afb968e2d35b1e71a8ab9d8f12b7","user":{"login":"gaurav726","id":26005141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDA1MTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26005141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726","html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav726","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d3b278e9ddcf149bd7418f0da7f9e90be252b0ae","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-10T11:31:59Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T13:37:56Z","closed_at":"2021-11-10T13:37:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d329f588d2f8d88a31f4c1d5f159b26ffa0c1d49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17751/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17751/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17751/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fdaf5515627b4906b1465c2aed1ad9a4c8dd3489","head":{"label":"gaurav726:gaurav726-mysql-cache","ref":"gaurav726-mysql-cache","sha":"fdaf5515627b4906b1465c2aed1ad9a4c8dd3489","user":{"login":"gaurav726","id":26005141,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDA1MTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26005141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726","html_url":"https://github.com/gaurav726","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaurav726/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1a4393412d35585a7aee21dd1e7c2e1283a361f3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nNow, only supports yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss, we can add a new time-extractor kind to support yyyyMMdd in a single partition field\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24758\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. add partition.time-extractor.formatter-pattern to allow user to speify DateTimeFormatter\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE MyUserTable (\r\n  column_name1 INT,\r\n  column_name2 STRING,\r\n  ...\r\n  part_name1 INT,\r\n  part_name2 STRING\r\n) PARTITIONED BY (part_name1, part_name2) WITH (\r\n  'connector' = 'filesystem',           -- required: specify the connector\r\n  ...\r\n  'partition.time-extractor.formatter-pattern' = 'yyyyMMdd',\r\n  ...\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\norg.apache.flink.table.planner.runtime.stream.FsStreamingSinkITCaseBase#testBasicDate\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-10T11:09:41Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T04:39:24Z","closed_at":"2022-01-07T03:52:54Z","merged_at":"2022-01-07T03:52:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"c66720ae9fda223b9236aad0fa3b0eaf7a57831b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273335481,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM1NDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/FileSystem","name":"component=Connectors/FileSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d46d83cb0cf1729760a28f81baf07de802a1ff40","head":{"label":"hililiwei:FLINK-24758","ref":"FLINK-24758","sha":"d46d83cb0cf1729760a28f81baf07de802a1ff40","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":248400647,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDg0MDA2NDc=","name":"flink","full_name":"hililiwei/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR ignores testDisablingBufferTimeout test.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Ignored testDisablingBufferTimeout*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt is test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nReorganize print utilities in table-common. The idea of this PR is to make sure printing now is executed using the new `CastRule`s introduced by FLINK-24684 and encapsulate all the `PrintUtils` logic in specific classes enclosing all the parameters required for printing.\r\n\r\nThe first commit shows the new code organization, while the second commit shows how the new classes are used, and it also removes the old `PrintUtils` class.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Introduce `RowDataToStringConverter` and `RowDataToStringConverterImpl` to use the new casting rules for printing fields\r\n* Introduce `PrintStyle` and implementations to encapsulate `RowDataToStringConverter` and other printing variables. Both `TableauStyle` and `RawContentStyle` are composed by logic took from `PrintUtils`, removing the old fields to string casting and replacing it with `RowDataToStringConverter`\r\n* Replaced all the old usages of `PrintUtils` with the new `PrintStyle`\r\n* Removed `PrintUtils`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo new test has been included, since everything is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new

threshold into more expected way\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR fixes the calculation of reaching the buffer debloat threshold*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Buffer debloat threshold calculates more expected*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added one more test for BufferDebloater*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-09T14:07:18Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T07:36:35Z","closed_at":"2021-11-15T07:36:34Z","merged_at":"2021-11-15T07:36:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c82d0b2c5fce2d1bdea61cbc5d713e10945d44f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17737/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17737/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17737/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c45d7bee74218d2b981ebf2980888b0f34be3d6c","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-24690","ref":"flink-24690","sha":"c45d7bee74218d2b981ebf2980888b0f34be3d6c","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akalash/flink","description":"Apache

view has not created yet\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*The second part of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17663 that ignores buffer size announcement when subpartition view has not been created yet. Currently, it is the just hotfix that helps to avoid NPE, but the initial problem will be fixed here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24328 *\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Ignoring the buffer size announcement if subpartition view has not been created yet.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThere is no new test.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?
