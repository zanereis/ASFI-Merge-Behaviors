Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11834](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11834) Moves Riemann and HBase 1.1.2 bundles to optional build profiles named `include-riemann` and `include-hbase1_1_2`. This change is necessary for the NiFi 1 support branch to avoid exceeding the maximum binary size of 1.5 GB for the nifi-assembly.\r\n\r\nThe HBase 1.1.2 bundle has been removed from the main branch, but the Riemann bundle is still available, so this change could be carried forward to the main branch with just the Riemann bundle changes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10728](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10728) Upgrades Apache Derby dependencies from 10.14.2.0 to [10.16.1.1](https://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10_16_1_1.cgi).\r\n\r\nDerby 10.16.1.1 requires Java 17 or higher so this change is targeted to the main branch.

I examined the underlying Glue client which is much more customizable. I figured out every single way to get a schema from Glue.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSchemaVersionNumber schemaVersionNumber = SchemaVersionNumber.builder()\r\n        //.versionNumber(1L)\r\n        .latestVersion(true)\r\n        .build();\r\n\r\nSchemaId schemaId = SchemaId.builder()\r\n        .registryName(registryName)\r\n        .schemaName(schemaName)\r\n        //.schemaArn(arn)\r\n        .build();\r\n\r\nGetSchemaVersionRequest request = GetSchemaVersionRequest.builder()\r\n        .schemaVersionNumber(schemaVersionNumber)\r\n        .schemaId(schemaId)\r\n        //.schemaVersionId(schemaVersionId)\r\n        .build();\r\n\r\nGetSchemaVersionResponse schemaVersionResponse = client.getSchemaVersion(request);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- SchemaVersionNumber: versionNumber OR latestVersion, only one can be specified. I can think of a version property with a default value. In case of the default value we just set the latestVersion(true).\r\n\r\n- SchemaId: (registryName and schemaName) OR schemaArn, only one can be specified.\r\n- GetSchemaVersionRequest: (schemaVersionId) OR (schemaVersionNumber and schemaId), only once can be specified.\r\n\r\nSo  we have a few options to retrieve a schema. Currently without modifying lots of code we can only support this option:\r\nschemaVersionNumber, registryName, schemaName (Use 'Schema Name' property)\r\nin case we would like to add the option to retrieve a schema by\r\nARN - we either have to create a new SchemaIdentifier implementation or new SchemaStrategy for AWS Glue\r\nschemaVersionId - we have to change the StandardSchemaIdentifier interface's schemaVersionId type from OptionalLong to Optional<String> or we need to create a new SchemaStrategy for AW Glue\r\n\r\nPlease note that I removed the builder.maxConnections(context.getMaxConcurrentTasks()) when creating the HTTP Client as it's not applicable in ConfigurationContext.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11807](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11807) This PR adds the ExtractRecordSchema processor that will only get the schema from the configured reader and will not alter the incoming FlowFile. Alternatives like ConvertRecord will read and write each record, even if the format is the same for both reader and writer. If the use case is only to extract the schema, ExtractRecordSchema is much more efficient.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11781](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11781) Corrects OIDC username claim to application identity mapping when using optional or fallback claim properties.\r\n\r\nFollowing OIDC refactoring to support refresh tokens for [NIFI-4890](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4890), use of optional or fallback ID Token Claims resulted in runtime access problems. The standard Spring Security Client Registration includes a `userNameAttributeName` property that drives username identity resolution during the login process. This works as expected when the OIDC User Information endpoint always includes the configured claim name, such as `email`. However, this approach does not work when the configured claim name may be absent, requiring optional fallback claim names to be configured.\r\n\r\nThe OpenID Connect 1.0 specification requires the `sub` claim to be present in OIDC User Information that the Identity Provider returns, so changes include setting `sub` as the `userNameAttributeName` to avoid unexpected failures. A new `StandardOidcUserService` extends that Spring Security `OidcUserService` and implements support for using the first available fallback claim from the combination of OIDC User Information and OIDC ID Token Claims. This approach restores the supported behavior from NiFi 1.20.0.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n-

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11714](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11714) Adds a configured Error Handler to the embedded Jetty Server for NiFi, NiFi Registry, and MiNiFi C2 Servers. The configured Error Handler disables writing stack traces to the response stream. This follows the existing implementation within REST resource classes, but applies the approach to errors that Jetty handles before interacting with application classes, such as when parsing HTTP query parameters.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

and Securing a NiFi Cluster with the TLS Toolkit\" guide to reflect the current situation.\r\nThe main reasons that indicated the change:\r\n- homebrew moved to /opt/homebrew from /usr/local/Cellar which changed the config location of dnsmasq.\r\n- nifi.sensitive.props.key wasn't part of the guide\r\n- it is better to use a separate location to store configs instead of littering the toolkit directory\r\n- asciidoc supports formatting xml which is better than an image when we need to copy paste the config\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11743](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11743)\r\n\r\nThe current definition of FlowRegistryClient allows implementations to return with a null value in cases such as list of buckets, flows or versions. In practice, this will not happen, but future implementations of changes has this option now.\r\n\r\nThis is something we want to eliminate both because it is considered as a bad pattern and because NiFi expect a valid (but maybe empty) return value. From code perspective this will not cause any change, but the document will be extended accordingly and will communicate that null is not a valid return value.\r\n\r\nEven if this is not a code change and the current registry client behaves in this manner, it is considered as a breaking change thus this will be part of the 2.x line only.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11744](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11744) Adds `reference-remote-resources` as new value for the `RequiredPermission` enumeration and applies the restriction to components that support retrieving configuration information from a remote URL.\r\n\r\nRemote resource retrieval is a useful configuration option for shared resources, but configuring an HTTP URL instructs the framework to make an HTTP request to a remote location. This should be a restricted operation so that fine-grained access controls can be applied when necessary, along the lines of other similar required permissions for performing privileged actions.\r\n\r\nChanges include applying the new permission to the following components:\r\n\r\n- CaptureChangeMySQL\r\n- ConsumeJMS\r\n- DBCPConnectionPool\r\n- ExtractGrok\r\n- GrokReader\r\n- HikariCPConnectionPool\r\n- HadoopDBCPConnectionPool\r\n- HBase_2_ClientService\r\n- JMSConnectionFactoryProvider\r\n- PublishJMS\r\n- ValidateJson\r\n- ValidateXml\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

I don't think it may worth extracting them in common classes because they will simply be removed from StandardSnowflakeIngestManagerProviderService in 2.0.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11739](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11739) This PR adds the \"Unmatched Column Behavior\" property to PutIceberg that is in other table-based processors such as PutDatabaseRecord. If a column exists in the target table but is not a field in the incoming records, use the data type from the target table and a value of null. If the property is set to Fail (the default and current behavior), the FlowFile will fail. If Warn, a log warning is issued. If Ignore, the aforementioned behavior is employed.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11735](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11735) Refactors integration with SAML and OIDC Identity Provider Group membership, replacing local H2 database storage with the addition of a `groups` claim to the Application Bearer Token.\r\n\r\nBoth SAML and OIDC Providers follow a similar pattern for generating an application Bearer Token based on Identity Provider information. With recent enhancements SAML and OIDC support, both strategies support retrieving Identity Provider group information. The initial SAML integration added temporary H2 database persistence for Identity Provider groups, but following refactoring for improved Spring Security integration, this temporary persistence in H2 is no longer required.\r\n\r\nInstead of storing group membership information in H2 for subsequent retrieval on every request, the refactored approach appends the group names in a multi-valued `groups` claim as part of the standard NiFi application JSON Web Token.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-7016](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-7016) This PR fixes a bug from NIFI-6145 where Groovy file functions (`withInputStream`, e.g.) were added to ExecuteGroovyScript. These didn't adhere to the Groovy spec which states the methods should return the value of the evaluated Closure versus the object it was called upon. Also removed some warnings.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11729](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11729) Upgrades the OWASP Dependency Check plugin from 8.2.1 to [8.3.1](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases) and adds several suppression notes for false positive findings.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-11727](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11727) Deprecates RethinkDB Processors for subsequent NiFi 1 releases in preparation for removal from NiFi 2 releases.\r\n\r\nThe current RethinkDB Processors depend on RethinkDB 2.3. Rethink 2.4.0 introduced notable API driver changes. These components have not been updated since initial introduction, and the implementations have memory usage issues related to buffering input and output FlowFile content. Deprecating these Processors for removal opens the potential for new versions based on the latest RethinkDB driver.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull
