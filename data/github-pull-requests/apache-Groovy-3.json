am working on research investigating test smell refactoring in which we identify alternative implementations of test cases, study how commonly used these refactorings are, and assess how acceptable

For example, in [GStringTest.java](https://github.com/apache/groovy/commit/f0bfe65ed5ae2b223b189ee600afc948af125fe4#diff-a8a3008dfada3fafce795f2a075bdbec7b14e24856857129ae21d24869ed083b), I refactored `assertFalse(\"a != c\", a.equals(c));` with `assertNotEquals(\"a != c\", a, c);`.\r\n\r\nI would like to get your feedback on this particular test smell and its refactoring.

like to be able to refer to elements of the meta-method index's `FastArray` uniformly.  What I want to do is check access modifiers.  However `CachedConstructor` and `MetaMethod` only share the non-abstract class `ParameterTypes`.  That does not seem the appropriate place to add member name, modifiers and anything else that is common to a class member.\r\n\r\nI looked at `java.lang.reflect.Member` and it specifies `getName()`, `getModifiers()`, `isSynthetic()` and `getDeclaringClass()`.  `CachedConstructor` could implement `Member` but `MetaMethod` (the other subclass of `ParameterTypes`) cannot due to a conflict with the `getDeclaringClass()` return type.  So I'd like to introduce the interface `groovy.lang.MetaMember` that is inspired by `Member` but does not declare `getDeclaringClass()`.  With this, the name and modifiers (and common modifier conveniences) are available without a bunch of `instanceof` checks.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample from `MetaClassImpl` where `ParameterTypes` and `MetaMethod` can be used in tandem:\r\n```java\r\n    private Object chooseMethodInternal(String methodName, Object methodOrList, Class[] arguments) throws MethodSelectionException {\r\n        ...\r\n        List<MetaMember> matchingMethods = new ArrayList<>(methodCount);\r\n        Object[] methodArray = methods.getArray();\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < methodCount; i += 1) {\r\n            var method = (ParameterTypes & MetaMember) methodArray[i]; // extends PT and implements MM\r\n            if (method.isValidMethod(arguments)) {\r\n                matchingMethods.add(method);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        methodCount = matchingMethods.size();\r\n        if (methodCount == 0) {\r\n            return null;\r\n        } else if (methodCount == 1) {\r\n            return matchingMethods.get(0);\r\n        }\r\n        return doChooseMostSpecificParams(theClass.getName(), methodName, matchingMethods, arguments, false);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: the diff shows `MethodHelper` renamed to `MetaMember` but it is really delete the former and add the latter.","created_at":"2023-07-25T16:03:53Z","updated_at":"2023-07-30T20:39:10Z","closed_at":"2023-07-30T20:39:05Z","merged_at":"2023-07-30T20:39:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"4408be431dd1092d8f6759b30dc59a02ea39ec0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/82fab37bcb2db27566eae53cb5f0164657dc65ce","head":{"label":"apache:meta-member","ref":"meta-member","sha":"82fab37bcb2db27566eae53cb5f0164657dc65ce","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache

languages conventionally allow sets to use '|' as union, '&' as intersection, and '^' as symmetric difference operations on sets.  This PR adds those operations to Groovy Sets and SortedSets.\r\n\r\nThis is a draft PR as there are a few design considerations that have not been discussed:\r\n\r\n- Maybe there should be an explicit symmetricDiff() method included\r\n- The second argument for the methods possibly should be Collection or Iterable when possible instead of Set.\r\n- All of these operations are well-defined for Sets, but maybe they could all apply to generic Collections -- so not sure if making them explicit to Set/SortedSet is desired.","created_at":"2023-07-13T10:44:17Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T03:22:29Z","closed_at":"2023-07-31T03:22:28Z","merged_at":"2023-07-31T03:22:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"397aedd0e8a15b18c623ceb28e36a6c66e8e6dec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/1681a6df4983d84b2398f65e6eb5b988ea89d752","head":{"label":"merscwog:set-dgm-operations","ref":"set-dgm-operations","sha":"1681a6df4983d84b2398f65e6eb5b988ea89d752","user":{"login":"merscwog","id":760761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/760761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog","html_url":"https://github.com/merscwog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":664037369,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ5Rn-Q","name":"groovy","full_name":"merscwog/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"merscwog","id":760761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/760761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog","html_url":"https://github.com/merscwog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merscwog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/merscwog/groovy","description":"Apache

This pull request enhances that functionality by instead publishing build scans to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/). On this Gradle Enterprise instance, Apache Groovy will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:\r\n\r\nDashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time\r\nBuild failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures\r\nTest failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests\r\nVery soon, we will follow up this PR with one that connects the Apache Groovy build to a remote build cache node solely for the Apache Groovy project to further help speed up builds with build caching.\r\n\r\nIf interested in exploring a fully populated Gradle Enterprise instance, please explore the Maven builds already connected to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), the [Spring projectâ€™s instance](https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.relativeStartTime=P28D&search.timeZoneId=Europe/Zurich), or any number of other [OSS projects](https://gradle.com/enterprise-customers/oss-projects/) for which we sponsor instances of Gradle Enterprise.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any questions about the value of Gradle Enterprise or the changes in this pull request and Iâ€™d be happy to address them.","created_at":"2023-05-05T14:47:29Z","updated_at":"2023-07-22T23:08:31Z","closed_at":"2023-07-22T23:08:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0de6958ed813fb1b2d56ce023d4556ade946abe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/b44b4eab583c6790f6e633dc5e080f6d15a8765c","head":{"label":"clayburn:connect-to-ge.apache.org","ref":"connect-to-ge.apache.org","sha":"b44b4eab583c6790f6e633dc5e080f6d15a8765c","user":{"login":"clayburn","id":625514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn","html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":629703225,"node_id":"R_kgDOJYiCOQ","name":"groovy","full_name":"clayburn/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clayburn","id":625514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn","html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clayburn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clayburn/groovy","description":"Apache
