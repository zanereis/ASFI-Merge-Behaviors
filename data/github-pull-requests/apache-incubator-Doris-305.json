Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently, we always disassemble aggregation into two stage: local and global. However, in some case, one stage aggregation is enough, there are two advantage of one stage aggregation.\r\n1. avoid unnecessary exchange.\r\n2. have a chance to do colocate join on the top of aggregation.\r\n\r\nThis PR move AggregateDisassemble rule from rewrite stage to optimization stage.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #12843\r\n\r\nAdd a compile option for clang: `-fno-limit-debug-info`\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, If we use clang to build the project, we can't view the contents of some objects (e.g. `std::string` objects) in gdb. It is inconvenient for us to debug the program due to the frequency of these objects is high.\r\n\r\nMore information can be refered to [Cannot view std::string when compiled with clang](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41745527/cannot-view-stdstring-when-compiled-with-clang).\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n**source code: test.cc**\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <string>\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    std::string s = \"Hello, world!\";\r\n    std::cout << s << std::endl;\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Debugging with GDB**\r\n```gdb\r\n(gdb) l\r\n1       #include <iostream>\r\n2       #include <string>\r\n3\r\n4       int main() {\r\n5           std::string s = \"Hello, world!\";\r\n6           std::cout << s << std::endl;\r\n7           return 0;\r\n8       }\r\n(gdb) b 6\r\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x14e0e: file test.cc, line 6.\r\n(gdb) r\r\nStarting program: /ssd2/lingcong/misc/clang/test\r\n\r\nBreakpoint 1, main () at test.cc:6\r\n6           std::cout << s << std::endl;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nclang++ -g test.cc -o test\r\n```\r\n\r\n```gdb\r\n(gdb) p s\r\n$1 = <incomplete type>\r\n(gdb) p s.c_str()\r\nCouldn't find method std::string::c_str\r\n(gdb)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nclang++ -fno-limit-debug-info -g test.cc -o test\r\n```\r\n\r\n```gdb\r\n(gdb) p s\r\n$1 = {static npos = 18446744073709551615, _M_dataplus = {<std::allocator<char>> = {<__gnu_cxx::new_allocator<char>> = {<No data fields>}, <No data fields>},\r\n    _M_p = 0x7fffffffe358 \"Hello, world!\"}, _M_string_length = 13, {_M_local_buf = \"Hello, world!\\000\\000\", _M_allocated_capacity = 8583909746840200520}}\r\n(gdb) p s.c_str()\r\n$2 = 0x7fffffffe358 \"Hello, world!\"\r\n(gdb)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\nthe basic idea of star-schema support is:\r\n1. fact_table JOIN dimension_table, if dimension table are filtered, the result can be regarded as applying a filter on fact table.\r\n2. fact_table JOIN dimension_table, if the dimension table is not filtered, the number of join result tuple equals to the number of fact tuples.\r\n3. dimension table JOIN fact table, the number of join result tuple is that of fact table or 2 times of dimension table.\r\n\r\nIf star-schema support is enabled, \r\n1. nereids regard duplicate key(unique key/aggregation key) as primary key\r\n2. nereids try to regard one join key as  primary key and another join key as foreign key.\r\n3. if nereids found that no join key is primary key, nereids fall back to normal estimation.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDoris is now support 3 level schema:\r\n`Catalog -> Database -> Table`\r\n\r\nHowever, when using some MySQL-compatible tools to connect to Doris,\r\nthese tools only support two-level (Database -> Table) metadata,\r\nso the database information in the external catalog cannot be displayed.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to make compatibility improvements to this issue.\r\n\r\nIn normal use, when users need to switch to other catalogs, they can use the switch statement to switch, such as:\r\n`switch hms_catalog;`\r\n\r\nand then use the `use` statement to switch the database:\r\n`use db;`\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we can directly use the following commands to directly switch the catalog and database:\r\n`use __hms_catalog__db;`\r\n\r\nHere we use `__` as a special identifier so that the system can identify and parse out the catalog name.\r\nAt the same time, we prohibit `__` in the catalog name, so as to ensure that there are no semantic errors.\r\n\r\nThis change does not require any additional configuration, and Doris will automatically perform the correct\r\noperation based on the name.\r\n\r\nI have tested mysql command line tool and dbeaver, which works fine with this feature.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 9030 -uroot -D__hive__tpch100;\r\nmysql> show tables;\r\n+-------------------+\r\n| Tables_in_tpch100 |\r\n+-------------------+\r\n| customer          |\r\n| lineitem          |\r\n| nation            |\r\n| orders            |\r\n| part              |\r\n| partsupp          |\r\n| region            |\r\n| supplier          |\r\n+-------------------+\r\n8 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe document will be added later with full `multi-catalog` feature.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThe mem hook consumes the orphan tracker by default. If the thread does not attach other trackers, by default all consumption will be passed to the process tracker through the orphan tracker.\r\n\r\nIn real time, consumption of all other trackers + orphan tracker consumption = process tracker consumption.\r\n\r\nIdeally, all threads are expected to attach to the specified tracker, so that \"all memory has its own ownership\", and the consumption of the orphan mem tracker is close to 0, but greater than 0.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T17:22:27Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T01:06:27Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T07:47:10Z","merged_at":"2022-09-21T07:47:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"b41eaa5ac02e448e2b6eb6c3d720d3100ff6512b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThe mem hook record tracker cannot guarantee that the final consumption is 0, nor can it guarantee that the memory alloc and free are recorded in a one-to-one correspondence.\r\n\r\nIn the life cycle of a memtable from insert to flush, the memory free of hook is more than that of alloc, resulting in tracker consumption less than 0.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the cumulative error of the upper load channel tracker, the memtable tracker consumption is reset to zero on destructor.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T13:48:31Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T01:03:18Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T12:16:20Z","merged_at":"2022-09-21T12:16:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"c55d08fa2fd254caaea4954ccea176422af33b6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3124041959,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI0MDQxOTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/memory-consumption","name":"area/memory-consumption","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4382140329,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBfSlxs8AAAABBTInqQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/affects-1.1","name":"affects-1.1","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4528553630,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBfSlxs8AAAABDew-ng","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/dev/merged-1.1.3-deprecated","name":"dev/merged-1.1.3-deprecated","color":"0E77AC","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/12791/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/12791/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/12791/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/cdfd84ca93ee5c98f899094787905cd9366e990b","head":{"label":"xinyiZzz:20220920_fix_load_flush","ref":"20220920_fix_load_flush","sha":"cdfd84ca93ee5c98f899094787905cd9366e990b","user":{"login":"xinyiZzz","id":13197424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTk3NDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13197424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyiZzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":302905944,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDI5MDU5NDQ=","name":"incubator-doris","full_name":"xinyiZzz/incubator-doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinyiZzz","id":13197424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTk3NDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13197424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyiZzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinyiZzz/incubator-doris","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\nThis is the second step for #12303.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\nThe previous PR #12464 added the framework to select the rollup index for OLAP table, but pre-aggregation is turned on by default.\r\nThis PR set pre-aggregation for scan OLAP table.\r\n\r\nThe main steps are as below:\r\n1. Select rollup index when aggregate is present, this is handled by `SelectRollupWithAggregate` rule.  Expressions in aggregate functions, grouping expressions, and pushdown predicates would be used to check whether the pre-aggregation should be turned off.\r\n2. When selecting from olap scan table without aggregate plan, it would be handled by `SelectRollupWithoutAggregate`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T11:02:47Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T11:12:16Z","closed_at":"2022-09-27T11:12:16Z","merged_at":"2022-09-27T11:12:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"57570f2090af5578910bf7a620635fd4400878cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1705187220,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg3MjIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/planner","name":"area/planner","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen the thread mem tracker try consume fails, an error msg will be generated, and the error msg will be returned after forcibly consume.\r\n\r\nTemporary memory requests during the generation of error msg will be tracked by errors, causing the final value of the process mem tracker to become larger.\r\n\r\nfix:\r\n1. Avoid temporary memory tracking during Hook;\r\n2. Reduce temporary memory alloc;\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T09:14:01Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T00:55:43Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T01:20:42Z","merged_at":"2022-09-21T01:20:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd4bfa8f00e30cfc59dbde8a99eaea6f4e606fa7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis pull request includes some implementations of the statistics(#6370), it Implements sql-task to collect statistics based on internal-query(#9983). \r\n\r\nAfter the `ANALYZE` statement is parsed,  statistical tasks will be generated. The statistical tasks includes mata-task(get statistics from metadata) and sql-task(get statistics by sql query). For sql-task, it will get statistics such as the row_count, the number of null values, and the maximum value by SQL query.\r\n\r\nFor statistical tasks, also include sampling sql-task, which will be implemented in the next pr.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWe used output list to compare two LogicalProperties before. Since join reorder will change the children order of a join plan and caused output list changed. the two join plan will not equals anymore in memo although they should be. So we must add a project on the new join to keep the LogicalProperties the same.\r\nThis PR changes the equals and hashCode funtions of LogicalProperties. use a set of output to compare two LogicalProperties. Then we do not need add the top peoject anymore. This help us keep memo simple and efficient. \r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.
