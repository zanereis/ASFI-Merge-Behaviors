Spark 1.6 works because it internally uses insertInto. But, if we change it back it will break the semantic of saveAsTable (this method uses by-name resolution instead of using by-position resolution used by insertInto). More extra changes are needed to support `hive` as a `format` in DataFrameWriter.\r\n\r\nInstead, users should use insertInto API. This PR corrects the error messages. Users can understand how to bypass it before we support it in a separate PR.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest cases are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRevise HDFSMetadataLog API such that metadata object serialization and final batch file write are separated.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is an outstanding issue that existed for a long time: Sometimes the shuffle blocks are corrupt and can't be decompressed. We recently hit this in three different workloads, sometimes we can reproduce it by every try, sometimes can't. I also found that when the corruption happened, the beginning and end of the blocks are correct, the corruption happen in the middle. There was one case that the string of block id is corrupt by one character. It seems that it's very likely the corruption is introduced by some weird machine/hardware, also the checksum (16 bits) in TCP is not strong enough to identify all the corruption.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Spark does not have checksum for shuffle blocks or broadcast, the job will fail if any corruption happen in the shuffle block from disk, or broadcast blocks during network. This PR try to detect the corruption after fetching shuffle blocks by decompressing them, because most of the compression already have checksum in them. It will retry the block, or failed with FetchFailure, so the previous stage could be retried on different (still random) machines.\r\n\r\nChecksum for broadcast will be added by another PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-18T00:45:40Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T03:57:10Z","closed_at":"2016-12-09T23:47:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e14d2bf3b316b2a778210925d460ad0beb755b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b43d38455b7fb8f27f1459db81fdac00bef52693","head":{"label":"davies:detect_corrupt","ref":"detect_corrupt","sha":"b43d38455b7fb8f27f1459db81fdac00bef52693","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a `ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Long` error which could occur in the HistoryServer while trying to process a deserialized `SparkListenerDriverAccumUpdates` event.\r\n\r\nThe problem stems from how `jackson-module-scala` handles primitive type parameters (see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala/wiki/FAQ#deserializing-optionint-and-other-primitive-challenges for more details). This was causing a problem where our code expected a field to be deserialized as a `(Long, Long)` tuple but we got an `(Int, Int)` tuple instead.\r\n\r\nThis patch hacks around this issue by registering a custom `Converter` with Jackson in order to deserialize the tuples as `(Object, Object)` and perform the appropriate casting.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew regression tests in `SQLListenerSuite`.","created_at":"2016-11-18T00:10:15Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T02:52:46Z","closed_at":"2016-11-18T02:47:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b6f266d19a36bd1d355f3934921eac43edb47a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9f674be5efd72cf58e2139343202904f26e14966","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-18462","ref":"SPARK-18462","sha":"9f674be5efd72cf58e2139343202904f26e14966","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the configuration `numPartitions` to the StructuredStreaming Kafka Source. Setting this value to a value higher than the number of `TopicPartitions` that you're going to consume will allow Spark to have multiple tasks reading from the same `TopicPartition` allowing users to handle skewed partitions.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of `TopicPartitions` could be dynamic from batch to batch, e.g. you may delete/create topics, in ETL use cases where you generally have a set of static number of TopicPartitions, this configuration has been very useful.\r\n\r\nIf the `TopicPartitions` are dynamic, then we will always have a parallelism of `max(topicPartitions.length, numPartitions)`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests. I used this on production data and it certainly helped in handling peak loads and skewed partitions.","created_at":"2016-11-16T22:48:27Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:57:09Z","closed_at":"2017-01-10T19:57:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d14f962cba6959a31997bb386972d7250955ea4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15909/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15909/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15909/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e8ec175a8e656ba5f23e30ef334204f6a734301f","head":{"label":"brkyvz:split-kafka-partitions","ref":"split-kafka-partitions","sha":"e8ec175a8e656ba5f23e30ef334204f6a734301f","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSuggest users to increase `NodeManager's` heap size if `External Shuffle Service` is enabled as\r\n`NM` can spend a lot of time doing GC resulting in  shuffle operations being a bottleneck due to `Shuffle Read blocked time` bumped up. \r\nAlso because of GC  `NodeManager` can use an enormous amount of CPU and cluster performance will suffer.\r\nI have seen NodeManager using 5-13G RAM and up to 2700% CPU with `spark_shuffle` service on.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Added step

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to backport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15878\r\n\r\nWhen the exception is an invocation exception during function lookup, we return a useless/confusing error message:\r\n\r\nFor example, \r\n```Scala\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"concat_ws()\")\r\n```\r\nBelow is the error message we got:\r\n```\r\nnull; line 1 pos 0\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: null; line 1 pos 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the meaningful error message, we need to get the cause. The fix is exactly the same as what we did in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12136. After the fix, the message we got is the exception issued in the constuctor of function implementation:\r\n```\r\nrequirement failed: concat_ws requires at least one argument.; line 1 pos 0\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: requirement failed: concat_ws requires at least one argument.; line 1 pos 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr extracts method for preparing arguments from `StaticInvoke`, `Invoke` and `NewInstance` and modify to short circuit if arguments have `null` when `propageteNull == true`.\r\n\r\nThe steps are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Introduce `InvokeLike` to extract common logic from `StaticInvoke`, `Invoke` and `NewInstance` to prepare arguments.\r\n`StaticInvoke` and `Invoke` had a risk to exceed 64kb JVM limit to prepare arguments but after this patch they can handle them because they share the preparing code of NewInstance, which handles the limit well.\r\n\r\n2. Remove unneeded null checking and fix nullability of `NewInstance`.\r\nAvoid some of nullabilty checking which are not needed because the expression is not nullable.\r\n\r\n3. Modify to short circuit if arguments have `null` when `needNullCheck == true`.\r\nIf `needNullCheck == true`, preparing arguments can be skipped if we found one of them is `null`, so modified to short circuit in the case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-16T06:30:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T04:08:16Z","closed_at":"2016-11-21T04:08:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"458cebf07888e1e0b68d2deff88fabfb72039328","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c88a1ff1b6eeed41dd15e0215070341ca9b7c821","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-18467","ref":"issues/SPARK-18467","sha":"c88a1ff1b6eeed41dd15e0215070341ca9b7c821","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore Spark 2.1, users can create an external data source table without schema, and we will infer the table schema at runtime. In Spark 2.1, we decided to infer the schema when the table was created, so that we don't need to infer it again and again at runtime.\r\n\r\nThis is a good improvement, but we should still respect and support old tables which doesn't store table schema in metastore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nregression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA `withFilter` method has been added to `RDD` as an alias for the `filter` method. When using `for` comprehensions, the Scala compiler prefers (and as of 2.12, _requires_) the lazy `withFilter` method, only falling back to using the `filter` method (which, for regular collections, is non-lazy, but for RDDs is lazy). Prior to Scala 2.12, this fallback causes the compiler to emit a warning, and as of Scala 2.12, it results in an error.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`RDDSuite` was updated by adding a line to \"basic operations\" that duplicates the behavior of the `filter` test, but uses a `for` comprehension instead of a direct method call.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-16T06:00:44Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:53Z","closed_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5161ce323362433b52d35fa6ae92966c80653b29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15899/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15899/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15899/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db9cf5a9627755e1c8e212b7f29d54dc8bed1c54","head":{"label":"reggert:feature/withfilter","ref":"feature/withfilter","sha":"db9cf5a9627755e1c8e212b7f29d54dc8bed1c54","user":{"login":"reggert","id":1971881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzE4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1971881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert","html_url":"https://github.com/reggert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44838167,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDgzODE2Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"reggert/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reggert","id":1971881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzE4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1971881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert","html_url":"https://github.com/reggert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reggert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reggert/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen reading zero columns (e.g., count(*)) from ORC or any other format that uses HiveShim, actually set the read column list to empty for Hive to use.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nQuery correctness is handled by existing unit tests. I'm happy to add more if anyone can point out some case that is not covered.\r\n\r\nReduction in data read can be verified in the UI when built with a recent version of Hadoop say:\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.7 -Dhadoop.version=2.7.0 -Phive -DskipTests clean package\r\n```\r\nHowever the default Hadoop 2.2 that is used for unit tests does not report actual bytes read and instead just full file sizes (see FileScanRDD.scala line 80). Therefore I don't think there is a good way to add a unit test for this.\r\n\r\nI tested with the following setup using above build options\r\n```\r\ncase class OrcData(intField: Long, stringField: String)\r\nspark.range(1,1000000).map(i => OrcData(i, s\"part-$i\")).toDF().write.format(\"orc\").save(\"orc_test\")\r\n\r\nsql(\r\n      s\"\"\"CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE orc_test(\r\n         |  intField LONG,\r\n         |  stringField STRING\r\n         |)\r\n         |STORED AS ORC\r\n         |LOCATION '${System.getProperty(\"user.dir\") + \"/orc_test\"}'\r\n       \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nquery | Spark 2.0.2 | this PR\r\n---|---|---\r\n`sql(\"select count(*) from orc_test\").collect`|4.4 MB|199.4 KB\r\n`sql(\"select intField from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile this behavior is debatable, consider the following use case:\r\n```sql\r\nUNCACHE TABLE foo;\r\nCACHE TABLE foo AS \r\nSELECT * FROM bar\r\n```\r\nThe command above fails the first time you run it. But I want to run the command above over and over again, and I don't want to change my code just for the first run of it.\r\nThe issue is that subsequent `CACHE TABLE` commands do not overwrite the existing table.\r\n\r\nNow we can do:\r\n```sql\r\nUNCACHE TABLE IF EXISTS foo;\r\nCACHE TABLE foo AS \r\nSELECT * FROM bar\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-18459: triggerId seems like a number that should be increasing with each trigger, whether or not there is data in it. However, actually, triggerId increases only where there is a batch of data in a trigger. So its better to rename it to batchId.\r\n\r\nSPARK-18460: triggerDetails was missing from json representation. Fixed it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated existing unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-16T00:58:02Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T18:03:05Z","closed_at":"2016-11-16T18:03:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f95886318b4cf1ad7cf0e681949dbf2f0eb3898","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15895/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15895/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15895/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3d892c150624f62ff4f4eaa6f881614c883d7e1","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-18459","ref":"SPARK-18459","sha":"d3d892c150624f62ff4f4eaa6f881614c883d7e1","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to some of the discussion [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15593). During LogisticRegression training, we store the coefficients combined with intercepts as a flat vector, but a more natural abstraction is a matrix. Here, we refactor the code to use matrix where possible, which makes the code more readable and greatly simplifies the indexing.\r\n\r\nNote: We do not use a Breeze matrix for the cost function as was mentioned in the linked PR. This is because LBFGS/OWLQN require an implicit `MutableInnerProductModule[DenseMatrix[Double], Double]` which is not natively defined in Breeze. We would need to extend Breeze in Spark to define it ourselves. Also, we do not modify the `regParamL1Fun` because OWLQN in Breeze requires a `MutableEnumeratedCoordinateField[(Int, Int), DenseVector[Double]]` (since we still use a dense vector for coefficients). Here again we would have to extend Breeze inside Spark.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is internal code refactoring - the current unit tests passing show us that the change did not break anything. No added functionality in this patch.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-15T23:11:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T03:31:16Z","closed_at":"2016-11-20T20:48:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55e3b1fd4ac391e3f134049a56647c949366afa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/28f67fb27d3a760597fd7281900c756b4dd79c17","head":{"label":"sethah:logreg_refactor","ref":"logreg_refactor","sha":"28f67fb27d3a760597fd7281900c756b4dd79c17","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `FoldablePropagation` optimizer rule, pulls foldable values out from under an `Expand`. This breaks the `Expand` in two ways:\r\n\r\n- It rewrites the output attributes of the `Expand`. We explicitly define output attributes for `Expand`, these are (unfortunately) considered as part of the expressions of the `Expand` and can be rewritten.\r\n- Expand can actually change the column (it will typically re-use the attributes or the underlying plan). This means that we cannot safely propagate the expressions from under an `Expand`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this and (hopefully) other issues by explicitly whitelisting allowed operators.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15857\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `FoldablePropagationSuite` and to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen running SparkR job in yarn-cluster mode, it will download Spark package from apache website which is not necessary.\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit --master yarn-cluster ./examples/src/main/r/dataframe.R\r\n```\r\nThe following is output:\r\n```\r\nAttaching package: ‘SparkR’\r\n\r\nThe following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’:\r\n\r\n    cov, filter, lag, na.omit, predict, sd, var, window\r\n\r\nThe following objects are masked from ‘package:base’:\r\n\r\n    as.data.frame, colnames, colnames<-, drop, endsWith, intersect,\r\n    rank, rbind, sample, startsWith, subset, summary, transform, union\r\n\r\nSpark not found in SPARK_HOME:\r\nSpark not found in the cache directory. Installation will start.\r\nMirrorUrl not provided.\r\nLooking for preferred site from apache website...\r\n......\r\n```\r\nThere's no ```SPARK_HOME``` in yarn-cluster mode since the R process is in a remote host of the yarn cluster rather than in the client host.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-18012 refactored the file write path in FileStreamSink using FileFormatWriter which always uses the default non-streaming QueryExecution to perform the writes. This is wrong for FileStreamSink, because the streaming QueryExecution (i.e. IncrementalExecution) should be used for correctly incrementalizing aggregation. The addition of watermarks in SPARK-18124, file stream sink should logically supports aggregation + watermark + append mode. But actually it fails with\r\n```\r\n16:23:07.389 ERROR org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StreamExecution: Query query-0 terminated with error\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: No

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve DataSource option keys to be more case-insensitive\r\n\r\nDataSource partially use CaseInsensitiveMap in code-path. For example, the following fails to find url.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(sparkContext.parallelize(arr2x2), schema2)\r\ndf.write.format(\"jdbc\")\r\n    .option(\"UrL\", url1)\r\n    .option(\"dbtable\", \"TEST.SAVETEST\")\r\n    .options(properties.asScala)\r\n    .save()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR makes DataSource options to use CaseInsensitiveMap internally and also makes DataSource to use CaseInsensitiveMap generally except `InMemoryFileIndex` and `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`. We can not pass them CaseInsensitiveMap because they creates new case-sensitive HadoopConfs by calling newHadoopConfWithOptions(options) inside.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins test with newly added test cases.","created_at":"2016-11-15T00:25:18Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T19:35:23Z","closed_at":"2016-11-16T09:14:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"919ab18c1170bcce38e01d57617af35b773a894d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15884/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15884/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15884/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6570665c8a2458e31ecb3f1262e64970eb686387","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-18433","ref":"SPARK-18433","sha":"6570665c8a2458e31ecb3f1262e64970eb686387","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4ac9759f807d217b6f67badc6d5f6b7138eb92d2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark SQL follows MySQL to do the implicit type conversion for binary comparison: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/type-conversion.html\r\n\r\nHowever, this may return confusing result, e.g. `1 = 'true'` will return true, `19157170390056973L = '19157170390056971'` will return true.\r\n\r\nI think it's more reasonable to follow postgres in this case, i.e. cast string to the type of the other side, but return null if the string is not castable to keep hive compatibility.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnewly added tests.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-14T10:55:04Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T18:22:34Z","closed_at":"2017-01-24T18:21:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9fc901673f79452e240a82e7b58fb313f0504380","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a11f89bf5ed13b4061a29daf007a608314465a94","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:compare","ref":"compare","sha":"a11f89bf5ed13b4061a29daf007a608314465a94","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen the exception is an invocation exception during function lookup, we return a useless/confusing error message:\r\n\r\nFor example, \r\n```Scala\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"concat_ws()\")\r\n```\r\nBelow is the error message we got:\r\n```\r\nnull; line 1 pos 0\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: null; line 1 pos 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the meaningful error message, we need to get the cause. The fix is exactly the same as what we did in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12136. After the fix, the message we got is the exception issued in the constuctor of function implementation:\r\n```\r\nrequirement failed: concat_ws requires at least one argument.; line 1 pos 0\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: requirement failed: concat_ws requires at least one argument.; line 1 pos 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(1) Change output schema to `Array of Vector` instead of `Vectors`\r\n(2) Use `numHashTables` as the dimension of Array\r\n(3) Rename `RandomProjection` to `BucketedRandomProjectionLSH`, `MinHash` to `MinHashLSH`\r\n(4) Make `randUnitVectors/randCoefficients` private\r\n(5) Make Multi-Probe NN Search and `hashDistance` private for future discussion\r\n\r\nSaved for future PRs:\r\n(1) AND-amplification and `numHashFunctions` as the dimension of Vector are saved for a future PR.\r\n(2) `hashDistance` and MultiProbe NN Search needs more discussion. The current implementation is just a backward compatible one.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRelated unit tests are modified to make sure the performance of LSH are ensured, and the outputs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new JDBCOption `maxConnections` which means the maximum number of simultaneous JDBC connections allowed. This option applies only to writing with coalesce operation if needed. It defaults to the number of partitions of RDD. Previously, SQL users cannot cannot control this while Scala/Java/Python users can use `coalesce` (or `repartition`) API. \r\n\r\n**Reported Scenario**\r\n\r\nFor the following cases, the number of connections becomes 200 and database cannot handle all of them.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW resultview\r\nUSING org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc\r\nOPTIONS (\r\n  url \"jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.129.10.111:1521:BKDB\",\r\n  dbtable \"result\",\r\n  user \"HIVE\",\r\n  password \"HIVE\"\r\n);\r\n-- set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=200\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE resultview SELECT g, count(1) AS COUNT FROM tnet.DT_LIVE_INFO GROUP BY g\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual. Do the followings and see Spark UI.\r\n\r\n**Step 1 (MySQL)**\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t1 (a INT);\r\nCREATE TABLE data (a INT);\r\nINSERT INTO data VALUES (1);\r\nINSERT INTO data VALUES (2);\r\nINSERT INTO data VALUES (3);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 2 (Spark)**\r\n```scala\r\nSPARK_HOME=$PWD bin/spark-shell --driver-memory 4G --driver-class-path mysql-connector-java-5.1.40-bin.jar\r\nscala> sql(\"SET

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `JDBCRelation.insert` removes Spark options too early by mistakenly using `asConnectionProperties`. Spark options like `numPartitions` should be passed into `DataFrameWriter.jdbc` correctly. This bug have been **hidden** because `JDBCOptions.asConnectionProperties` fails to filter out the mixed-case options. This PR aims to fix both.\r\n\r\n**JDBCRelation.insert**\r\n```scala\r\noverride def insert(data: DataFrame, overwrite: Boolean): Unit = {\r\n  val url = jdbcOptions.url\r\n  val table = jdbcOptions.table\r\n- val properties = jdbcOptions.asConnectionProperties\r\n+ val properties = jdbcOptions.asProperties\r\n  data.write\r\n    .mode(if (overwrite) SaveMode.Overwrite else SaveMode.Append)\r\n    .jdbc(url, table, properties)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**JDBCOptions.asConnectionProperties**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JDBCOptions\r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.CaseInsensitiveMap\r\nscala> new JDBCOptions(Map(\"url\" -> \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/temp\", \"dbtable\" -> \"t1\", \"numPartitions\" -> \"10\")).asConnectionProperties\r\nres0: java.util.Properties = {numpartitions=10}\r\nscala> new JDBCOptions(new CaseInsensitiveMap(Map(\"url\" -> \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/temp\", \"dbtable\" -> \"t1\", \"numPartitions\" -> \"10\"))).asConnectionProperties\r\nres1: java.util.Properties = {numpartitions=10}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with a new

Implement a new commit protocol named `HadoopMapRedCommitProtocol` which support the old `mapred` package's committer;\r\n2. Refactor `SparkHadoopWriter` and `SparkHadoopMapReduceWriter`, now they are combined together, thus we can support write through both `mapred` and `mapreduce` API by the new `SparkHadoopWriter`, a lot of duplicated codes are removed;\r\n3. Moved `SparkHadoopWriterUtils` to a seprated file.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis PR is not changing any behavior, so it is tested by the existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `FoldablePropagation` optimizer rule, pulls foldable values out from under an `Expand`. This breaks the `Expand` in two ways:\r\n\r\n- It rewrites the output attributes of the `Expand`. We explicitly define output attributes for `Expand`, these are (unfortunately) considered as part of the expressions of the `Expand` and can be rewritten.\r\n- Expand can actually change the column (it will typically re-use the attributes or the underlying plan). This means that we cannot safely propagate the expressions from under an `Expand`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this and (hopefully) other issues by explicitly whitelisting allowed operators.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `FoldablePropagationSuite` and to `SQLQueryTestSuite`.","created_at":"2016-11-11T23:48:13Z","updated_at":"2016-11-15T20:06:10Z","closed_at":"2016-11-15T15:01:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97241d14089164bff278f7b21cf42d80f12d5af8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15857/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15857/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15857/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/265051fa8ff1b592a7204b01729ec659cb8c7252","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-18300","ref":"SPARK-18300","sha":"265051fa8ff1b592a7204b01729ec659cb8c7252","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `SQLBuilder` handles `LIMIT` by always adding `LIMIT` at the end of the generated subSQL. It makes `RuntimeException`s like the following. This PR adds a parenthesis always except `SubqueryAlias` is used together with `LIMIT`.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl(id INT)\")\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE VIEW v1(id2) AS SELECT id FROM tbl LIMIT 2\")\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to analyze the canonicalized SQL: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl(id INT)\")\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE VIEW v1(id2) AS SELECT id FROM tbl LIMIT 2\")\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT id2 FROM v1\")\r\nres4: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [id2: int]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fixed cases in this PR**\r\n\r\nThe following two cases are the detail query plans having problematic SQL generations.\r\n\r\n1. `SELECT * FROM (SELECT id FROM tbl LIMIT 2)`\r\n\r\n    Please note that **FROM SELECT** part of the generated SQL in the below. When we don't use '()' for limit, this fails.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n# Original logical plan:\r\nProject [id#1]\r\n+- GlobalLimit 2\r\n   +- LocalLimit 2\r\n      +- Project [id#1]\r\n         +- MetastoreRelation default, tbl\r\n\r\n# Canonicalized logical plan:\r\nProject [gen_attr_0#1 AS id#4]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias tbl\r\n   +- Project [gen_attr_0#1]\r\n      +- GlobalLimit 2\r\n         +- LocalLimit 2\r\n            +- Project [gen_attr_0#1]\r\n               +- SubqueryAlias gen_subquery_0\r\n                  +- Project [id#1 AS gen_attr_0#1]\r\n                     +- SQLTable default, tbl, [id#1]\r\n\r\n# Generated SQL:\r\nSELECT `gen_attr_0` AS `id` FROM (SELECT `gen_attr_0` FROM SELECT `gen_attr_0` FROM (SELECT `id` AS `gen_attr_0` FROM `default`.`tbl`) AS gen_subquery_0 LIMIT 2) AS tbl\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `SELECT * FROM (SELECT id FROM tbl TABLESAMPLE (2 ROWS))`\r\n\r\n    Please note that **((~~~) AS gen_subquery_0 LIMIT 2)** in the below. When we use '()' for limit on `SubqueryAlias`, this fails.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n# Original logical plan:\r\nProject [id#1]\r\n+- Project [id#1]\r\n   +- GlobalLimit 2\r\n      +- LocalLimit 2\r\n         +- MetastoreRelation default, tbl\r\n\r\n# Canonicalized logical plan:\r\nProject [gen_attr_0#1 AS id#4]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias tbl\r\n   +- Project [gen_attr_0#1]\r\n      +- GlobalLimit 2\r\n         +- LocalLimit 2\r\n            +- SubqueryAlias gen_subquery_0\r\n               +- Project [id#1 AS gen_attr_0#1]\r\n                  +- SQLTable default, tbl, [id#1]\r\n\r\n# Generated SQL:\r\nSELECT `gen_attr_0` AS `id` FROM (SELECT `gen_attr_0` FROM ((SELECT `id` AS `gen_attr_0` FROM `default`.`tbl`) AS gen_subquery_0 LIMIT 2)) AS tbl\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins test with a newly added test case.","created_at":"2016-11-11T23:12:37Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T19:35:44Z","closed_at":"2016-11-12T02:31:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54cee7596084b487435ec425ef5e1beda00982b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92d901b13be0a60cfda7cd8fba4ec8bb3c0610f6","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-17982-2","ref":"SPARK-17982-2","sha":"92d901b13be0a60cfda7cd8fba4ec8bb3c0610f6","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-2.0","ref":"branch-2.0","sha":"99575e88fd711c3fc25e8e6f00bbc8d1491feed6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, when CTE is used in RunnableCommand, the Analyzer does not replace the logical node `With`. The child plan of RunnableCommand is not resolved. Thus, the output of the `With` plan node looks very confusing.\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\nsql(\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n    |CREATE VIEW cte_view AS\r\n    |WITH w AS (SELECT 1 AS n), cte1 (select 2), cte2 as (select 3)\r\n    |SELECT n FROM w\r\n  \"\"\".stripMargin).explain()\r\n```\r\nThe output is like\r\n```\r\nExecutedCommand\r\n   +- CreateViewCommand `cte_view`, WITH w AS (SELECT 1 AS n), cte1 (select 2), cte2 as (select 3)\r\nSELECT n FROM w, false, false, PersistedView\r\n         +- 'With [(w,SubqueryAlias w\r\n+- Project [1 AS n#16]\r\n   +- OneRowRelation$\r\n), (cte1,'SubqueryAlias cte1\r\n+- 'Project [unresolvedalias(2, None)]\r\n   +- OneRowRelation$\r\n), (cte2,'SubqueryAlias cte2\r\n+- 'Project [unresolvedalias(3, None)]\r\n   +- OneRowRelation$\r\n)]\r\n            +- 'Project ['n]\r\n               +- 'UnresolvedRelation `w`\r\n```\r\nAfter the fix, the output is as shown below.\r\n```\r\nExecutedCommand\r\n   +- CreateViewCommand `cte_view`, WITH w AS (SELECT 1 AS n), cte1 (select 2), cte2 as (select 3)\r\nSELECT n FROM w, false, false, PersistedView\r\n         +- CTE [w, cte1, cte2]\r\n            :  :- SubqueryAlias w\r\n            :  :  +- Project [1 AS n#16]\r\n            :  :     +- OneRowRelation$\r\n            :  :- 'SubqueryAlias cte1\r\n            :  :  +- 'Project [unresolvedalias(2, None)]\r\n            :  :     +- OneRowRelation$\r\n            :  +- 'SubqueryAlias cte2\r\n            :     +- 'Project [unresolvedalias(3, None)]\r\n            :        +- OneRowRelation$\r\n            +- 'Project ['n]\r\n               +- 'UnresolvedRelation `w`\r\n```\r\n\r\nBTW, this PR also fixes the output of the view type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCompactibleFileStreamLog relys on \"compactInterval\" to detect a compaction batch. If the \"compactInterval\" is reset by user, CompactibleFileStreamLog will return wrong answer, resulting data loss. This PR procides a way to check the validity of 'compactInterval', and calculate an appropriate value.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nWhen restart a stream, we change the 'spark.sql.streaming.fileSource.log.compactInterval' different with the former one.\r\n\r\nThe primary solution to this issue was given by @uncleGen \r\nAdded extensions include an additional metadata field in OffsetSeq and CompactibleFileStreamLog APIs. @zsxwing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn`JavaWrapper `'s destructor make Java Gateway dereference object in destructor, using `SparkContext._active_spark_context._gateway.detach` \r\nFixing the copying parameter bug, by moving the `copy` method from `JavaModel` to `JavaParams`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n```scala\r\nimport random, string\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer\r\n\r\nl = [(''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase) for _ in range(10)), ) for _ in range(int(7e5))]  # 700000 random strings of 10 characters\r\ndf =

strong reference, causing GC issues and is halted midway\r\nAfter: garbage collection works as the object is dereferenced, and computation completes\r\n* Mem footprint tested using profiler\r\n* Added a parameter copy related test which was failing before.","created_at":"2016-11-10T16:24:15Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T21:25:10Z","closed_at":"2016-12-01T21:25:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fea2d3d7f6bc950d22d4d1f3b7c0e8813397a5ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15843/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15843/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15843/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/37e83e88fe84dcfdcd04426c85499f7494cd688b","head":{"label":"techaddict:SPARK-18274","ref":"SPARK-18274","sha":"37e83e88fe84dcfdcd04426c85499f7494cd688b","user":{"login":"techaddict","id":1378755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzg3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1378755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict","html_url":"https://github.com/techaddict","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18507796,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODUwNzc5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"techaddict/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"techaddict","id":1378755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzg3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1378755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict","html_url":"https://github.com/techaddict","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techaddict/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/techaddict/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we search data in History Server, it will check if any columns contains the search string. Duration is represented as long value in table, so if we search simple string like \"003\", \"111\", the duration containing \"003\", ‘111“ will be showed, which make not much sense to users.\r\nWe cannot simply transfer the long value to meaning format like \"1 h\", \"3.2 min\" because they are also used for sorting.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs per the discussion at #15807, we need to change the way of subexpression elimination.\r\n\r\nIn current approach, common subexpressions are evaluated no matter they are really used or not later. E.g., in the following generated codes, `subexpr2` is evaluated even only the `if` branch is run.\r\n\r\n    if (isNull(subexpr)) {\r\n      ...\r\n    } else {\r\n      AssertNotNull(subexpr)  // subexpr2\r\n      ....\r\n      SomeExpr(AssertNotNull(subexpr)) // SomeExpr(subexpr2)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBesides possible performance regression, the expression like `AssertNotNull` can throw exception. So wrongly evaluating `subexpr2` will throw exception unexceptedly..\r\n\r\nWith this patch, now common subexpressions are not evaluated until they are used. We create a function for each common subexpression which evaluates and stores the result as a member variable. We have an initialization status variable to record whether the subexpression is evaluated.\r\n\r\nThus, when an expression using the subexpression is going to be evaluated, we check if the subexpression is initialized, if yes directly returning the result, if no call the function to evaluate it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to changes in #14649 to meet the new codebase changes. It is slightly different in that it will not filter files explicitly, but it allows a FileFormat to prune splits (if applicable). This is implemented in ParquetFileFormat and every other format maintains the same behavior.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPassing current tests and added two new tests to validate the pruning and ensure that excessive filtering does not occur on malformed metadata.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nCloses #14649

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nRight now `CompactibleFileStreamLog` uses `compactInterval` to check if a batch is a compaction batch. However, since this conf is controlled by the user, they may just change it, and `CompactibleFileStreamLog` will just silently return the wrong answer.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nWith this patch the `compactInterval` configuration should only be used when deciding if we should perform a new compaction. The identification of a compaction vs a delta is done by looking for the compact suffix.\r\n\r\nIn more details, upon each start/restart, we first examine what metadata files were there, what files among them are compacted files. We introduce `knownCompactionBatches` to hold the existing compaction batches before this run, and `zeroBatch` to hold the first batch this run should write to.\r\n\r\nThus we can support the following situations:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  (1) a fresh run\r\n  (2) the previous run with `compactInterval` = 2\r\n      0\r\n  (3) the previous run with `compactInterval` = 2\r\n      0   1.compact\r\n  (4) previous runs with `compactInterval` = 2 and `compactInterval` = 5\r\n      0   1.compact    2   3.compact   4.compact\r\n  (5) previous runs with `compactInterval` = 2 and `compactInterval` = 5\r\n      0   1.compact    2   3.compact   4.compact   5   6   7   8\r\n```\r\n with:\r\n```\r\n  (1) `knownCompactionBatches` = (), `zeroBatch` = 0\r\n  (2) `knownCompactionBatches` = (), `zeroBatch` = 1\r\n  (3) `knownCompactionBatches` = (1), `zeroBatch` = 2\r\n  (4) `knownCompactionBatches` = (1, 3, 4), `zeroBatch` = 5\r\n  (5) `knownCompactionBatches` = (1, 3, 4), `zeroBatch` = 9\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote this appoach does not require the `compactInteral` for a new run must be consistent with previous runs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded test
