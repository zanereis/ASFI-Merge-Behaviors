[grpc-protobuf](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java) from 1.43.2 to 1.53.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">grpc-protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.53.0</h2>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>googleapis: Allow user set c2p bootstrap config (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9856\">#9856</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: Add contain and stringMatcher in <code>RouteConfiguration</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9845\">#9845</a>)</li>\n<li>core: Add <code>grpc-previous-rpc-attempts</code> to the initial response metadata (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9686\">#9686</a>)</li>\n<li>servlet: Implement gRPC server as a Servlet (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8596\">#8596</a>)</li>\n<li>authz: Implement static authorization server interceptor (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8934\">#8934</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Examples</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>servlet: Add servlet example (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8596\">#8596</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Update xds error handling logic.  Specifically:\n<ul>\n<li>When the ads stream is closed only send errors to subscribers that haven't yet gotten results</li>\n<li>Timers to detect missing resources don’t start until the adsStream is ready (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9745\">#9745</a>)</li>\n<li>Call subscriber onError callback when xds client fails to connect to server (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9827\">#9827</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>core: Delay retriable stream master listener close until all sub streams are closed. This fixes the call executor lifecycle and prevents potential <code>RejectedExecutionException</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9754\">#9754</a>)</li>\n<li>core: Free unused <code>MessageProducer</code> in <code>RetriableStream</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9853\">#9853</a>), fixing a Netty buffer memory leak for cancelled RPCs</li>\n<li>api: Fail with <code>NullPointerException</code> when a Metadata.Marshaller returns null bytes (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9781\">#9781</a>). This would previously cause a <code>NullPointerException</code> later during the RPC. Now the return value of the Marshaller is checked immediately, to help find the broken Marshaller</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Disallow duplicate addresses in the RingHashLB. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9776\">#9776</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: EDS weight sums are allowed up to max unsigned int (was max signed int) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9765\">#9765</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: Drop xds v2 support (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9760\">#9760</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>JUnit upgraded to 4.13.2</li>\n<li>bazel: Dropped support for Bazel 4. We track the two most recent major versions of Bazel, Bazel 5 and 6. Bazel 4 may still work, but we are no longer testing it</li>\n<li>bazel: Include Tomcat annotations dependency for <code>@Generated</code> as used by autovalue (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9762\">#9762</a>). Necessary for building xds and rls on Java 9+</li>\n<li>bazel: Export deps from Maven Central-specific stand-in targets (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9780\">#9780</a>). Some Maven Central artifacts are a combination of multiple Bazel targets, like grpc-core is composed of //core:inprocess, //core:internal, //core:util, //api. There is a “//core:core_maven” target used by maven_install that uses the other targets. Previously the target used <code>runtime_deps</code> to discourage their use by Bazel users, but that could cause compilation failures from lack of hjars. These targets now use <code>exports</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cpovirk\"><code>@​cpovirk</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/niloc132\"><code>@​niloc132</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stephenh\"><code>@​stephenh</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/olderwei\"><code>@​olderwei</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pandaapo\"><code>@​pandaapo</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/panxuefeng\"><code>@​panxuefeng</code></a></p>\n<h2>v1.52.1</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Fix an internal bug in xds resource subscription that might cause xds stream not accepting response update for that resource type entirely.

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">grpc-protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.53.0</h2>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>googleapis: Allow user set c2p bootstrap config (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9856\">#9856</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: Add contain and stringMatcher in <code>RouteConfiguration</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9845\">#9845</a>)</li>\n<li>core: Add <code>grpc-previous-rpc-attempts</code> to the initial response metadata (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9686\">#9686</a>)</li>\n<li>servlet: Implement gRPC server as a Servlet (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8596\">#8596</a>)</li>\n<li>authz: Implement static authorization server interceptor (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8934\">#8934</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Examples</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>servlet: Add servlet example (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8596\">#8596</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Update xds error handling logic.  Specifically:\n<ul>\n<li>When the ads stream is closed only send errors to subscribers that haven't yet gotten results</li>\n<li>Timers to detect missing resources don’t start until the adsStream is ready (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9745\">#9745</a>)</li>\n<li>Call subscriber onError callback when xds client fails to connect to server (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9827\">#9827</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>core: Delay retriable stream master listener close until all sub streams are closed. This fixes the call executor lifecycle and prevents potential <code>RejectedExecutionException</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9754\">#9754</a>)</li>\n<li>core: Free unused <code>MessageProducer</code> in <code>RetriableStream</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9853\">#9853</a>), fixing a Netty buffer memory leak for cancelled RPCs</li>\n<li>api: Fail with <code>NullPointerException</code> when a Metadata.Marshaller returns null bytes (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9781\">#9781</a>). This would previously cause a <code>NullPointerException</code> later during the RPC. Now the return value of the Marshaller is checked immediately, to help find the broken Marshaller</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Disallow duplicate addresses in the RingHashLB. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9776\">#9776</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: EDS weight sums are allowed up to max unsigned int (was max signed int) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9765\">#9765</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: Drop xds v2 support (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9760\">#9760</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>JUnit upgraded to 4.13.2</li>\n<li>bazel: Dropped support for Bazel 4. We track the two most recent major versions of Bazel, Bazel 5 and 6. Bazel 4 may still work, but we are no longer testing it</li>\n<li>bazel: Include Tomcat annotations dependency for <code>@Generated</code> as used by autovalue (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9762\">#9762</a>). Necessary for building xds and rls on Java 9+</li>\n<li>bazel: Export deps from Maven Central-specific stand-in targets (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9780\">#9780</a>). Some Maven Central artifacts are a combination of multiple Bazel targets, like grpc-core is composed of //core:inprocess, //core:internal, //core:util, //api. There is a “//core:core_maven” target used by maven_install that uses the other targets. Previously the target used <code>runtime_deps</code> to discourage their use by Bazel users, but that could cause compilation failures from lack of hjars. These targets now use <code>exports</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cpovirk\"><code>@​cpovirk</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/niloc132\"><code>@​niloc132</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stephenh\"><code>@​stephenh</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/olderwei\"><code>@​olderwei</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pandaapo\"><code>@​pandaapo</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/panxuefeng\"><code>@​panxuefeng</code></a></p>\n<h2>v1.52.1</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Fix an internal bug in xds resource subscription that might cause xds stream not accepting response update for that resource type entirely.

this functionality is working well and can be seen in below screenshot. Showcase changes are pending next.\r\n\r\nOne problem: I had to change this config to > 1500 for UI to work, otherwise it complains query complexity too high. \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/assets/26076517/f7eb778b-1fd7-4391-be74-cef0b9aca175)\r\n\r\nDemo: (@wu-sheng btw, why are there two success rate metrics on this view?)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/assets/26076517/8fcf3236-a3de-4ad8-ace0-89c7ed936250)\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n* Optimize the splitByCharacter method by ignoring the first slash, also adds a heuristic to consider Length==1 slices to be a pattern itself, therefore always return a match (`/abc`). \r\n* Some test assertions are changed from False to True given the splitbychar update.\r\n* Trie structure is updated accordingly (basically removes the first layer which is almost always a slash), benchmark is update accordingly which shows the previous 40% perf gain is now more than 300%. \r\n\r\n```\r\nBefore:\r\n- StringToken(\"\")\r\n    - StringToken(\"FirstToken\")\r\n        - VarToken(\"{var}\")\r\n            - StringToken(\"ThirdToken\")\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n- StringToken(\"FirstToken\")\r\n    - VarToken(\"{var}\")\r\n        - StringToken(\"ThirdToken\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Bugfix:**\r\n* Atomic execution counter is getting incremented twice so the actual time is halfed, now fixed to resemble actual time.\r\n* Version was ignored thus not updated upon retrieval from remote server, now fixed to update version if different (future should check if version is larger to prevent a rewind on remote service crash).\r\n* FeedRawData grpc operation failed with illegal list access, now fixed.\r\n<!--\r\n    ⚠️ Please make sure to read this template first, pull
