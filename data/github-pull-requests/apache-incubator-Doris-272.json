Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #17065\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCooldown may cause serious performance degradation on MoW tables, temporarily disable storage policy for MoW tables.\r\n\r\n## Describe your changes.\r\n\r\n1. modify 3 java source files. check table properties before setting storage policy, if it has unique key MoW property, then throw an error and stop setting storage policy.\r\n2. add a regression-test to test if it does disable storage policy on MoW table, it includes following tests:\r\n    i. create table with storage policy on MoW table(both table and partitions)\r\n    ii. alter table to set storage policy on existing MoW table(both table and partitions)\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does it need to update dependencies\r\n* [x] Is this PR support rollback (If NO, please explain WHY)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #16313\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nDoris currently does not support SSL connection from MySQL clients, it's not secure enough in some cases, especially access Doris via the public internet.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Use TLS1.2 protocol to encrypt information.\r\n- Implementation details\r\n  * server <--- connect <--- client\r\n  * if enable SSL: {\r\n  * server <--- SSL connection request packet <--- client\r\n  * server <--- SSL Exchange ---> client } (we will add this `if` logic part in this PR)\r\n  * server ---> handshake request packet ---> client\r\n  * server <--- encrypted data ---> client (this part will be realized in this PR)\r\n- reference1

Proposed changes\r\nThis pr refactor the rewrite framework from memo to plan tree, and speed up the analyze/rewrite stage.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- abandoned memo in the analysis/rewrite stage, so that we can skip some actions, like new GroupExpression, distinct GroupExpression in the memo(high cost), update children to GroupPlan\r\n- change the most of rules to static rule, so that we can skip initialize lots of rules in Analyzer/Rewriter at every query. but some rules need context, like visitor rule, create rule at the runtime make it is easy to use, so make `custom` rule can help us to create it.\r\n- remove the `logger` field in the Job, Job are generated in large quantities at runtime, we don't need to use logger so save huge time to initialize logger.\r\n- skip some rule as far as possible, e.g. `SelectMaterializedIndexWithoutAggregate`, skip select mv if the table not exist rullup.\r\n- add some caches for frequent operation, like get Job.getDisableRules, Plan.getUnboundExpression\r\n- new bottom up rewrite rule, it can keep traverse multiple new plan which return by rules, this feature depends on `Plan.mutableState`, it is necessary to add this variable field for plan. if the plan is fully immutable, we must use withXxx to renew the plan and set the state for it, this take more runtime overhead and developing workload. another reason is we need multiple mutable state, e.g. whether is applied the rule,  whether this plan is manage by the rewrite framework. the good side of mutable state is efficient, but I suggest we don't direct use mutable state in the rule as far as possible, if we need use it, please wrap the mutable state in the framework to update and release it correctly. a good example is `AppliedAwareRuleCondition`, it can update and get the state: whether this plan is applied to a rule before.\r\n- merge some rules, invoke multiple rules in one traverse\r\n- refactor the `EliminateUnnecessaryProject` by CustomRewritor, fix the problem which eliminate some Project which decided the query output order, the case is limit(project), sort(project).\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO: add trace for new rewrite framework\r\n\r\n## Explain performance test\r\nsuite: `nereids_benchmark_p2/explain_clickbench_benchmark.groovy`\r\n\r\nresult overview:\r\n<img width=\"1324\" alt=\"image\"

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThis PR refactor the MysqlChannel and ConnectionContext,\r\nand fix memory consumption issue.\r\n\r\n1. Merge NMysqlChannel and MysqlChannel\r\n   NMysqlChannel is implemented by nio, and it is now the default and the only MysqlChannel implementation.\r\n   So we don't need it to be extended from `MysqlChannel`.\r\n   I merged all methods from `NMysqlChannel` to `MysqlChannel`, and removed the `NMysqlChannel`.\r\n\r\n2. Merge NConnectionContext and ConnectionContext\r\n    Same as `MysqlChannel`, no need two implementation, merge them into one: `ConnectionContext`.\r\n\r\n3. Fix double send buffer issue\r\n    In previous, we incorrectly allocate 2 send buffer for each mysql connection, one is in `ConnectionContext`,\r\n    and one is in `MysqlChannel`. This results in memory waste.\r\n    After merging (N)ConnectionContext and (N)MysqlChannel, this is only one send buffer\r\n\r\n4. Introduce `DummyMysqlChannel`\r\n    The real mysql channel is only needed when the connection context is a real mysql connection context.\r\n    For other senario, such as http connection, we also create a `ConnectionContext`, but should without a\r\n    real mysql channel. And because for each mysql channel, this is a 2MB send buffer, which is memory waste.\r\n    So I introduce `DummyMysqlChannel`, not only to save memory, but can also make unit test happy because\r\n    it doesn't need to check if something got from `MysqlChannel` may be NULL. \r\n\r\n5. Fix potential memory leak bug\r\n    It seems that in previous implementation of `NConnectionContext`, the `cleanup()` method doesn't call\r\n    `threadlocal.remove()`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does it need to update dependencies\r\n* [ ] Is this PR support rollback (If NO, please explain WHY)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-24T12:33:53Z","updated_at":"2023-03-24T14:19:26Z","closed_at":"2023-02-25T13:07:24Z","merged_at":"2023-02-25T13:07:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"50b423e09b201bec2c0934f441fad0a619b88f80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSupport parsing map&struct type in parquet&orc reader.\r\n\r\n## Remaining Problems\r\n1. Doris use array type to build the key and value column of a `map`, but doesn't fill the offsets in value column, so the offsets in value column is wasted.\r\n2. Parquet support reading only key or value column in `map`, this PR hasn't supported yet.\r\n3. Parquet support reading partial columns in `struct`, this PR hasn't supported yet.\r\n\r\n## Fix bugs of nested array\r\nWrong number of ancestor nulls. Change the number of ancestor nulls from `ancestor_nulls++` to `ancestor_nulls += loop_read`\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does it need to update dependencies\r\n* [ ] Is this PR support rollback (If NO, please explain WHY)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThis PR is to solve such situations:\r\n```\r\nSituation 1:\r\nReplica A is cooldown replica，cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B: cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica A: cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica A not alive, FE choose Replica B as cooldown replica\r\nReplica A alive again\r\nReplica A: update_cooldown_conf, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica A: follow_cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nAfter tablet report, FE finds all replicas' cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B, Thread1: begin follow_cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B, Thread2: update_cooldown_conf, cooldown_replica=B,  cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B, Thread3: confirm_unused_remote_files success, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=1, delete some cooldowned data of cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica B, Thread1: finish follow_cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=2, but some cooldowned data has been deleted\r\n```\r\nTo solve above situation, MUST serialize `update_cooldown_conf` and `follow_cooldown_data`. However, when there is another replica C:\r\n```\r\nSituation 2:\r\nReplica A is cooldown replica，cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B: cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica C: cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica A: cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica A not alive, FE choose Replica B as cooldown replica\r\nReplica A alive again\r\nReplica A: update_cooldown_conf, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica A: follow_cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nAfter tablet report, FE finds all replicas' cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B: update_cooldown_conf, cooldown_replica=B,  cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B: confirm_unused_remote_files success, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=1, delete some cooldowned data of cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica C: follow_cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=2, but some cooldowned data has been deleted\r\n```\r\nSeems that if we check that all replicas `cooldownReplicaId` matches this tablet's `cooldownReplicaId` when FE confirms unused remote files, this problem can be solved.\r\nConsider another situation:\r\n```\r\nSituation 3:\r\nReplica A is cooldown replica，cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B: cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica A not alive , FE choose Replica B as cooldown replica\r\nReplica A alive again\r\nReplica A, Thread 1: begin cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica A, Thread 2: update_cooldown_conf, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B: update_cooldown_conf, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nAfter tablet report, FE finds all replicas' cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica A, Thread 1: finish cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica B: confirm_unused_remote_files success, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=1, delete some cooldowned data of cooldown_meta_id=2\r\n```\r\nSo serialize `update_cooldown_conf` and `follow_cooldown_data` is not enough, we MUST serialize `update_cooldown_conf` and all operations that update cooldowned data (i.e. cold data compaction, cooldown data, follow cooldown data).\r\nHowever, if `cooldown_replica` switch back to replica A:\r\n```\r\nSituation 4:\r\n...(same with Situation 2 line 1-7)\r\nReplica A: follow_cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=B, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B not alive, FE choose Replica A as cooldown replica\r\nReplica B alive again\r\nAfter update_cooldown_conf, all replicas' state is: cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nAfter tablet report, FE finds all replicas' cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica A: confirm_unused_remote_files success, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1, delete some cooldowned data of cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica C: follow_cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=2, but some cooldowned data has been deleted\r\n```\r\nSo we need a variable that will never fall back as the watermark, and `cooldown_term` has such property. And in order to prevent replica C from following cooldown data of replica A uploaded in old cooldown term (whose cooldown_meta_id=2), we change cooldown meta path from `data/{tablet_id}/{replica_id}.meta` to `data/tablet_id/{replica_id}.{cooldown_term}.meta`.\r\nIn addition, this PR also reverses the order of `wrIte_cooldown_meta` and `save_meta` to solve such situation:\r\n```\r\nReplica A is cooldown replica, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_term=1, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica B: cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica A: cooldown_data, write_cooldown_meta, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_term=1, cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica A: restart before save_meta, cooldown_replica=null, cooldown_term=-1, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica A: update_cooldown_conf, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_term=1, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nAfter tablet report, FE finds all replicas' cooldown_term=1, cooldown_meta_id=1\r\nReplica A: confirm_unused_remote_files success, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_meta_id=1, delete some cooldowned data of cooldown_meta_id=2\r\nReplica B: follow_cooldown_data, cooldown_replica=A, cooldown_term=1, cooldown_meta_id=2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does
