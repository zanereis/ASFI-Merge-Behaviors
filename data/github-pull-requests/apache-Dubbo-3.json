[io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bom](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/tracing) from 1.3.3 to 1.3.4.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/tracing/releases\">io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.3.4</h2>\n<p>Because of issues with OTel dependencies, this release effectively downgrades</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-instrumentation-api-semconv</code> from <code>1.33.5-alpha</code> to <code>1.33.3-alpha</code></li>\n<li><code>io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api</code> from <code>1.40.0</code> to <code>1.38.0</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is because we usually don't upgrade minor versions in patch releases but since OTel does, we unintentionally upgraded <code>io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api</code> from <code>1.38.0</code> to <code>1.40.0</code> (minor version bump) in earlier patch releases since we upgraded <code>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-instrumentation-api-semconv</code> from <code>1.33.3-alpha</code> to <code>1.33.5-alpha</code> (patch version bump). A minor version bump in a patch release can be unexpected so this release restores the same minor versions of OTel that <code>1.3.0</code> used, see: <a

href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-bom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.4 deprecates <code>AsyncReporter/SpanHandler</code> <code>queuedMaxBytes</code> and disables it by default.</p>\n<p>When introduced, <code>AsyncReporter</code> had three ways to trigger a queue flush:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>queuedMaxSpans</code> - when the number of spans in the queue exceeds a threshold</li>\n<li><code>queuedMaxBytes</code> - when the size of the spans in the queue exceeds a threshold</li>\n<li><code>messageTimeout</code> - when a span has been in the queue longer than a threshold</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>queuedMaxBytes</code> was deprecated because requires time in the critical path, to calculate the size of a span to make sure it doesn't breach the threshold.

href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-bom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.4 deprecates <code>AsyncReporter/SpanHandler</code> <code>queuedMaxBytes</code> and disables it by default.</p>\n<p>When introduced, <code>AsyncReporter</code> had three ways to trigger a queue flush:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>queuedMaxSpans</code> - when the number of spans in the queue exceeds a threshold</li>\n<li><code>queuedMaxBytes</code> - when the size of the spans in the queue exceeds a

[io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bom](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/tracing) from 1.3.3 to 1.3.4.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/tracing/releases\">io.micrometer:micrometer-tracing-bom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.3.4</h2>\n<p>Because of issues with OTel dependencies, this release effectively downgrades</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-instrumentation-api-semconv</code> from <code>1.33.5-alpha</code> to <code>1.33.3-alpha</code></li>\n<li><code>io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api</code> from <code>1.40.0</code> to <code>1.38.0</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is because we usually don't upgrade minor versions in patch releases but since OTel does, we unintentionally upgraded <code>io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api</code> from <code>1.38.0</code> to <code>1.40.0</code> (minor version bump) in earlier patch releases since we upgraded <code>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation:opentelemetry-instrumentation-api-semconv</code> from <code>1.33.3-alpha</code> to <code>1.33.5-alpha</code> (patch version bump). A minor version bump in a patch release can be unexpected so this release restores the same minor versions of OTel that <code>1.3.0</code> used, see: <a

href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-bom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.4 deprecates <code>AsyncReporter/SpanHandler</code> <code>queuedMaxBytes</code> and disables it by default.</p>\n<p>When introduced, <code>AsyncReporter</code> had three ways to trigger a queue flush:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>queuedMaxSpans</code> - when the number of spans in the queue exceeds a threshold</li>\n<li><code>queuedMaxBytes</code> - when the size of the spans in the queue exceeds a threshold</li>\n<li><code>messageTimeout</code> - when a span has been in the queue longer than a threshold</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>queuedMaxBytes</code> was deprecated because requires time in the critical path, to calculate the size of a span to make sure it doesn't breach the threshold.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

deadlock issue during the startup process related to the Raft protocol initialization in version 2.4.1 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12526\">#12526</a>). It also rolls back the changes made in version 2.4.1 that lowered the hessian version, which caused startup problems on JDK 17+ versions due to conflicts with hessian dependencies. Additionally, the logic for checking ServerStatus has been optimized to prevent issues from affecting the availability of non-Raft-dependent functionalities due to Raft election failures.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this version includes several usability enhancements and addresses some other bugs.</p>\n<p>Please see the details of the changes below:</p>\n<h1>Change details</h1>\n<h2>Enhancement&amp;Refactor</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12483\">#12483</a> Configuration list adds configuration format.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12547\">#12547</a> Nacos client supports desensitise in logging.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12555\">#12555</a> SwitchManager support http、tcp、mysql HealthParams and pushCSharpVersion update.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12569\">#12569</a> Enhance is exist table logic to support more database.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12573\">#12573</a> Enhance Server status check to avoid affect core features.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12583\">#12583</a> Enhance protocolManager lock logic.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12608\">#12608</a> Enhance configs diff, support to collapse identical rows.</p>\n<h2>BugFix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12093\">#12093</a> Fix reset password success but no message.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12498\">#12498</a><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12503\">#12503</a> Revert &quot;Resolve the Hessian package conflict issue.

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-06T15:21:00Z","updated_at":"2024-09-07T01:11:08Z","closed_at":"2024-09-07T01:11:08Z","merged_at":"2024-09-07T01:11:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"a25b21facd6ad74a4116424a74c8a0baf7a80d18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14644/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14644/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14644/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2807aee88edf46eee22006b19aeb2dac354a8804","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0906-basic","ref":"0906-basic","sha":"2807aee88edf46eee22006b19aeb2dac354a8804","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-06T14:49:30Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T16:15:15Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T16:15:15Z","merged_at":"2024-09-06T16:15:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"08c74b79d254426351062560f5e5c00e02275517","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14643/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14643/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14643/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7c6c5eb9b93941fba8f81d13faa47d51d0d1ef52","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-fix-stream-close","ref":"3.2-fix-stream-close","sha":"7c6c5eb9b93941fba8f81d13faa47d51d0d1ef52","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-05T09:14:25Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T12:48:04Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T09:17:48Z","merged_at":"2024-09-05T09:17:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"45c007c3b2a8e7e9f73ce6fae32bd8f600904481","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/24f7259f1798b8a1cbdf4b1353de3076f6c9021e","head":{"label":"oxsean:fix-header-names","ref":"fix-header-names","sha":"24f7259f1798b8a1cbdf4b1353de3076f6c9021e","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-05T09:07:50Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T01:37:19Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T01:37:19Z","merged_at":"2024-09-06T01:37:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"ac6704d532ca814dbf989dd20ea31716eabc6990","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0a7e4b4aa459293a972ef251a9938968937ff5ee","head":{"label":"he-jialin2:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"0a7e4b4aa459293a972ef251a9938968937ff5ee","user":{"login":"he-jialin2","id":10741182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10741182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2","html_url":"https://github.com/he-jialin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":852694233,"node_id":"R_kgDOMtMU2Q","name":"dubbo","full_name":"he-jialin2/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"he-jialin2","id":10741182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQxMTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10741182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2","html_url":"https://github.com/he-jialin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/he-jialin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/he-jialin2/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-05T02:04:11Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T02:04:19Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T02:04:18Z","merged_at":"2024-09-05T02:04:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"99395bd0a8c207fd011f5657df2370b26cd170b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/eb08fe5dc2595fd4380c9784b8146280c95d2649","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0905-scheduled","ref":"0905-scheduled","sha":"eb08fe5dc2595fd4380c9784b8146280c95d2649","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache
