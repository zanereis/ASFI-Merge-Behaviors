What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the TtlValueState#update will wrap the user value with timestamp and proxy request to the original value state. It does not check the null value, which violates the description of the base interface. This PR fixes this by enforcing null value check before wrapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - check the null value before wrapping in TtlValueState#update\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added test case `testValueSetNull` in `TtlStateTestBase.java`, and make the value of `TtlValueStateTestContext` be `Long` to throw exception when serializing null.  \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **yes**\r\n  -

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds support for consuming multiple subpartitions in a single input channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Separate the notion of subpartition and channel in terms of naming, signature and comments.\r\n- Union the output from multiple subpartitions with one ResultSubpartitionView and TierConsumerAgent\r\n- Control the partial record split logic when writing buffers into subpartition to avoid potential deadlocks\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Extended HybridShuffleITCase to cover cases when the feature proposed in this PR comes into effect.\r\n- Added unit tests for newly introduced options and classes\r\n- Manually verified situations that are not covered by e2e tests, like when tiered hybrid shuffle uses sort buffer.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-14T02:16:00Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:21Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a5ea6094ac83a6904aa4e3dd6df32845f1098e21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23924/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23924/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23924/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a6d6662bc551b60b528c863217219379fa415b0d","head":{"label":"cuibo01:FLINK-33809","ref":"FLINK-33809","sha":"a6d6662bc551b60b528c863217219379fa415b0d","user":{"login":"cuibo01","id":36881649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODgxNjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36881649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01","html_url":"https://github.com/cuibo01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":332116277,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzIxMTYyNzc=","name":"flink","full_name":"cuibo01/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cuibo01","id":36881649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODgxNjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36881649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01","html_url":"https://github.com/cuibo01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuibo01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cuibo01/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for WindowDeduplicate node*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for WindowDeduplicate node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n [FLINK-33798][statebackend/rocksdb] automatically clean up rocksdb logs when the task exited.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nWhen the task exits, delete all rocksdb log files with the same prefix in the relocated directory.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- org.apache.flink.contrib.streaming.state.RocksDBStateBackendConfigTest#testCleanRelocatedDbLogs\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces RecordAttributes that contain information about whether the data is backlog.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for WindowJoin node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for WindowJoin node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix NullArgumentException of getQuantile method in DescriptiveStatisticsHistogramStatistics\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis DescriptiveStatisticsHistogramStatistics class has added null initialization\r\n1、DescriptiveStatisticsHistogramStatistics.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n<img width=\"845\" alt=\"3799e5aae7fa3cc0500aa1cd0b06856\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/28818582/f498c368-0766-4cb1-adff-bb77abf5cda9\">\r\n\r\nDuring the verification process, the task was submitted to Yarn and run in Yarn cluster mode. After multiple stops and restarts, it was found that the NullArgumentException exception had disappeared. This fully verified the correctness of the modification, improved the stability of program operation, and also improved the accuracy of displaying statistical information in the web UI interface of the Flink task (as shown in the above figure).\r\nThe highlighted log section in the above figure is the log I printed to assist in troubleshooting, which can be ignored.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (no)","created_at":"2023-12-12T16:31:00Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:30Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T11:54:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1480d3aba9f50700ce5d16f668464e188b0f8d83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2ef449fc1eadc0fd271078ba287b479c005fa3c3","head":{"label":"zhutong6688:FLINK-33588","ref":"FLINK-33588","sha":"2ef449fc1eadc0fd271078ba287b479c005fa3c3","user":{"login":"zhutong6688","id":28818582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODE4NTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28818582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688","html_url":"https://github.com/zhutong6688","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":659641932,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ1FWTA","name":"flink","full_name":"zhutong6688/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhutong6688","id":28818582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODE4NTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28818582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688","html_url":"https://github.com/zhutong6688","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhutong6688/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhutong6688/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33641][test] Suppress the DirectoryNotEmptyException in StreamingWithStateTestBase to prevent test failures\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nSuppress the DirectoryNotEmptyException in StreamingWithStateTestBase to prevent test failures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-12T15:57:44Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:31Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T09:30:18Z","merged_at":"2023-12-14T09:30:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2b8323ccd931be85dbaa6542552c26e6a29a105","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23914/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23914/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23914/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/be949ea191f0a22660860f40f185ec8083f768b6","head":{"label":"Jiabao-Sun:FLINK-33641","ref":"FLINK-33641","sha":"be949ea191f0a22660860f40f185ec8083f768b6","user":{"login":"Jiabao-Sun","id":27403841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDAzODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27403841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":362033666,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjIwMzM2NjY=","name":"flink","full_name":"Jiabao-Sun/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jiabao-Sun","id":27403841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDAzODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27403841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMixin based implementation for [FLIP-372](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-372%3A+Allow+TwoPhaseCommittingSink+WithPreCommitTopology+to+alter+the+type+of+the+Committable)\r\n\r\nFor now, just checking backward compatibility of the API changes\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Moving inner classes to main classes:\r\n    - `CommitterInitContext` from `Sink.CommitterInitContext` \r\n    - `CommittingSinkWriter` from `TwoPhaseCommittingSink.PrecommittingSinkWriter`\r\n    -  `StatefulSinkWriter` from `StatefulSink.StatefulSinkWriter`\r\n    - `WriterInitContext` from `Sink.InitContext`\r\n- Moving to mixin interfaces:\r\n   - `SupportsCommitter` from `TwoPhaseCommittingSink`\r\n   - `SupportsWriterState` from `StatefulSink`\r\n   - `SupportsPostCommitTopology` from `WithPostCommitToplogy`\r\n   - `SupportsPreCommitTopology` from `WithPreCommitTopology`\r\n   - `SupportsPreWriteTopology` from `WithPreWriteTopology`\r\n- Deprecation methods with default implementations\r\n- Few internal changes to make everything work\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe CI will run all the tests to see if the change breaks anything\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not documented\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-12T14:56:19Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:33Z","closed_at":"2024-01-24T16:35:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7b4dd02e639cc7c74fdda7366b4c1ee876c3bea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273210700,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjEwNzAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Common","name":"component=Connectors/Common","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/98fdb7994b9cee4b560c68ee82ecd45e0059822c","head":{"label":"pvary:mixin_demo","ref":"mixin_demo","sha":"98fdb7994b9cee4b560c68ee82ecd45e0059822c","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":530236271,"node_id":"R_kgDOH5rDbw","name":"flink","full_name":"pvary/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pvary/flink","description":"Apache

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change is to make `miniCluster.close()` run only once after all tests finish and make the tests in test class `ClientHeartbeatTest` run faster. There are three tests in this test class. They are trying to submit different jobs through the cluster and assert the running status of `miniCluster` or the job status of submitted job. These tests are submitting jobs that are not related to each other. We also try to run these tests in different orders and they always pass.\r\n\r\nBesides, test class `ClientHeartbeatTest` is similar to the test class `org.apache.flink.runtime.leaderelection.LeaderChangeClusterComponentsTest`. However, test class \r\n`LeaderChangeClusterComponentsTest` only close the `miniCluster` after all tests finish. It is a good choice to apply similar approach to the test class `ClientHeartbeatTest`.\r\n\r\nThe test runtime can change from `9.9113 s` to `8.9771 s` after applying this change.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- This pull request changes the code such that `miniCluster.close()` run once after all tests finish rather than run after every test.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\nThis pull request is just modifying tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no","created_at":"2023-12-12T05:17:50Z","updated_at":"2023-12-15T04:15:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29cb8e588f18aafe730c23ec89b0988790a38d89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"reswqa","id":19502505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTAyNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19502505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa","html_url":"https://github.com/reswqa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reswqa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b0fd64a2a24dc1cd50ea2fb5ae4f3d4036e2b85a","head":{"label":"TestBoost:master","ref":"master","sha":"b0fd64a2a24dc1cd50ea2fb5ae4f3d4036e2b85a","user":{"login":"TestBoost","id":153348110,"node_id":"U_kgDOCSPoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153348110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost","html_url":"https://github.com/TestBoost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":730509322,"node_id":"R_kgDOK4qwCg","name":"flink","full_name":"TestBoost/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TestBoost","id":153348110,"node_id":"U_kgDOCSPoDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153348110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost","html_url":"https://github.com/TestBoost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TestBoost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TestBoost/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\nChange log level for Application CANCELED/FAILED logs from INFO to WARN\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Change log level for Application CANCELED/FAILED logs from INFO to WARN*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-11T13:24:15Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:36Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c56ef55cf29ce06405937ce8514bfe8bd29c013a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23907/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23907/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23907/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2afa8152962696d6f18bee5061b634fcbd6999ea","head":{"label":"ashangit:nfraison/FLINK-33797","ref":"nfraison/FLINK-33797","sha":"2afa8152962696d6f18bee5061b634fcbd6999ea","user":{"login":"ashangit","id":6404013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDQwMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6404013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit","html_url":"https://github.com/ashangit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49020520,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTAyMDUyMA==","name":"flink","full_name":"ashangit/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashangit","id":6404013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDQwMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6404013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit","html_url":"https://github.com/ashangit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashangit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashangit/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAfter [FLINK-33713](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33713), we have deprecated the use of `RuntimeContext#getExecutionConfig`.\r\n\r\nUpdate the documentation about the usage of `RuntimeContext#getExecutionConfig`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate the documentation about the usage of RuntimeContext#getExecutionConfig.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-11T09:51:17Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:37Z","closed_at":"2023-12-12T07:28:54Z","merged_at":"2023-12-12T07:28:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"3531998adad20f3904d1421a35a69fef44b2b69f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d0e0c3f21c75b2cecff6ee010c4ddd6e10906ed4","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:FLIP-391_update_doc","ref":"FLIP-391_update_doc","sha":"d0e0c3f21c75b2cecff6ee010c4ddd6e10906ed4","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-11T02:36:21Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:39Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8f332c6f14b4a31bffb28f54a5f9119b649c60af","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:FLINK-32667","ref":"FLINK-32667","sha":"8f332c6f14b4a31bffb28f54a5f9119b649c60af","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nsetting pycharm for pyflink project - fixing from going to reference (which dosn't exist) to settings\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- doc text update - changed preference to settings \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nno test required for this\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-10T14:38:41Z","updated_at":"2024-04-01T09:26:11Z","closed_at":"2024-04-01T09:26:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe305109a46182f76dbaea70e48c1af79a794545","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23902/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23902/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9aa16ee84df15f6ae747852ec0ee269d877a2016","head":{"label":"Gianzie:master","ref":"master","sha":"9aa16ee84df15f6ae747852ec0ee269d877a2016","user":{"login":"Gianzie","id":63688853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjg4ODUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63688853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie","html_url":"https://github.com/Gianzie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gianzie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"28762497bdf574855e4a9293f22ce80e6c7f9002","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*The PR is about to replace deprecated StreamTableEnvironment#toRetractDataStream with StreamTableEnvironment#toChangelogStream as mentioned in javadoc*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-08T10:30:43Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23898/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23898/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23898/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e20a0db58c67c0db7de117012dac9bf4a8c2af6d","head":{"label":"liuyongvs:deprecate_retract_stream","ref":"deprecate_retract_stream","sha":"e20a0db58c67c0db7de117012dac9bf4a8c2af6d","user":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":278584612,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzg1ODQ2MTI=","name":"flink","full_name":"liuyongvs/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Replace the usage of deprecated org.apache.flink.table.api.TableConfig#ctor()\r\n with getDefault() *\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-08T08:18:12Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:45Z","closed_at":"2023-12-14T01:20:15Z","merged_at":"2023-12-14T01:20:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb02698dee078446500d94246acf6b162a2b7924","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23897/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23897/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23897/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1855b4c16c66c402a2642377e8c641355bcaa362","head":{"label":"liuyongvs:deprecate_table_config","ref":"deprecate_table_config","sha":"1855b4c16c66c402a2642377e8c641355bcaa362","user":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":278584612,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzg1ODQ2MTI=","name":"flink","full_name":"liuyongvs/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Replace the usage of deprecated org.apache.flink.table.api.internal.BaseExpressions#cast(TypeInformation) with cast(DataType)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Cleanup usage of deprecated org.apache.flink.table.api.internal.BaseExpressions#cast(TypeInformation) *\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n* original unit test *\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-08T08:04:45Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:47Z","closed_at":"2023-12-15T22:59:10Z","merged_at":"2023-12-15T22:59:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"ef2b626d67147797e992ec3b338bafdb4e5ab1c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23895/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23895/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23895/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/129bf88c74d9b48f944af6a4aa1bce5289e5ea93","head":{"label":"liuyongvs:deprecate_cast","ref":"deprecate_cast","sha":"129bf88c74d9b48f944af6a4aa1bce5289e5ea93","user":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":278584612,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzg1ODQ2MTI=","name":"flink","full_name":"liuyongvs/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Replace the usage of deprecated org.apache.flink.table.api.TableConfig#setIdleStateRetentionTime(Time, Time)\r\nwith setIdleStateRetentionTime(Duration)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Cleanup usage of deprecated TableConfig#setIdleStateRetentionTime(Time, Time) *\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n* original unit test *\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-08T07:55:20Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:48Z","closed_at":"2023-12-18T11:41:04Z","merged_at":"2023-12-18T11:41:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c86dcadf5366fa0026125051d69b0a8913d5e61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xuyangzhong","id":25195874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTk1ODc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25195874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyangzhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyangzhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23894/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23894/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23894/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a6a089410a462b55915d0619e627d7743bca9f3c","head":{"label":"liuyongvs:deprecated_retention","ref":"deprecated_retention","sha":"a6a089410a462b55915d0619e627d7743bca9f3c","user":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":278584612,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzg1ODQ2MTI=","name":"flink","full_name":"liuyongvs/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n*Fix GroupAggregate Restore Test*\r\n- This commit ca1c7ce48127472a7c7965099f8a7227549f09df has updated the logic to generate the primary key name while generating the compiled plan\r\n- This commit updates/regenerates the plans to have updated primary key names\r\n- Related commit: 193b1c68976cdfbd66147278f23d7d427d9b5562\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Existing restore tests verify the change*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-07T20:46:55Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:49Z","closed_at":"2023-12-08T13:42:03Z","merged_at":"2023-12-08T13:42:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e515dce78832dbbbf5fce9c8cdd113bbb62cdf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9bbd9364992de373ce006e13d7302a63863a00b4","head":{"label":"bvarghese1:fix_group_agg_restore_tests","ref":"fix_group_agg_restore_tests","sha":"9bbd9364992de373ce006e13d7302a63863a00b4","user":{"login":"bvarghese1","id":10199670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk5Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10199670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1","html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":639592192,"node_id":"R_kgDOJh9nAA","name":"flink","full_name":"bvarghese1/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bvarghese1","id":10199670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk5Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10199670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1","html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen reading the code about json format, I found the test classes `JsonRowDeserializationSchemaTest` and `JsonRowSerializationSchemaTest` are missed to migrate to junit5.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nsee: [FLINK-33759](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33759)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently, submitting a job starts with storing the JobGraph (in HA setups) in the JobGraphStore. This includes writing the file to S3 (or some other remote file system). The job submission is done in the Dispatcher's main thread. If writing the JobGraph is slow, it would block any other operation on the Dispatcher.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *The dispatcher put JobGraph asynchronously in ioExecutor*\r\n  - *The dispatcher write To ExecutionGraphInfoStore asynchronously in ioExecutor*\r\n  - *The JobGraphWriter interface class adds a putJobGraphAsync method for asynchronous write operations*\r\n  - *Implementation class DefaultJobGraphStore adds the putJobGraphAsync method for asynchronous write operations*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added  the Dispatcher JobSubmission test, use ZooKeeperStateHandleStore as JobGraphStore*\r\n  - *Added  the Dispatcher JobSubmission test, use KubernetesStateHandleStore as JobGraphStore*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is the a revisited non-breaking implementation of [FLIP-371: Provide initialization context for Committer creation in TwoPhaseCommittingSink](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-371%3A+Provide+initialization+context+for+Committer+creation+in+TwoPhaseCommittingSink).\r\n\r\nReverts the previous version [c3a07f98e5d1d7624adc967932f57d31355d9ddd](https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/c3a07f98e5d1d7624adc967932f57d31355d9ddd) with [50da9518e05bd0fe821f09e997582867bed5022a](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23876/commits/50da9518e05bd0fe821f09e997582867bed5022a) and [df9bd52593d33e0358eefd3008588084abe17b56](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23876/commits/df9bd52593d33e0358eefd3008588084abe17b56). Then adds the new implementation [a51eff4e2de3f80de61fb45fee81f0de68fd0af3](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23876/commits/a51eff4e2de3f80de61fb45fee81f0de68fd0af3) based on the [discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread/h6nkgth838dlh5s90sd95zd6hlsxwx57) on the mailing list.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAPI changes:\r\n- `TwoPhaseCommittingSink` - new `createCommitter` method with default implementation and deprecation\r\n- `CommitterInitContext` - new object for committer initialization and metrics\r\n- `SinkCommitterMetricGroup` - new metrics group for committer related metrics\r\n- `Sink.createWriter` - parameter changed to `WriterInitContext` with default implementation and deprecation\r\n- `StatefulSink.createWriter` and `TwoPhaseCommittingSink.createWriter` method declarations are removed - and they fall back to the `Sink.createWriter`, which is backward compatible, since the return type is wider\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\n- `InitContext` - new common context base class for `CommitterInitContext` and `WriterInitContext`\r\n- `WriterInitContext` - replacement for `Sink.InitContext`\r\n- `CommitterInitContext` - new context for committer creation\r\n- `InitContextBase` - the common base for the `WriterInitContext` and `CommitterInitContext` implementation\r\n- `Sink.createWriter(InitContext context)` is deprecated in favour of `createWriter(WriterInitContext context)` with default implementation\r\n- `Sink.createWriter(WriterInitContext context)` is created with default implementation which wraps the `WriterInitContext` with `InitContextWrapper` to the old `Sink.InitContext` and calls the original method\r\n- `StatefulSink.createWriter` and the `TwoPhaseCommitingSink.createWriter` methods are removed - they fall back to the `Sink.createWriter` method which is backward compatible\r\n- `SinkWriterOperator` - to follow the `WriterInitContext` related changes\r\n- `StatefulSinkWriterStateHandler` - Here we check if the writer created by `createWriter` is a `StatefulSinkWriter`\r\n- `InternalSinkCommitterMetricGroup` - implementation for `SinkCommitterMetricGroup`\r\n- `CommitterOperator` - to create the `CommitterInitContext` and `SinkCommitterMetricGroup`. And modify the initialization to  use the new `Committer` creation method, and create the metrics group\r\n- Updating the metrics in the `CommitRequestImpl` and `CheckpointCommittableManagerImpl`\r\n- Propagate the new metricGroup object to finally arrive to the `CommitRequestImpl` where we need it (`CommiterOperator` -> `CommittableCollector` -> `CheckpointCommittableManagerImpl` -> `SubtaskCommittableManager` -> `SubtaskCommittableManager` -> `CommitRequestImpl`)\r\n- SinkAdapterV1 changes to use the new Committer and writer creation method, and metrics group (`SinkAdapterV1`, `GlobalCommitterSerializer`, `GlobalCommitterOperator`)\r\n- Updating the tests to propagate the metric group\r\n- Adding a new test case to `SinkV2MetricsITCase` to make sure that the metrics are propagated as expected.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit test, and modified the old ones to use the new method.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not documented - might be worth to check the documentation of SinkV2 if it is exists, to update it.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-05T14:30:25Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:01:05Z","closed_at":"2023-12-12T13:30:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"103d3ec638d50c97e8455f052ad6b4fb6a14cb38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273210700,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjEwNzAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Common","name":"component=Connectors/Common","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23876/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23876/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23876/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a51eff4e2de3f80de61fb45fee81f0de68fd0af3","head":{"label":"pvary:compat_fix","ref":"compat_fix","sha":"a51eff4e2de3f80de61fb45fee81f0de68fd0af3","user":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":530236271,"node_id":"R_kgDOH5rDbw","name":"flink","full_name":"pvary/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pvary","id":19705742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzA1NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19705742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary","html_url":"https://github.com/pvary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pvary/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we use the Flink operator and configure the PodTemplate, and the resource configuration of the PodTemplate is different from the resources calculated by Flink, the Flink framework itself will take the resources calculated by Flink configuration. \r\nWhen we encounter the following scenarios:\r\n1. If I want to create a pod with Graranted QoS and want the memory of the Flink main container to be larger than the process size of Flink, I cannot directly modify podTemplate (although we can use limit factor, this will cause the QoS to change from Graranted to Burstable)\r\n2. If I want to create a pod with Burstable QoS, I don't want to use limit actor and want to directly configure the request to be 50% of the limit, which cannot be modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR change the logic inside package flink-kubernetes, with class KubernetesUtils.class 's method getResourceRequirements. I change the priority of resource definition of pod which is only changed by flink configuration, and now if podTemplate has configuration of pod's resources then it is valid, which podTemplate's resources will override the resources configuration of flink.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) yes, it may affect job on kubernetes which has wrong podTemplates that will lead to an resources error of k8s.\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently, submitting a job starts with storing the JobGraph (in HA setups) in the JobGraphStore. This includes writing the file to S3 (or some other remote file system). The job submission is done in the Dispatcher's main thread. If writing the JobGraph is slow, it would block any other operation on the Dispatcher.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *The ZooKeeperStateHandleStore create path in ZooKeeper and locks it then write asynchronously state in Executor*\r\n  - *The KubernetesStateHandleStore stores key in ConfigMap and write asynchronously state in Executor*\r\n  - *The dispatcher put JobGraph asynchronously in ioExecutor *\r\n  - *The dispatcher write To ExecutionGraphInfoStore asynchronously in ioExecutor *\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added  the Dispatcher JobSubmission test, use ZooKeeperStateHandleStore as JobGraphStore*\r\n  - *Added  the Dispatcher JobSubmission test, use KubernetesStateHandleStore as JobGraphStore*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDeprecate configuration getters/setters that return/set complex Java objects in python flink.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Deprecate getter/setter methods related to state backend in python flink.*\r\n  - *Deprecate getter/setter methods related to CheckpointStorage in python flink.*\r\n  - *Deprecate getter/setter methods related in the RestartStrategy in python flink.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is a org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.failover.flip1 package.\r\n\r\nI propose rename the failover.flip1 to failover, in the other word: removing the flip1. I have 2 reasons:\r\n\r\n- The naming of the package should be based on business semantics, not FLIP number, and the code under the failover.flip1 package has also many changes after FLIP-1.\r\n- All code under the failover.flip1 package are Internal code instead of `@Public` code, so they can be renamed directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33731][Scheduler] Remove the redundant flip1 package\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):  no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently  `CollectResultFetcher` uses a fixed retry interval. This can be improved with `IncrementalDelayRetryStrategy`.  `IncrementalDelayRetryStrategy` is a balance between job E2E latency and request count.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Use `IncrementalDelayRetryStrategy` in `CollectResultFetcher` to decide the retry interval  between requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests `CollectResultFetcherRetryITCase` to test the `CollectResultFetcher` retry behavior\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a job is configured to run with incremental checkpoint disabled, user manually triggers an incremental checkpoint actually triggering a full checkpoint. That is because the files from full checkpoint cannot be shared with an incremental checkpoint. This PR removes the \"INCREMENTAL\" option in triggering checkpoint from REST API and throw exception if user tried to avoid misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Throw exception in ```org.apache.flink.runtime.rest.handler.job.checkpoints.CheckpointHandlers```\r\n - Remove the 'INCREMENTAL' options in docs\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n - Added unit test ```CheckpointHandlersTest#testDisallowTriggeringIncrementalCheckpoint``` for this case.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce new Flink conf file 'config.yaml' supporting standard YAML syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce new Flink conf file 'config.yaml' supporting standard YAML syntax.*\r\n  - *Change the UT case to use new conf file.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request decouples shuffle network memory and job topology which resolves the [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33668)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Redefines the redistribution logic of the NetworkBufferPool.\r\n  - Make the shuffle read and write components work with a small buffer pool.\r\n  - Adds a config to enable this feature.\r\n  - Avoids a potential deadlock. It happens when there are not enough segments in the global buffer pool, while an InputGate is reserving segments, so it needs to wait for another LBP destroyed. Destroying a LBP will cause a redistribution over all LBPs, which requires the same lock during reserving segments, so a deadlock happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Buffer pool redistribution can allocate buffers with the expected number as the weight and make sure it is between the min and the max value.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFLINK-21945 will convert the unaligned checkpoint barrier and timeoutable aligned checkpoint barrier to force aligned barrier. However, Force aligned barrier logic doesn't work for  timeoutable aligned checkpoint barrier.\r\n\r\nBug at org.apache.flink.streaming.runtime.io.RecordWriterOutput#broadcastEvent, we will call withUnalignedUnsupported to convert the unaligned checkpoint barrier to FORCED_ALIGNED barrier when the supportsUnalignedCheckpoints is false.\r\n\r\nHowever, the if has one condition: isPriorityEvent. When  aligned checkpoint timeout is enabled, flink will emit one timeoutable barrier. It isn't PriorityEvent.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33693][checkpoint] Force aligned barrier works with timeoutable aligned checkpoint barrier\r\n\r\n- Remove the condition: isPriorityEvent\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test: `RecordWriterOutputTest#testDisableUnalignedCheckpoint`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):

What is the purpose of the change\r\nSupport plan cache for DQL in SQL Gateway, so that we could reuse the plan and save time on SQL parsing, validation, and optimization.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Add a PlanCacheManager to save the cached plan.\r\n  - Gateway may reuse the plan in PlanCacheManager when execute a DQL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Add test cases in SqlGatewayServiceStatementITCase, and all these new DQL will execute for twice with plan cache enabled to ensure that plan cache works well.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDeprecate RuntimeContext#getExecutionConfig, and introduce the alternative getter methods createSerializer(TypeInformation<T> typeInformation), getGlobalJobParameters() and isObjectReuseEnabled().\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Deprecate RuntimeContext#getExecutionConfig*\r\n  - *Introduce alternative getter methods createSerializer(TypeInformation<T> typeInformation), getGlobalJobParameters() and isObjectReuseEnabled().*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAfter the deprecation of complex Java object getter and setter methods in FLIP-381, Flink now recommends the use of ConfigOptions for the configuration of RestartStrategy, Checkpoint Storage, and State Backend. It is necessary that we update FLINK documentation to clearly instruct users on this new recommended approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Update the usage of configuring state backend in docs.\r\n  - Update the usage of configuring checkpoint storage in docs.\r\n  - Update the usage of configuring restart strategy in docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-30T12:27:42Z","updated_at":"2023-12-06T07:53:20Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23842/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23842/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23842/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f371c23cb649a4f42b33b18562aa10d7dca296f3","head":{"label":"caodizhou:batch_deploy","ref":"batch_deploy","sha":"f371c23cb649a4f42b33b18562aa10d7dca296f3","user":{"login":"caodizhou","id":22467904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDY3OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22467904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou","html_url":"https://github.com/caodizhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":709302752,"node_id":"R_kgDOKkcZ4A","name":"flink","full_name":"caodizhou/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"caodizhou","id":22467904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDY3OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22467904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou","html_url":"https://github.com/caodizhou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caodizhou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/caodizhou/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change configures the the GCS client used by the GSFileSystem's RecoverableWriter codepath to use the same GCS root URL as used by Hadoop.\r\n\r\nWithout this change, the GSFileSystem behaves differently depending on context if this config option is set—for instance, FileSource will use the overridden URL while FileSink will not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Update GSFileSystemFactory/GSFileSystemOptions to look for the gs.storage.root.url Flink config option, overriding the GCS client's Host option if it is set\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added one test to ensure the GCS SDK `Storage` client's `Host` option is overridden when the `gs.storage.root.url` Flink config option is set\r\n- Built the plugin and used it with an otherwise-vanilla Flink deployment and successfully used FileSink to write to an instance of fake-gcs-server\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable (previously-documented behavior for overriding the GCS root URL was not actually supported, but will be with this change)\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-30T09:35:29Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:01:38Z","closed_at":"2024-01-18T17:21:46Z","merged_at":"2024-01-18T17:21:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"a41229b24d82e8c561350c42d8a98dfb865c3f69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278672464,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4NjcyNDY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=FileSystems","name":"component=FileSystems","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c60697980c15b0037d4a8dd91167e0a4aee3e1c8","head":{"label":"patricklucas:FLINK-33694_gs_fs_host","ref":"FLINK-33694_gs_fs_host","sha":"c60697980c15b0037d4a8dd91167e0a4aee3e1c8","user":{"login":"patricklucas","id":95053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas","html_url":"https://github.com/patricklucas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80867820,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDg2NzgyMA==","name":"flink","full_name":"patricklucas/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"patricklucas","id":95053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MDUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas","html_url":"https://github.com/patricklucas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patricklucas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/patricklucas/flink","description":"Mirror

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-30T09:19:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T10:14:01Z","closed_at":"2023-12-01T10:14:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb1409b563e7be857fb26ae7cc82e03b143bd847","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6164e32c9cf2546ae994950fd170201e43e7713d","head":{"label":"jiangxin369:refactor-redistribute","ref":"refactor-redistribute","sha":"6164e32c9cf2546ae994950fd170201e43e7713d","user":{"login":"jiangxin369","id":21049075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ5MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21049075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxin369","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":333335437,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzMzMzU0Mzc=","name":"flink","full_name":"jiangxin369/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxin369","id":21049075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ5MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21049075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxin369","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxin369/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCommand description for optimizing document construction\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCommand description for optimizing document construction\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?
