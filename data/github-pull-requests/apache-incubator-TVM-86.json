Though the BYOC flow is supported with the TVM C++ runtime, this support depends heavily on `dlsym` and shared library support, neither of which are required to use the TVM C runtime.\r\n\r\nThis PR can roughly be thought of in these parts:\r\n - Build a corresponding `runtime.CreateLLVMCrtMetadataModule` PackedFunc to the `runtime.CreateCSourceCrtMetadataModule`. Also add `crt` here to distinguish between these metadata modules (which are intended to be compiled) and runtime::MetadataModule (which is intended to be directly loaded into the TVM compiler c++ runtime)\r\n - Move FuncRegistry and TVMSystemLibEntryPoint LLVM generator into a new LLVMModule instance. Change function registry to declare extern functions rather than using internal linkage.\r\n - Allow `tvm.micro.build_static_runtime` to accept object files from the LLVM backend. This temporarily solution allows us to build `llvm`-targeted code using microTVM.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-03T00:58:40Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T22:53:54Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T17:54:43Z","merged_at":"2021-02-23T17:54:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ba37411aa7d2fb3753e2403f8cbf0cf1e878ec6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7398/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7398/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7398/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ce38ed10e873df511288e43db55caf08d3f57cca","head":{"label":"areusch:llvm-metadata-module","ref":"llvm-metadata-module","sha":"ce38ed10e873df511288e43db55caf08d3f57cca","user":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251458757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTE0NTg3NTc=","name":"tvm","full_name":"areusch/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/areusch/tvm","description":"Open

PR adds deform_conv to PT Frontend. It also fixes a bug in bilinear interpolation which was causing wrong output with deformable convolutions from PT framework. The \"bug\" occurs when one or more the interpolation index(y, x) is outside one or more of the boundary points `(y_max, x_max)`, but within `(y_max + 1, x_max + 1)`. In the current implementation both interpolation source points are on the boundary even if the point is closer to one or more of `(y_max+1, x_max+1)`.  In the corrected version, the first point is on the boundary and the second point value is 0 which is more logically sound and matches with how [frameworks have implemented it.](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/test/test_ops.py#L222) \r\nPS : It might seem that this is a corner case, but it really changes the accuracy by a lot \r\nFor e.g: Without this change , the relative and absolute tolerances are around 1 and 1e-2 with tolerances being more than 1e-2 for 25-40% of the output elements in deformable convolution. \r\n\r\nSince ROI align is dependent on this change, I have made the corresponding necessary changes in ROIAlign and verified that it works like before as expected.

tuning workload using AutoTVM, we may encounter an exception saying `< not supported between instances of function and function`. The reason is we currently put RPC requests in the format of `(-priority, time.time(), callback)`. When two requests with the same `priority` and `time.time()`, then heap pop throws the error of trying to compare two callbacks. Although it seems rare to have the same timestamp for two requests, one of my colleagues encounters an exception repeatedly when tuning a task using AutoTVM on V100 GPU. As a result, I try to use a counter to replace the timestamp so that we guarantee there's no duplication. Not sure if we need thread locking here to make sure thread safe, tho.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @FrozenGene

is my proposed solution to add While loop like feature to TIR, in the simplest, the least invasive way. It generalizes the For node termination condition from\r\n```\r\nloop_var < extent\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nloop_var < extent && test\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this, we can write binary search as follows (see the complete test case, which implements numpy `searchsorted` function, [here](https://github.com/masahi/tvm/blob/a1b2c4a57e136186165e54bb1148faa44ad0a899/tests/python/unittest/test_tir_ir_builder.py#L176)).\r\n```\r\nlo[0] = 0\r\nhi[0] = n\r\nv = Bptr[i]\r\nnum_loop = int(np.log2(n)) + 1\r\n\r\nwith ib.for_range(0, num_loop, test=(lo[0] < hi[0])) as _:\r\n    mid = lo[0] + tvm.tir.floordiv(hi[0] - lo[0], 2).astype(\"int32\")\r\n    with ib.if_scope(Aptr[mid] < v):\r\n        lo[0] = mid + 1\r\n    with ib.else_scope():\r\n        hi[0] = mid\r\n\r\nCptr[i] = lo[0]\r\n```\r\nMy motivation was to improve GPU NMS performance using while loop, and it indeed did:\r\n\r\nNMS workload from PyTorch MaskRCNN:\r\n```\r\nWithout while loop (current main): 4.11 milli sec\r\nWith while loop (my branch): 3.66 milli sec\r\n```\r\nAnd a crazy 120000 box + 100 `max_out_size` NMS workload from TF MaskRCNN. The difference is huge because the # of iterations changed from 120000 to 100 (roughly)\r\n```\r\nWithout while loop (current main): 51.31 milli sec\r\nWith while loop (my branch): 17.63 milli

discussion in https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/ansor-task-scheduler-spending-too-much-trial-on-dead-end-tasks/8955, this PR improves the early stopping criteria in the task scheduler. Now we have two early stopping factors:\r\n\r\n- `TuningOptions.early_stopping`: Like other options in this object, the `early_stopping` in TuningOptions affects each task.\r\n- `task_scheduler.tune(..., early_stopping=None)`: Since this is only for task_scheduler, this `early_stopping` applies to an entire tuning process.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when setting `TuningOptions.early_stopping`, a task will be stopped early if it has no improvement for N measurements, but the task scheduler will keep tuning rest tasks. On the other hand, `task_scheduler.tune(..., early_stopping)` serves as the original functionality that early stops an entire tuning process after no improvement for N measurements (regardless which tasks).\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy @masahi

recently spent a lot of time fighting dynamic rank issues in a kind of crazy ONNX model. Fixing it required doing incremental dynamic-to-static before type inference. This PR basically changes the logic of dynamic to static from this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninfer type on the whole function\r\nconstant fold the whole function\r\nthen go find dynamic ops who's inputs are constant\r\n    replace them with static ops\r\nRinse and repeat\r\n```\r\n\r\nto this:\r\n```\r\ngo find dynamic ops\r\n    infer type and constant fold their inputs\r\n    If the inputs are now constant, replace them with static ops\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage that it can analyze those crazy dynamic rank and control flow graphs and simplify them, but it has the disadvantage that it's slower than the previous version because we call infertype and constant folding many more times.\r\n\r\nPerformance checking shows that this takes a BERT compile from ~15 seconds to ~60 seconds. This should be fixable when incremental type inference becomes available.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMatthew\r\n\r\ncc @masahi @jroesch @tmoreau89 @jwfromm @electriclilies

tvmc does not allow users to overriding specific shapes (such as batch sizes) and instead uses what is defined within the model file. In most cases this is most practical, but in there are some cases that would benefit from additional flexibility i.e. undefined shape sizes, fiddling with batch sizes. This PR adds support for manually specifying input shapes. :)

@masahi \r\n\r\nI recently ran into a situation where I needed to match based on a function signature, but not necessarily on the function body. To support that, I made some changes to the pattern matcher to allow matching and rewriting functions as long as everything in the match is completely dominated by the pattern.\r\n\r\nThis works for rewriting, but I haven't been able to get the partitioner to work properly on these tests, so I added a unit test but skipped it with a TODO.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys

the loop importer in onnx works for simple cases, it had some issues for loops that output and accumulate tensors. This PR adds handling for both scalar and tensor outputs and corresponding tests. \r\n\r\nNote that one issue encountered was that an injective schedule was applied to concatenate during compilation. Unfortunately, the concat in our loop has dynamic shapes which caused an invalid access in the schedule. This PR also includes a check to make sure that the shapes of concat's inputs are static before trying to vectorize.","created_at":"2021-01-27T22:38:36Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:55:43Z","closed_at":"2021-01-28T04:30:31Z","merged_at":"2021-01-28T04:30:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"913abe087a3054831662b995c2e4f1f2271afbc6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776288,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzYyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20review%20in%20progress","name":"status:

PR adds various updates to the PyTorch frontend, to fully support the recent transformer based object detection model from facebook, DETR https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr. After this PR, DETR runs on TVM and gets the correct results. TVM with auto scheduled GPU conv2d and batched matmul is 1.4x faster than PyTorch in my environment.\r\n\r\nAlso added various missing ops reported by hummingbird projects. @interesaaat\r\n\r\n* Adds support for ops requested by hummingbird project: `logical_and`, `masked_select`, `sort` and `argsort`. `masked_select` requires VM to run.\r\n* Adds support for `cumsum` and `masked_fill` op, to enable importing DETR https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr. `cumsum` is also requested by hummingbird.\r\n* Fix negative indexing using `mode=\"wrap\"` in Relay `take` op. Without this, the result doesn't match with DETR.\r\n* Remove explicit `broadcast_to` before `batch_matmul`. Without it, memory usage blows up during constant evaluation of DETR. This is the same issue as https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6616, please see the explanation there. \r\n* Add ` torch.nn.Transformer` to the tests.\r\n\r\nSince `torch.sort` returns both sorted values and indices while the Relay one doesn't, `torch.sort` conversion is not efficient, ~~especially for multidimensional input (currently does both sort and argsort!). Suggestions for a better implementation are welcome.~~ UPDATE: fixed\r\n\r\nplease review @siju-samuel @jwfromm @kevinthesun @t-vi

PR adds two new graph rewrite to optimize Faster RCNN / MaskRCNN. Happy to split them into two PRs if preferred.\r\n\r\nThe first one is to exploit the fact that in PyTorch detection models, NMS is always followed by post NMS topk, as shown below.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/8ebfd2f5d5f1792ce2cf5a2329320f604530a68e/torchvision/models/detection/rpn.py#L272-L275\r\n\r\nWe can extract that topk parameter and use it as `max_out_size` parameter in our NMS. This brings a good speed up 4.51 milli sec -> 4.11 milli sec, and further speed up is easily expected if we had TIR while loop (cc @tqchen)\r\n\r\nThe second is to replace the repeated scatter loop in\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/6315358dd06e3a2bcbe9c1e8cdaa10898ac2b308/torchvision/ops/poolers.py#L20-L29\r\n\r\nwith something like this:\r\n```\r\nindices_per_level = []\r\nfor level in range(num_scales):\r\n    idx_in_level = torch.where(levels == level)[0]\r\n    indices_per_level.append(idx_in_level)\r\n\r\nstacked_features = torch.cat(roi_align_results, dim=0)\r\nstacked_indices = torch.cat(indices_per_level, dim=0)\r\nargsort_indices = torch.argort(stacked_indices)\r\nreturn stacked_features[argsort_indices, :]\r\n```\r\ni.e., we are able to remove `torch.zeros` (which turns out very expensive, due to too much `any_dim` generated by Relay) and repeated 4D scatters (which is slow because scatters cannot be parallelized well). Instead, we can do concat, argsort, and batched gather to get equivalent result, which is much more efficient. This transformation is not at all obvious, I think this is a great example of the power of graph rewrite. It cuts more than 10 milli seconds from MaskRCNN / FasterRCNN.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I expect this PR is hard to review, let me know if you have any questions. I tried to give detailed comments to aid understanding. \r\n\r\nThis concludes the series of PRs I did to optimize MaskRCNN on GPU + VM, here is the current numbers. Surprisingly, NVPTX generates much better code for the dynamic injective ops, which is one of the bottlenecks in MaskRCNN due to a certain limitation in Relay + TE (too many unnecessary `any_dim` generated). I hope we can discuss this performance result further in the forum.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nTVM result is obtained after auto scheduling. In MaskRCNN, there are some dynamic batch \r\nconv2d and conv2d transpose that cannot be tuned and hence extremely slow. \r\n\r\ncublas is always required to get reasonable result, since there is one big dynamic dense op\r\nthat is extremely slow with the default schedule. \r\n\r\nGTX 1070 ti, on an input (1, 3, 300, 300)\r\n\r\nFaster RCNN\r\nTorch: 0.0738 sec\r\nTVM with cuda target + cublas: 0.0712 sec\r\nTVM with nvptx target + cublas: 0.0708 sec\r\n\r\nMaskRCNN\r\nTorch: 0.115 sec\r\nTVM with cuda target + cublas: 0.166 sec\r\nTVM with nvptx target + cublas: 0.135 sec\r\n```\r\nplease

hardware plarform have multiple types compute chipset like\r\nGPU,FPGA,APU,RPU etc, there is a requirement that use these compute\r\nunit in parallel to reach best performance.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nIn these pipeline solution, we first split the compute graph into\r\na group of subgraph, then run these subgraph in a pipeline module\r\nto make the GPU/FPGA/APU/RPU parallel running become possible.\r\n\r\nthis patch is to address compute graph split issue\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

adds a numpy style cumsum op to Relay/TOPI. The spec is identical with numpy one except there is no promotion of int32 -> int64 output dtype, for the case when the input is a int32 tensor and output dtype is not provided. \r\nhttps://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cumsum.html\r\n\r\nBoth CPU and GPU are supported, and it is especially efficient if thrust is available. I updated TIR scan IR to support cumsum on any rank.

now due to historical reasons we sometimes build the CRT from build/standalone_crt and other times from src/runtime/crt. This PR consolidates building to always be from `build/standalone_crt` and updates several path computations to use that. Ultimately we'll need this if we expect microTVM to be useful when TVM has been `pip install`ed rather than just built from source.\r\n\r\nThis is also helpful for autotuning, as we expect the autotvm runner to use `standalone_crt` to build the project. This PR also changes the default compiler options to reference the standalone_crt directory.\r\n\r\nFinally, to properly separate the host main() and crt_config.h from the remaining reusable CRT libs, places these in a new directory `standalone_crt/template` along with the template crt_config.h.","created_at":"2021-01-23T02:47:58Z","updated_at":"2021-02-12T23:42:08Z","closed_at":"2021-02-12T23:41:34Z","merged_at":"2021-02-12T23:41:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8a83403ddca43b223d4e1cdd482e35b98171171","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

PR fixes error messages that arise when a runtime array does not have the correct element types for a function. For example:\r\n```\r\n# before\r\nCheck failed: ObjectTypeChecker<TObjectRef>::Check(ptr) == false: Expect Array[Operation] but get Array\r\n# after\r\nCheck failed: ObjectTypeChecker<TObjectRef>::Check(ptr) == false: Expect Array[Operation] but get Array[index 0: Tensor]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that because runtime `Array`s are not homogenous, specific elements can fail the type checking. I've added which element fails to the errors message along with its type. This can also happen for `Map`s, but I could not figure out a good way to print which element mismatches (because the elements are unordered and I worry printing the key may take too much space).\r\n\r\nThis is a replacement for #7309 that returns the mismatched type when a runtime object cannot be converted.\r\n\r\n@jroesch @tqchen @junrushao1994

the discussion [here](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/confusing-behavior-with-graph-partitioning/8879), it appears there is a bug with how the annotation pass handles let expressions; in particular the let assignment seems to produce a `compiler_begin` tag without a corresponding `compiler_end` tag. In this PR, I have added a test case that demonstrates this. However, I do not know what the fix should be, if any.\r\n\r\n@zhiics @comaniac, could you examine the behavior in this test case and determine if it is behaving as expected? For the \"expected\" output, I simply copied what the pass was doing, so I do not know what the specification really is (please correct me if it is documented somewhere). If a fix is needed, I would be happy to implement it, but I do not know what the expected annotations should be.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Per the discussion in the TVM Discuss thread, it seems that let nodes are being incorrectly handled.","created_at":"2021-01-20T23:57:03Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T20:09:56Z","closed_at":"2022-01-19T20:09:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d89c764b45c971eb76dd41f0673bb06730ffc2d5","assignee":{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5145158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics","html_url":"https://github.com/zhiics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhiics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776288,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzYyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20review%20in%20progress","name":"status:

this PR, we attempt to enable schedule sharing as a workaround before the dynamic shape support is fully landed. The idea is that if we have a schedule for batch size 1, then it is actually applicable to all other batch sizes (regardless the performance). This is useful when we only tune the workload with batch size 1 but wish to use it for all batch sizes to at least make the flow working.\r\n\r\nTo do so, we introduce \"workload distance factor\", which indicates the similarity of two workloads. Specifically, it is calculated by the following rules:\r\n- If two workloads are not for the same compute DAG or function, then `inf`.\r\n- If two workloads are for the same compute DAG/function, and\r\n    - their non-zero integer arguments are dividable and their zero and non-integer arguments are the same, then `factor=prod(a / b) for a, b in zip(wkl1.args, wkl2.args)`,\r\n    - otherwise `inf`.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the distance factor ranges from 1 to `inf`. When the distance factor is not `inf`, meaning that it is safe to apply the schedule of workload 2 to workload 1.\r\n\r\nThe above mechanism works well for registered TE computes but not the ComputeDAG extracted from Relay programs. This is because currently when extracting tasks from Relay, we use MD5 to hash the ComputeDAG serialized string to be its key, which includes not only the DAG structure but the shapes, so it's impossible to calculate the distance factor. To make it work, this PR also improves the hashing mechanism of ComputeDAG by separating the input/output tensor shapes so that they can be accessed. For example, the workload key of a ComputeDAG was:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\"8d5a93959138dc7b2ee1f1b3219dfa14\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it now becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\"ad6cecbf5d85cb1cda3c2bb7af170211\", 1, 7, 7, 512, 4, 4, 512, 512, 1, 7, 7, 512, 1, 1, 1, 512, 1, 1, 1, 512, 1, 7, 7, 512]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Please note that since we change the workload key format of ComputeDAG, the tuning logs won't match anymore**. To make it work again, we can use the following script to update the keys in existing log files. This is also the way I used to update the CI logs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport json\r\nimport hashlib\r\nimport os\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nfrom tvm.te import ComputeOp, PlaceholderOp\r\n\r\nfrom

PR improves the implementation of GPU `argwhere` added in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6868, using exclusive scan (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7303). \r\n\r\nThe current implementation of `argwhere` is very inefficient, because it uses atomic to update the write location. Since all threads compete for the single location, this effectively makes it a sequential kernel. Moreover, since the output indices need to be lexicographically sorted, the current implementation involves sorting along each axis.\r\n\r\nSince `argwhere` is literally an instance of stream compaction, this is a perfect application of exclusive scan. Now, `argwhere` simply consists of \r\n* A single call to exclusive scan on a boolean flag array to compute the write indices.\r\n* Compaction using the write indices (just copying elements with nonzero condition).\r\n\r\nboth of which are highly parallel operation. Thus, both atomic and sort are gone, vastly simplifying the implementation. Moreover, it also brings huge speed up, as shown below.\r\n\r\nAll numbers in milli sec\r\n| Shape         | current main  | using thrust exclusive scan| using TIR exclusive

added a new function `GetFullType` on all object that prints the type of the object along with the types of objects it contains. I've only updated on assert to use it so far, I'll update the rest in a subsequent PR. Here is an example of how it improves error messages:\r\n```\r\n# before\r\nCheck failed: ObjectTypeChecker<TObjectRef>::Check(ptr) == false: Expect Array[Operation] but get Array\r\n# after\r\nCheck failed: ObjectTypeChecker<TObjectRef>::Check(ptr) == false: Expect Array[Operation] but get Array[Tensor]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that because I've added a virtual function to Object, I'm now seeing all these warnings:\r\n```\r\n../src/runtime/vm/memory_manager.cc: In function ‘void tvm::runtime::vm::BufferDeleter(tvm::runtime::Object*)’:\r\n../src/runtime/vm/memory_manager.cc:42:3: warning: deleting object of polymorphic class type ‘tvm::runtime::NDArray::Container’ which has non-virtual destructor might cause undefined behavior [-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor]\r\n   42 |   delete ptr;\r\n```\r\nI believe this warning is valid, but was not caused by this PR. We have already been calling non-virtual destructors on polymorphic classes. Maybe we should fix this in a separate PR?\r\n\r\n@jroesch @tqchen @junrushao1994 @rkimball

Thrust scan is so fast that other kernels in `get_valid_counts` become bottleneck. That's why there are only 2x difference in `(16, 1000000, 5)` result, for example. \r\n\r\nTo show the utility of `exclusive_scan`, I'll follow up with the following PRs.\r\n* Rewrite CUDA `argwhere` added in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6868 using `exclusive_scan`. This will enable removing atomic and sort, vastly simplifying the implementation. Also the performance of `argwhere` will be completely bounded by the performance of `exclusive_scan` (i.e., it should be much faster than the current implementation).\r\n* Add `cumsum` Relay/TOPI op. As expected, this will simply be a wrapper around `exclusive_scan`.\r\n* Add `unique` Relay/TOPI op. This is sort + adjacent difference + exclusive scan\r\n\r\nFor now, only 1D and 2D inputs are supported, and scan is always done on the inner most axis. The API is preliminary, comments are welcome. On CUDA, thrust scan is always used when available, but it is also possible to use thrust scan only if the target is `cuda -libs=thrust`, for example.\r\n\r\n Actually, something called \"scan\" is [already a thing](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/language/scan.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-language-scan-py) in TVM from the very beginning, but it seems it has some limitations and I don't think people care about it, so I went ahead and added `topi/cuda/scan.py`. An alternative `prefix_sum.py` also seems good to me, if people prefer.\r\n\r\nready for review @mbrookhart @Laurawly @zhiics @trevor-m @anijain2305 @antinucleon

noticed that many of our onnx frontend tests compare to results produced by numpy rather than onnx itself. This is somewhat counterproductive because it makes assumptions about what onnx should do rather than checking what it actually does. I decided to go through all the tests in `test_forward.py` and make them use the new `verify_with_ort` helper function. This makes our testing suite more consistent and align more closely with their intention. In the process of making this conversion, I discovered many bugs with the importer that are also fixed in this PR. Although this PR might be a little painful to review due to its scope, I think that the result is an overall much cleaner and easier to maintain test suite.","created_at":"2021-01-17T00:35:22Z","updated_at":"2021-01-19T19:09:29Z","closed_at":"2021-01-19T14:32:43Z","merged_at":"2021-01-19T14:32:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"f91b51d638874973a2d9ccbcb4d49cf7c668f516","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7300/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7300/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7300/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/553bb56f7286eba5c1cfe6052047fa35748f11f4","head":{"label":"jwfromm:onnx_test_cleanup","ref":"onnx_test_cleanup","sha":"553bb56f7286eba5c1cfe6052047fa35748f11f4","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

PR implements the [Consolidating Python Dependencies RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-consolidating-tvm-python-dependencies/8329). \r\n\r\nAs part of this RFC, we decided to try a solution halfway between burdening TVM with a full-blown dependency tool such as poetry and the approach we currently take (scattered Python deps). The initial patchset here contains the tool plus some examples of the dependencies. The remaining things needed to merge this PR:\r\n- [x] Write tests for the tool\r\n- [x] Finish consolidating various dependencies from the ci docker containers\r\n\r\nI'm posting this now before I do any of the test work to get feedback on the approach now that there's something concrete to look at. I do think this tool is a bit more complex than it could be, and am concerned about maintaining it. In particular the logic needed to lint the dependencies list is complex. I don't see a solution that avoids joining a set of dependencies by feature against a constraints list as very workable given the current extras structure.\r\n\r\nAnother topic for discussion is the use of semver. Python does contain a compatibility operator we could use. We should probably debate between the two (let's use the forum for this), as it would remove some complexity here.\r\n\r\nComments would be quite welcomed!\r\n\r\n@tqchen @tkonolige @mshawcroft

ran into a small issue when constructing a test case involving the `AnnotateTarget` pass and a function returning an empty tuple -- it was inserting a `compiler_end` annotation without a corresponding `compiler_begin` annotation. It turns out there was a check missing from `InsertCompilerEndAndPropogateTarget` (it checks for calls without args but not for empty tuples). This PR inserts a check and adds a test case.\r\n\r\nPlease review @zhiics @comaniac
