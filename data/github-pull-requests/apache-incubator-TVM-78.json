Metal has some limitations on the number of input parameters. More\r\ninformation can be found here:\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/buffers/about_argument_buffers?language=objc\r\n\r\nIn this commit a new pass for splitting functions with big number of\r\narguments to smaller parts was added. In parameter `max_function_args`\r\nwe can specify the maximum number of kernel arguments for specific\r\ntarget and then split kernel when the number of arguments exceeds the\r\nvalue of `max_function_args`. Currently this pass works only for concat\r\nlayer.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!   Please refer to guideline https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/ for useful information and tips.

have been recurring problems of `AlterOpLayout` pass modifying its input module in-place, see for example https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/6624, https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7979.\r\n\r\nThe root cause was the use of `const_cast` used in many of `InferCorrectLayout` functions, followed by in-place modification of attributes to update for the new layouts:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/813136401a11a49d6c15e6013c34dd822a5c4ff6/src/relay/op/nn/upsampling.h#L42-L43\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors layout transform passes so that `const_cast` is no longer required. Each `InferCorrectLayout` function simply creates and returns updated attributes in addition to inferred layouts. The main change is in `src/relay/transforms/transform_layout.h`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/6624, but there are apparently other problems with `AlterOpLayout` not related to in-place modification, so leave https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7979 open for now.\r\n\r\nPlease review @anijain2305 @comaniac @mbrookhart @jwfromm

recently introduced `axes` argument (which if I understand correctly aims to circumvent limitations in the type system for dynamic shape inference), so I just added a check. In my mind, `strided_slice` (as opposed to `dyn.strided_slice`) should be used when everything is concrete, but I think now it allows for limited shape dynamism which atm isn't a good idea for training anyway. cc @masahi for

is split into two commits, one which implements the fix, and one which refactors the result into a more general use.\r\n\r\n* [Vulkan][Codegen] Fixed SPIR-V scoping bug with threadIdx\r\n\r\n  Unlike in Cuda, where the threadIdx.x/y/z are separate built-in variables, in vulkan the built-in thread index consists of an array\r\nthat must be dereferenced.  If `te.thread_axis(\"threadIdx.x\")` is first declared inside a scope, then that same python object is passed as the IterVar of a separate scope, this breaks the spirv scoping rules, and may result in an undefined variable.  This only applies to threadIdx/blockIdx variables, as all other variable declarations obey tir's scoping rules.\r\n\r\n  To resolve, the threadIdx and blockIdx variables are declared at the top of the function declaration.  This makes the generated spirv code follow the same semantics as tir/cuda.\r\n\r\n* [Vulkan][Codegen] Refactor of GetLocalID and GetWorkgroupID\r\n\r\n  Shared behavior separated out into

introduces structures generated to provide a documented and stable user\r\nfriendly interface to a TVM generated model, as can be seen in the AOT\r\ndemo application:\r\n```\r\nstruct tvmgen_default_inputs inputs = {\r\n  .input_1 = input_data,\r\n};\r\nstruct tvmgen_default_outputs outputs = {\r\n  .output = output_data,\r\n};\r\nint ret_val = tvmgen_default_run(&inputs, &outputs, NULL, NULL);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis relies on a generated header `tvmgen_default.h` placed in the Model Library Format archive, see example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*!\r\n * \\brief input tensors for TVM module \"default\" \r\n */\r\nstruct tvmgen_default_inputs {\r\n  void* x;\r\n  void* y;\r\n  void* z;\r\n};\r\n\r\n/*!\r\n * \\brief output tensors for TVM module \"default\" \r\n */\r\nstruct tvmgen_default_outputs {\r\n  void* output;\r\n};\r\n\r\n/*!\r\n * \\brief entrypoint function for TVM module \"default\"\r\n * \\param inputs Input tensors for the module \r\n * \\param outputs Output tensors for the module \r\n */\r\nint32_t tvmgen_default_run(\r\n  struct tvmgen_default_inputs* inputs,\r\n  struct tvmgen_default_outputs* outputs\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this, some other changes are included:\r\n* Removed dependency on `aot_executor.{c,h}` in tests, pending the\r\ndiscussion in the [C interface RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-utvm-embedded-c-runtime-interface/9951) as to whether we keep them.\r\n* Moved creation of test DLTensor's into the AOT test utils, in future this\r\ncan be replaced by loading via the Python API or otherwise\r\n* Introduce `parametrize_aot_options` which can be used to test\r\npermutations of AOT which work together - for now this filters C\r\ninterface and packed operators\r\n* Updated demo application to generate the header for demonstration\r\npurposes, we should consider porting the demo application to Model\r\nLibrary Format and using the toolchain in the Zephyr App via CMake\r\ninstead?\r\n\r\nThis patch builds upon the improvements @giuseros made to AOT testing\r\nand will greatly benefit from name mangling from #8014\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-18T14:24:20Z","updated_at":"2021-08-16T15:50:50Z","closed_at":"2021-08-02T23:04:56Z","merged_at":"2021-08-02T23:04:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"49d5879e1b35444562402aab4dfc2c1efa1d8098","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"wweic","id":594848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic","html_url":"https://github.com/wweic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wweic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url

Any CUDA-related calls after that will trigger errors.\r\n\r\nFor example, in PyTorch `cudnnDestroy` is disabled b.c.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>details</summary><p>\r\n\r\n(\\cite: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/c371542efc31b1abfe6f388042aa3ab0cef935f2/aten/src/ATen/cudnn/Handle.cpp#L12)\r\n```C++\r\n// this is because of something dumb in the ordering of\r\n// destruction. Sometimes atexit, the cuda context (or something)\r\n// would already be destroyed by the time this gets destroyed. It\r\n// happens in fbcode setting. @colesbury and I decided to not destroy\r\n// the handle as a workaround.\r\n//   - @soumith\r\n//\r\n// Further note: this is now disabled globally, because we are seeing\r\n// the same issue as mentioned above in CUDA 11 CI.\r\n//   - @zasdfgbnm\r\n//\r\n// #ifdef NO_CUDNN_DESTROY_HANDLE\r\n// #else\r\n//   cudnnDestroy(handle);\r\n// #endif\r\n```\r\n</p></details>\r\n\r\n## How to Fix\r\n\r\n### How PyTorch fixes this\r\n\r\nLet's first see how PyTorch handles this problem [link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/c371542efc31b1abfe6f388042aa3ab0cef935f2/aten/src/ATen/cudnn/Handle.cpp#L12).\r\n\r\nIn a word, PyTorch does not call any `cudnnDestroy` and they maintain a CuDNN handler pool to do the job (see [this](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/c371542efc31b1abfe6f388042aa3ab0cef935f2/aten/src/ATen/cudnn/Handle.cpp#L43)).\r\n\r\nBecause they leverage a global pool and constantly reuse them and the pool's lifetime goes across the program, there's no need to call `cudnnDestroy` when the program is about to exit.\r\n\r\n###  This PR's quick workaround\r\n\r\nThe key is to tell \"is the program about to exit\"? If so, we do not have to call `cudnnDestroy`, which avoids such failure on some platforms.\r\n\r\nTo know whether the program is exiting, we can register an `atexit` function in the constructor (later registered function executes first, so this call is ahead of cuda context exit call) to set `cudnn_context_must_exist` to `false`.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-16T19:27:25Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T05:58:49Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T00:47:20Z","merged_at":"2021-06-30T00:47:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"c8f54f9285168d7a72a198f2c96fffe61ed5bcf9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8267/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8267/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8267/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/55b0cf39ac400a31c372d208777ca44c2e88d7be","head":{"label":"ganler:fix-cudnn-context","ref":"fix-cudnn-context","sha":"55b0cf39ac400a31c372d208777ca44c2e88d7be","user":{"login":"ganler","id":38074777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDc0Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38074777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler","html_url":"https://github.com/ganler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":354541417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ1NDE0MTc=","name":"tvm","full_name":"ganler/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ganler","id":38074777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDc0Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38074777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler","html_url":"https://github.com/ganler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ganler/tvm","description":"Open

implementation of `batch_matmul` in TF frontend is not able to handle cases where the shape of the second input differs from the first and a broadcast is needed to complete the operation. Also, in the current logic it always assumed that the shape of second input `shape_y` is atleast of length 3. This is not the case is some TF2 models like [efficientdet](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientdet/d0/1). This PR handles these use cases. \r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

interrupted tuning session, we may face the problem that the\r\nstream object was released, but we didn't create a new one. In this case\r\nit wasn't possible to run a new Metal task on the device without\r\nrestarting rpc application.\r\n\r\nCreated a global function `metal.ResetGlobalState` which should be\r\ncalled in RPC application when the connection was closed. In this\r\nfunction, we reinitialize the streams of Metal devices. And it\r\nguarantees to us that the new RPC session will work with the correct\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nAlso refactored code of metal_device_api:\r\n- Rename function GetStream -> CastStreamOrGetCurrent\r\n- Add several checks on device id\r\n- When we use `SetStream` with nullptr, then the default stream will be\r\n  associated with the device.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

is a bug mentioned in [8319](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/error-when-quantizing-mobilenetv2-model-from-mxnet/8319) and [6346](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/quantization-mobilenetv2-quantization-failed/6346).\r\n\r\nFor MobileNetV2, there will be a layer of conv2d after global_avg_pool2d. But for the current quantization strategy, stop_quantize() will be called as soon as global_avg_pool2d is encountered:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/d69011dea6a09960b38d36f679888a6e29c24240/python/tvm/relay/quantize/_annotate.py#L395-L410\r\n\r\nIn the process of Realize, the conv2d which behind global_avg_pool2d will still enter the Conv2dRealize function. This will cause the quantization of MobileNetV2 to fail:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/d69011dea6a09960b38d36f679888a6e29c24240/src/relay/quantize/realize.cc#L206-L215\r\n\r\nWhen using skip_conv_layers in the other layers other than layer 0, we will also encounter the same bug.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple modification with reference to MulRealize and AddRealize. Then all the networks in [quantization](https://github.com/apache/tvm/tree/main/tests/python/nightly/quantization) can run without error at present. But the accuracy of the network in [test_quantization_accuracy.py](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/tests/python/nightly/quantization/test_quantization_accuracy.py) is currently unable to achieve the previous results, and because there is no AutoTVM log, they are now running very slowly.\r\n\r\nCould you help review this pr? @masahi @ZihengJiang @tqchen

`nn.dense` op and `nn.batch_matmul` op may have bad performance in some model whose weight is not a const parameters. We have some discussion in https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/discussion-about-the-weight-layout-of-dense-batchmatmul/10171\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Add an extra `nn.matmul` op that supports data tensor and weight tensor to be transposed or non-transposed format\r\n- Make the `nn.dense` as an alias of `nn.matmul` when data tensor is non-transposed and weight tensor is transposed\r\n- Add an extra option for tensorflow frontend that we can choose to use `nn.dense` or `nn.matmul`.\r\n\r\nSince currently we only have complete schedule support for `nn.dense`, the `nn.dense` approach is still used by default in different frontends.\r\n\r\nWill later add full transpose support for `nn.batch_matmul` in another PR.\r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @tqchen @FrozenGene @junrushao1994 @altanh
