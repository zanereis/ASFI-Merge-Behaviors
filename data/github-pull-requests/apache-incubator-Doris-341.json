Proposed changes\r\n\r\nRelated to PR #7459.\r\n\r\nImplement `iot_first` and `iot_last` functions.\r\nThese are two aggregate functions that are used to implement semantics similar to the\r\n`first` and `last` functions in [influxdb](https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.x/stdlib/universe/first/).\r\n\r\nExamples can be found in `iot_first.md` and `iot_last.md`\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-03T16:03:32Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T00:11:07Z","closed_at":"2022-07-24T00:11:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10d7ea180d2dc6976fefe4caf80d040ae5988b07","assignee":{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2040870921,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQwODcwOTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/sql/function","name":"area/sql/function","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n1. Consider the responsibility of Reader,  Rename Reader to TabletReader, I think the new name TabletReader can represent its function exactly,  it is more suitable and meaningful\r\n2. add virtual keyword for the destructor of OlapScanner, because VOlapScanner is derived from it\r\n3. refactor struct ReaderParams and KeysParam as TabletReader's inner struct，guard by TabletReader name scope, it's also more reasonable\r\n4. reduce OlapScanner's member data amount, just use _parent->member_data is simpler\r\n5. bugfix: TupleReader has the same memeber data _collect_iter to its parent class Reader, this usage is dangerous, the writer may make some mistake, so i delete TupleReader::_collect_iter to fix it.\r\n6. call set_tablet_reader() in OlapScanner::prepare() to setup _tablet_reader, VOlapScanner should override set_tablet_reader to new BlockReader instead,  use this way to avoid new Reader twice by reset unique_ptr _tablet_reader\r\n7. if the member data is a inseparable part of a class, i suggest using normal variable while not pointer variable, because pointer bring a indirect lay and must handle coping and destructing carefully, it's not necessary\r\n8. some other small changes for readbility or design\r\n\r\nClose related #issue (replace it with issue number if it exists).\r\n\r\nDescribe the overview of changes, and introduce why we need it.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. When the hot data need to be changed to cold data, MigrationHandler will create a new Job of SchemaChangeV2, call the CreateReplicaTask and AlterReplicaTask. It will do something:\r\n    1.1 FE create a new shadow tablet with remote path, send this request to BE.(MigrationHandler.java)\r\n    1.2 BE will create local cache dir for remote path, upload data from local to s3. (schema_change.cpp  beta_rowset.cpp)\r\n    1.3 Write tablet_uid(used for remote path) in cache path.  (schema_change.cpp) tablet_uid will be used to create the remote path on S3. When the remote path need to be deleted, tablet_uid is useful.\r\n    1.4 update meta to olap meta.  (schema_change.cpp)\r\n2. hot data to cold data, for FE:\r\n    2.1 Add StorageColdMedium for DataProperty. change every DataProperty() function.\r\n    2.2 Add Type S3 to Cold Storage. (PropertyAnalyzer.java)\r\n3. Whe the cold data need to be read:\r\n    3.1 RemoteBlockManager will be used, all the operations will be done in it.\r\n    3.2 When a select operation arrived, it will be send to RemoteBlockManager, download the files from remote path on S3 to cache path, read the files in cache path and return.\r\n5. When the cold data need to be dropped:\r\n    3.1 move remote data to trash path on s3.（data_dir.cpp  move_to_trash()）\r\n    3.2 move local data to trash path on local disk.\r\n    3.3 delete files in trash dir on remote and local.（storage_engine.cpp start_trash_sweep()   _do_sweep())\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSupport UDF is implemented through GRPC protocol. This brings several benefits:\r\n\r\n1.  The udf implementation language is not limited to c++, users can use any familiar language to implement udf\r\n2. UDF is decoupled from Doris, udf will not be doris coredump together, udf computing resources are separated from doris, and doris services are not affected\r\n\r\nBut RPC's UDF has a fixed overhead, so its performance is much slower than C++ UDF, especially when the amount of data is large.\r\n\r\nCreate function like\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE FUNCTION rpc_add(INT, INT) RETURNS INT PROPERTIES (\r\n  \"SYMBOL\"=\"add_int\",\r\n  \"OBJECT_FILE\"=\"127.0.0.1:9999\",\r\n  \"TYPE\"=\"RPC\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nfunction service need to implements `check_fn` and `fn_call` methods\r\n#7502 #7578 \r\n\r\nthe rpc udf call is  a little slower than  the native function call in vectorized mode:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9098473/151144722-64057741-07fa-4406-9a83-839827dbf65c.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9098473/151144755-d0d9b2bb-042a-40aa-b127-79464dd0e4ec.png)\r\nBut it will much slow in non-vectorized mode, and if using  rpc udf  in vectorized mode the query time is equal to native function call in non-vectorized mode\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9098473/151145682-e5465fce-30a8-40ba-85d7-9b90f4d23f2e.png)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nfix #7478 \r\n\r\nConstant folding is achieved by simulating the computation process of expr tree in BE. So the expr must be analyzed, otherwise there is an error in the conversion to thrift structure.\r\n\r\nThe having clause records the result of analyze in `havingClauseAfterAnaylzed` during the process of analyze, so there is an error when converting to thrift structure using `havingClause`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.
