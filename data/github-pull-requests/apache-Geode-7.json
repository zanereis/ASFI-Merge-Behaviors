1\n\nIn `ClientUserAuthsTest`, the `before()` method uses the `spy()`\nmechanism to override `getNextId()` on the `ClientUserAuths` instance it\nis testing. This bypasses the actual implementation for all tests,\nleaving the following important `ClientUserAuths` responsibilities\nuntested:\n- Detect when all IDs have all been used.\n- Clear all existing authorizations when all IDs have been used, to\n  force reauthentication.\n- Re-seed the ID generator when all IDs have been used.\n\nThe tests are likely doing this because `getNextId()` relies on a\n`Random`, which is uncontrollable by design. Because `ClientUserAuths`\ncreates the `Random`, the tests are unable to inject a testable\ninstance, and so instead must bypass the `ClientUserAuths` methods that\ninteract with the `Random`.\n\nPROBLEM 2\n\nSome tests attempt to verify `ClientUserAuths` responsibilities only by\nobserving how a `ClientUserAuths` interacts with itself. These tests\nverify only implementation details, and leave the actual responsibility\nuntested.\n\nPROBLEM 3\n\nIf the `id` passed to `ClientUserAuths.putSubject(subject, id)` is 0 or\n-1, the method treats that as a request to to generate and assign an ID.\nThe `getNextID()` method can return either of these special values, and\nso `putSubject()` might associate the subject with one of them. If a\ncaller later attempts to replace that subject by calling\n`putSubject(replacement, id)` with the same ID (0 or -1), `putSubject()`\nwill generate a new ID and assign it to the replacement, rather than\nreplacing the original subject.\n\nSOLUTIONS\n\n1. Extract and test a `RandomSubjectIdGenerator` that generates random\n   IDs.\n2. Change existing tests so that they do not override production\n   behavior, and so that they verify actual responsibilities.\n3.

5 test classes need not be public. Indeed, IntelliJ's default\ninspections discourage making JUnit 5 classes public.\n\n`StressTestHelper` uses a `ClassGraph` to gather information about test\nclasses. By default, the `ClassGraph` scans only public classes. So by\ndefault, the `ClassGraph` does not gather information about JUnit 5\nclasses with non-public visibility.\n\nAs a result, our stress test scripts do not run JUnit 5 tests.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nCall

repeat test tasks merge the output from all executions of a given\ntest class, making it very difficult to diagnose failures in repeat\ntests.\n\nCAUSE\n\nIn order to run tests repeatedly, our repeat test tasks override Gradle\ncode to allow a test class to execute more than once. Gradle's test\nreporting code does not expect this. It directs the output from each\ntest to a log associated with the test class name, not with the specific\nexecution of the test class. This results in merging the outputs from\ndifferent executions of the same class.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nChange Gradle to distinguish separate executions of a test class, and to\nlog the output from each execution separately.\n\nComponents:\n- New `ExecutionTrackingTestResultProcessor` class: Wraps a given test\n  result processor to append an execution identifier (a simple counter)\n  to the name of the test class when reporting results. Gradle\n  associates the output with this execution-specific name instead of\n  with the class name.\n- New `ExecutionTrackingTestClassProcessor` class: Wraps a given test\n  class processor to report via an\n  `ExecutionTrackingTestResultProcessor`.\n- Change `RepeatTestExecuter` to use an\n  `ExecutionTrackingTestClassProcessor`.\n\nThis commit also reverts GEODE-9912, which partially addressed the same\nproblem by adding an execution ID to each log line from a DUnit ChildVM.\nThe execution ID made it possible to identify the source of each merged\nlog line.

repeat test tasks merge the output from all executions of a given\ntest class, making it very difficult to diagnose failures in repeat\ntests.\n\nCAUSE\n\nIn order to run tests repeatedly, our repeat test tasks override Gradle\ncode to allow a test class to execute more than once. Gradle's test\nreporting code does not expect this. It directs the output from each\ntest to a log associated with the test class name, not with the specific\nexecution of the test class. This results in merging the outputs from\ndifferent executions of the same class.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nChange Gradle to distinguish separate executions of a test class, and to\nlog the output from each execution separately.\n\nComponents:\n- New `InstanceNamingTestResultProcessor` class: Wraps a given test\n  result processor to append an instance identifier (a simple counter)\n  to the name of the test class when reporting results. Gradle\n  associates the output with this instance-specific name instead of with\n  class name.\n- New `InstanceNamingForkingTestClassProcessor` class: Wraps a\n  `ForkingTestClassProcessor` to report via an\n  `InstanceNamingTestResultProcessor`.\n- Change `RepeatTestExecuter` to use an\n  `InstanceNamingForkingTestClassProcessor`.\n\nThis commit also reverts GEODE-9912, which partially addressed the same\nproblem by adding an execution ID to each log line from a DUnit ChildVM.\nThe execution ID made it possible to identify the source of each merged\nlog line. GEODE-9924 (this commit) makes the changes from GEODE-9912\nunnecessary.\n\nNOTES\n- Gradle now creates distinct XML and HTML report files for each\n  execution of a given test class.\n- The test summary HTML page created by Gradle lists each test class\n  execution separately. If a class named `FooTest` executes 50 times (as\n  in a stress test run), the summary will list `FooTest-01`,\n  `FooTest-02`, ..., `FooTest-50` as if they were separate test classes.\n","created_at":"2022-01-07T01:26:40Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T01:28:43Z","closed_at":"2022-01-07T01:28:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d03c665fecb4f3321fa1bc2fdfefc8276769fcdf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mhansonp","id":26558973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU4OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26558973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp","html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/7245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/7245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/6bc35f54f25d5887213f4b5aa62ba2bce595c3ac","head":{"label":"demery-pivotal:geode-9924/avoid-merging-repeat-test-logs","ref":"geode-9924/avoid-merging-repeat-test-logs","sha":"6bc35f54f25d5887213f4b5aa62ba2bce595c3ac","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159222461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkyMjI0NjE=","name":"geode","full_name":"demery-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"no

OpLog files are compacted, but the .drf file is left because it contains deletes of\r\nentries in previous .crfs. The .crf file is deleted, but the orphaned .drf is not until all\r\nprevious .crf files (.crfs with smaller id) are deleted.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that compacted Oplog object representing orphaned .drf file holds\r\na structure in memory (Oplog.regionMap) that contains information that is not useful\r\nafter the compaction and it takes certain amount of memory. Besides, there is a special\r\ncase when creating .krf files that, depending on the execution order,\r\ncould make the problem more severe (it could leave pendingKrfTags structure\r\non the regionMap and this could take up a significant amount of memory). This\r\npendingKrfTags HashMap is actually empty, but consumes memory because it was used\r\npreviously and the size of the HashMap was not reduced after it is cleared.\r\nThis special case usually happens when new Oplog is rolled out and previous Oplog\r\nis immediately marked as eligible for compaction. Compaction and .krf creation start at\r\nthe similar time and compactor cancels creation of .krf file.\r\nThe pendingKrfTags structure is usually cleared when .krf file is created, but since\r\ncompaction canceled creation of .krf, the pendingKrfTags structure remain in memory\r\nuntil Oplog representing orphaned .drf file is deleted.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nClear the regionMap data structure of the Oplog when it is compacted (currently it is\r\ndeleted when the Oplog is destroyed).\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Alberto Gomez <alberto.gomez@est.tech>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is currently designed only to support\r\nsetting a filter on an ObjectOutputStream.\r\n\r\nJava's ObjectInputFilter provides an API for:\r\n1. creating an ObjectInputFilter\r\n2. setting an ObjectInputFilter on an ObjectInputStream\r\n3. setting a process-wide ObjectInputFilter\r\n4. getting an ObjectInputFilter from a ObjectInputStream\r\n5. getting a process-wide ObjectInputFilter\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the package and API structure of ObjectInputFilter\r\nchanged between Java 8 and Java 9. \r\n\r\nObjectInputStreamFilterWrapper encapsulates both Java 8 and \r\nJava 9 using reflection but is designed just for use cases [1]-[2].\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\n\r\nExpand ObjectInputStreamFilterWrapper to be an internal API. Define\r\ninterfaces in the API to help make it more consistent and expressive\r\nwhile at the same time more encapsulated and testable.\r\n\r\nThe previous commit that enabled global serial filtering on the\r\nLocator in Java 8 was reverted due to usability issues in configuring\r\ndeployed jars and user callback classes. This PR also introduces a\r\nnew system property for enabling global serial filtering.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nThe API uses interfaces to improve the overall design and maintain\r\nbetter consistency within the API. Please do not assume that using an\r\ninterface means that there will be more than one implementation.\r\n\r\nThe API defines the following primary interface types:\r\n* factory interfaces for creating instances of various types\r\n* filter interfaces to split out single ops from Java's ObjectInputFilter\r\n* configuration interfaces for handling system properties, logging,\r\n  and config validation\r\n\r\nThe concrete classes in the API receive parameters injected via a\r\nconstructor for any collaborators that are not specified by the\r\ninterfaces. This is intentional even when the instance is only used\r\nonce before de-referencing it. All collaborators that are defined in\r\nthe interface are passed in as parameters to the implementing method;\r\nall others are passed in via the constructor and stored as fields.","created_at":"2021-12-21T00:44:24Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T19:01:25Z","closed_at":"2022-01-18T19:01:25Z","merged_at":"2022-01-18T19:01:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"7978abf34707d11da45cff0b7cb7445f18d21438","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"echobravopapa","id":18683012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjgzMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18683012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa","html_url":"https://github.com/echobravopapa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echobravopapa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kamilla1201","id":6271754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzE3NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6271754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201","html_url":"https://github.com/kamilla1201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nabarunnag","id":8689859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODk4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8689859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag","html_url":"https://github.com/nabarunnag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nabarunnag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/7217/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/7217/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7217/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/a19542b95c2350daaa2e9f3b97b2a03b6718b56e","head":{"label":"kirklund:GEODE-9758-serialization-filter-java8-new-01","ref":"GEODE-9758-serialization-filter-java8-new-01","sha":"a19542b95c2350daaa2e9f3b97b2a03b6718b56e","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58218609,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODIxODYwOQ==","name":"geode","full_name":"kirklund/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzM

1\n\nIn `ClientUserAuthsTest`, the `before()` method uses the `spy()`\nmechanism to override `getNextId()` on the `ClientUserAuths` instance it\nis testing. This bypasses the actual implementation for all tests,\nleaving the following important `ClientUserAuths` responsibilities\nuntested:\n- Detect when all IDs have all been used.\n- Clear all existing authorizations when all IDs have been used, to\n  force reauthentication.\n- Re-seed the ID generator when all IDs have been used.\n\nThe tests are likely doing this because `getNextId()` relies on a\n`Random`, which is uncontrollable by design. Because `ClientUserAuths`\ncreates the `Random`, the tests are unable to inject a testable\ninstance, and so instead must bypass the `ClientUserAuths` methods that\ninteract with the `Random`.\n\nPROBLEM 2\n\nSome tests attempt to verify `ClientUserAuths` responsibilities only by\nobserving how a `ClientUserAuths` interacts with itself. These tests\nverify only implementation details, and leave the actual responsibility\nuntested.\n\nPROBLEM 3\n\nIf the `id` passed to `ClientUserAuths.putSubject(subject, id)` is 0 or\n-1, the method treats that as a request to to generate and assign an ID.\nThe `getNextID()` method can return either of these special values, and\nso `putSubject()` might associate the subject with one of them. If a\ncaller later attempts to replace that subject by calling\n`putSubject(replacement, id)` with the same ID (0 or -1), `putSubject()`\nwill generate a new ID and assign it to the replacement, rather than\nreplacing the original subject.\n\nSOLUTIONS\n\n1. Extract and test a `RandomSubjectIdGenerator` that generates random\n   IDs.\n2. Change existing tests so that they do not override production\n   behavior, and so that they verify actual responsibilities.\n3. Update `getNextID()` to avoid returning 0 or -1.\n\nA subsequent PR can add tests for the now-testable responsibilities.\n","created_at":"2021-12-17T20:18:45Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T23:35:51Z","closed_at":"2022-01-12T23:35:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a566a5749c1734375abb4fd55831f6bfac14b9c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/7210/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/7210/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7210/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/0b1bfcfb43eae8ecbf6a7c7a38fdc24832f678a9","head":{"label":"demery-pivotal:geode-9897/client-auths-tests","ref":"geode-9897/client-auths-tests","sha":"0b1bfcfb43eae8ecbf6a7c7a38fdc24832f678a9","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159222461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkyMjI0NjE=","name":"geode","full_name":"demery-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

1\r\n\r\nIn `ClientUserAuthsTest`, the `before()` method uses the `spy()`\r\nmechanism to override `getNextId()` on the `ClientUserAuths` instance it\r\nis testing. This bypasses the actual implementation for all tests,\r\nleaving the following important `ClientUserAuths` responsibilities\r\nuntested:\r\n- Detect when all IDs have all been used.\r\n- Clear all existing authorizations when all IDs have been used, to\r\n  force reauthentication.\r\n- Re-seed the ID generator when all IDs have been used.\r\n\r\nThe tests are likely doing this because `getNextId()` relies on a\r\n`Random`, which is uncontrollable by design. Because `ClientUserAuths`\r\ncreates the `Random`, the tests are unable to inject a testable\r\ninstance, and so instead must bypass the `ClientUserAuths` methods that\r\ninteract with the `Random`.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM 2\r\n\r\nSome tests attempt to verify `ClientUserAuths` responsibilities only by\r\nobserving how a `ClientUserAuths` interacts with itself. These tests\r\nverify only implementation details, and leave the actual responsibility\r\nuntested.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM 3\r\n\r\n`ClientUserAuths.putSubject(subject, id)` treats `id == 0` as a request\r\nto generate and assign an ID. The `getNextID()` method can generate ID\r\n0, and so `putSubject()` might associate the subject with ID 0. If a\r\ncaller later attempts to replace the subject by calling\r\n`putSubject(replacement, 0)`, `putSubject()` will generate a new ID and\r\nassign it to the replacement, rather than replacing the original\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION\r\n\r\n1. (The first commit in this PR.) Extract and test a `RandomSubjectIdGenerator` that generates random IDs.\r\n2. (The second commit in this PR.)

it works before changes:**\r\nWhen creating an index on the partitioned region, the create index is sent to all members to create an index on all buckets. \r\nAfter that, it checks on all members if there is already an index created or the creation is in progress. \r\nIn case it is already created it will respond with returning index in case the request is remotely originated. In case the request is locally it will throw exception IndexNameConflictException.\r\nIn case it is not already created, it checks if it has FutureTask, which means that index creation is in progress. If there is no FutureTask for this indexTask it will create it locally and send it to all members and wait for their response.\r\nIn case the index creation is in progress on some of the threads, it will wait until it is initialized from that thread. If the request was remotely originated it will return ind to the server from which the request comes to know that it is created on that server.\r\nIn case the request is local, it will also wait until the index creation is finished by some thread which already started creation, before this request comes, and throw IndexNameConflictException as it is already created.\r\nIn that case, the command is not successful and the cluster config is not updated.\r\n\r\n**How it works after changes:**\r\nIt will ignore these exceptions as the index is always created by local or remote requests.\r\nBut another problem happened if we run again the same command, it will print that index is successfully created, but it will not do anything, as there is already an index created with that name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

deadlock happens when server is shutdown gracefully.\r\n\"Distributed system shutdown hook\" thread initiates shutdown threads\r\n\"ConcurrentParallelGatewaySenderEventProcessor Stopper Thread\"\r\nand waits for them to finish.\r\nEvery \"ConcurrentParallelGatewaySenderEventProcessor Stopper Thread\"\r\nthen set flag AckReaderThread.shutdown indicating that AckReaderThread\r\nshould be also shutdown and waits for it by joining the threads for max 15 seconds.\r\nThe \"AckReaderThread for : Event Processor for GatewaySender_sender\"\r\nthread blocks during shutdown because it tries to acquire the lock that was\r\nalready acquired by \"Distributed system shutdown hook\" thread.\r\nThis deadlock only last for 15 seconds, because thread join\r\nwill expire for all  \"ConcurrentParallelGatewaySenderEventProcessor\r\n Stopper Thread\" threads forcing them to finish. Because these threads finished,\r\nthe \"Distributed system shutdown hook\" can continue the execution,\r\nrelease the lock and conclude the shutdown. The problem here is that \r\ndelay of 15 seconds can cause traffic loss if read-timeout on clients\r\nis configured to lower value.\r\n\r\nThe fix:\r\nWhen exception happen in AckReaderThread due to shutdown of the server\r\n(e.g. CacheClosedException) then check if shutdown is already ongoing before\r\ntrying to acquire the lock and initiate shutdown of the dispatcher threads.\r\nWhen server is shutting down that means that dispatcher threads are already\r\nin the process of shutting down and there is no need for AckReaderThread \r\nto initiate the same thing again.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

that are recovered after Region.close() will never be marked as\r\neligible for compaction. This is because unrecoveredRegionCount \r\nis not cleared from Oplog during recovery of the region. When DiskRegion with\r\nAbstractDiskRegionInfo.unrecovered flag is recovered, then unrecoveredRegionCount\r\nshould be decreased for the Oplog (check checkForRecoverableRegion function).\r\nProblem here is that AbstractDiskRegionInfo objects are deleted in \r\nRegion.close(DiskRegion) and then recreated during recovery with flag \r\nAbstractDiskRegionInfo.unrecovered set to false. Due to this unrecoveredRegionCount\r\nfor the Oplog is not decreased during the recovery. This issue doesn't happen when\r\ncache/server is restarted because in that case unrecoveredRegionCount will be cleared.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nDuring close() create and mark AbstractDiskRegionInfo object as unrecovered in all Oplog's\r\nthat are not yet compacted. This way flag AbstractDiskRegionInfo.unrecovered will be read\r\nduring the recovery and unrecoveredRegionCount will be decreased.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This fix also addresses GEODE-9428 where CLUSTERDOWN is occasionally\r\n  reported.\r\n- The NativeRedisClusterTestRule now checks each node to make sure they\r\n  are all reporting the correct node count instead of just one. Nodes\r\n  are not always all ready at once.\r\n- When processing CLUSTER INFO sometimes a 'master' reports with no\r\n  slots which indicates it is transitioning or will become a replica.\r\n  Originally we would mark such a node as a replica even before it had\r\n  fully transitioned.
