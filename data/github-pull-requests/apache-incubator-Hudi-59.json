*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nNow, HoodieFlinkStreamer utility only support one backend - FsStateBackend.\r\n\r\nI think it's not flexible for the application configuration. Could we make backend configurable?\r\n\r\nMoreover, for flink version 1.14, FsStateBackend is deprecated in favor of org.apache.flink.runtime.state.hashmap.HashMapStateBackend and org.apache.flink.runtime.state.storage.FileSystemCheckpointStorage.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n`TypedProperties#keys` is not thread-safe. It was added in #4712 to ensure insertion order of properties is maintained. It was done in order to add a table checksum config in the end which would be used to validate that `hoodie.properties` is not written partially. However, TypedProperties not being thread-safe could result in ConcurrentModificationException as there are places in clustering where write config is passed to spark executor and it might happen that while one thread is trying to serialize it the other is trying to modify it. However, the solution to original problem need not depend on ordering. We can just add table checksum in the end and then while reading `hoodie.properties` just ensure that prop exists.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove `TypedProperties#keys`\r\n- Convert props to linked hashmap and then add table checksum config and then flush it to `hoodie.properties`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades HBase version from 1.2.3 to 2.4.9, addresses issues of Hudi HFile usage due to HBase API changes, and shade HBase-related dependencies in Hudi bundles.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Upgrades HBase version from 1.2.3 to 2.4.9 and Hadoop from 2.7.3 to 2.10.1, which is the minimum Hadoop version required based on HBase documentation.  HBase 2.x is not compatible with Hadoop 2.7 due to usage of hew Hadoop APIs from 2.8.\r\n- Extends `HoodieHBaseKVComparator` from `CellComparatorImpl` which is a `CellComparator` implementation, instead of `KeyValue.KVComparator` since it is deprecated in 2.x.\r\n- Changes HFile reader and writer factory methods and how CellComparator is configured.\r\n  - Adds `HoodieHFileUtils` to construct `HFile.Reader` in different ways.\r\n  - For `HoodieHFileReader` constructor with byte array, the file system and dummy path are passed in.  The dummy path can be either the log file path or base path of the table, which is not actually used for reading content, only serving the purpose of reference.\r\n- Addresses HBase 2.x conflict with HBase 1.x in Hive 2:  In Hudi, we newly include `hudi-common/src/main/resources/hbase-site.xml` containing HBase default configs from the `hbase-common 2.4.9` we use, to override the default configs loaded from `hbase-default.xml` from an older HBase version on the classpath and to ensure correct default configs for Hudi HBase usage.  In Hive, the Hive server loads all lib jars including HBase jars with its corresponding `hbase-default.xml` into class path (e.g., HBase 1.1.1), and that can cause conflict with the `hbase-default.xml` in Hudi bundles (HBase 2.4.9).  The exception is thrown as follows: `Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: hbase-default.xml file seems to be for an older version of HBase (1.1.1), this version is 2.4.9`.  Relevant logic causing such exception can be found in HBaseConfiguration::addHbaseResources().  To get around this issue, since HBase loads `hbase-site.xml` after `hbase-default.xml`, we provide hbase-site.xml from the bundle so that HBaseConfiguration can pick it up and ensure the right defaults.\r\n- Makes changes to configuration in `maven-shade-plugin` for packaging hudi bundles\r\n  - Adds necessary `include`s for HBase 2.x related dependencies\r\n  - Adds ServicesResourceTransformer for shading services resource\r\n  - Adds `relocation` for `org.apache.commons.io.`, `org.apache.hadoop.hbase.`, `org.apache.hbase.`, and `org.apache.htrace.`\r\n  - Adds `relocation` for classes from `hbase-hadoop2-compat` and `hbase-hadoop-compat`.  There are classes from these two artifacts which implement `org.apache.hadoop.metrics2` classes in `hadoop-common`. We cannot shade all classes in `org.apache.hadoop.metrics2` which would cause `NoClassDef` of hadoop classes. So we have to pick and choose here for HBase-specific ones.\r\n  - Excludes `**/*.proto` and `hbase-webapps/**` from bundles\r\n  - Remove unnecessary dependencies of HBase which are already introduced from `hudi-common` in the bundle poms \r\n- Note that: `hbase-shaded-server` is discontinued and `hbase-shaded` is maintained afterwards, which bundles all HBase related libs, most of which are not needed by us.  So the original `hbase-*` dependencies are used and we control the shading instead.\r\n- Backward compatibility (Hudi 0.11 reader reading tables written by previous releases).  There are two places which read and write HFile, the `HFileBootstrapIndex` and `HoodieHFileReader`/`HoodieHFileWriter`.  Note that the `HFileBootstrapIndex` does not use the `HoodieHFileReader`/`HoodieHFileWriter`.  There are nuances here that affect the backward compatibility, which is considered in this PR.  As already mentioned, HBase 1.x uses `KeyValue.KVComparator` while HBase 2.x uses `CellComparator`, although the conceptual functionality is the same.  The comparator class name is written to the trailer of the HFile.  Below shows the comparator class name written to the HFile trailer in different Hudi + HBase versions:\r\n\r\n| Versions | Class name (Abbr.) written by `HFileBootstrapIndex` | Class name (Abbr.) written by `HoodieHFileWriter` |\r\n| ------------- | ------- | -------- |\r\n| Hudi 0.9.0 based on HBase 1.2.3 | `HFileBootstrapIndex$HoodieKVComparator` | `hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator` |\r\n| Hudi 0.10.0 based on HBase 1.2.3 |`HFileBootstrapIndex$HoodieKVComparator`|`HoodieHBaseKVComparator`|\r\n| Hudi 0.11 (this PR) based on HBase 2.4.9 |`HFileBootstrapIndex$HoodieKVComparator`|`HoodieHBaseKVComparator`|\r\n\r\nFull class name:\r\n`HFileBootstrapIndex$HoodieKVComparator`: `org.apache.hudi.common.bootstrap.index.HFileBootstrapIndex$HoodieKVComparator`\r\n`hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator`: `org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator`\r\n`HoodieHBaseKVComparator`: `org.apache.hudi.io.storage.HoodieHBaseKVComparator`\r\n\r\nThere are no compatibility issues with `HoodieKVComparator` and `HoodieHBaseKVComparator` given that we control the implementation.  For `org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator`, HBase already provides the conversion when retrieving the comparator class in [FixedFileTrailer](https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/rel/2.4.9/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/io/hfile/FixedFileTrailer.java#L609):\r\n```\r\n@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\r\n  private static Class<? extends CellComparator> getComparatorClass(String comparatorClassName)\r\n    throws IOException {\r\n    Class<? extends CellComparator> comparatorKlass;\r\n    // for BC\r\n    if (comparatorClassName.equals(KeyValue.COMPARATOR.getLegacyKeyComparatorName())\r\n      || comparatorClassName.equals(KeyValue.COMPARATOR.getClass().getName())\r\n      || (comparatorClassName.equals(\"org.apache.hadoop.hbase.CellComparator\"))) {\r\n      comparatorKlass = CellComparatorImpl.class;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe `KeyValue.COMPARATOR.getLegacyKeyComparatorName()` returns `org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator` in [KeyValue](https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/rel/2.4.9/hbase-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/KeyValue.java#L1758) class.  In the unit test, it is verified that the HFile written by Hudi 0.9.0 `HoodieHFileWriter` can be read with the comparator transformed to `CellComparatorImpl`.\r\n```\r\n@Deprecated\r\n  public static class KVComparator implements RawComparator<Cell>, SamePrefixComparator<byte[]> {\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * The HFileV2 file format's trailer contains this class name.  We reinterpret this and\r\n     * instantiate the appropriate comparator.\r\n     * TODO: With V3 consider removing this.\r\n     * @return legacy class name for FileFileTrailer#comparatorClassName\r\n     */\r\n    public String getLegacyKeyComparatorName() {\r\n      return \"org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen we package the Hudi bundles, we need to make sure that `org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator` is not shaded, not to break the backward compatibility logic in HBase.  That's why this relocation rule is added:\r\n```\r\n<relocation>\r\n  <pattern>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.</pattern>\r\n  <shadedPattern>org.apache.hudi.org.apache.hadoop.hbase.</shadedPattern>\r\n  <excludes>\r\n    <exclude>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator</exclude>\r\n  </excludes>\r\n</relocation>\r\n```\r\nThe bundle BC logic is verified by using [Java Decompiler](http://java-decompiler.github.io/).  Before excluding the class in shading, the new bundle cannot read Hudi metadata table written by 0.9.0:\r\n<img width=\"1307\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-19 at 17 36 54\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2497195/159344841-7a8c774d-6ff2-432c-a7f9-9e6a4578b99d.png\">\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hudi.org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CorruptHFileException: Problem reading HFile Trailer from file file:/Users/ethan/Work/data/hudi/hudi_0_9_metadata_table/.hoodie/metadata/files/c626cae9-96eb-48c5-ab41-bef60c6037c0-0_0-94-187_003001.hfile\r\n  at org.apache.hudi.org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.HFileInfo.initTrailerAndContext(HFileInfo.java:355)\r\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator\r\n  at org.apache.hudi.org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.FixedFileTrailer.getComparatorClass(FixedFileTrailer.java:627)\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.KeyValue$KeyComparator\r\n  at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:382)\r\n```\r\nAfter excluding the class in shading, the new bundle can read Hudi metadata table written by 0.9.0:\r\n<img width=\"1234\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-21 at 12 08 57\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2497195/159346249-156b772c-806a-4a44-a5a9-da2939f52b8b.png\">\r\n- Forward compatibility (reader of previous Hudi releases reading tables written by Hudi 0.11 writer).  The data table bootstrap index is not affected, supporting forward compatibility.  The metadata table is affected.  The forward compatibility is anyway broken since 0.10, because Hudi 0.9.0 reader cannot read Hudi 0.10/0.11 metadata table due to the comparator class name change, as the new comparator class `HoodieHBaseKVComparator` is not present in Hudi 0.9.0 and before.  However, the metadata table is forward compatible since 0.10.0.\r\n- Add new tests as mentioned below to cover changes in `HoodieHFileReader`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new tests:\r\n- Restructures the tests around `HoodieFileReader` and `HoodieFileWriter` by adding an abstract class `TestHoodieReaderWriterBase` for common tests for all file formats.  Adding more verification `TestHoodieReaderWriterBase` to cover all APIs.  Makes `TestHoodieHFileReaderWriter` and `TestHoodieOrcReaderWriter` extend `TestHoodieReaderWriterBase`.\r\n- Adds more tests in `TestHoodieHFileReaderWriter` to cover HFile specific read and write logic.\r\n- Adds HFile compatibility tests in `TestHoodieHFileReaderWriter` and test fixtures in resources. Three types of HFiles are added for all three Hudi versions (9 HFile fixtures in total).  These are all cases where HFile is used.\r\n  - HFile fixtures generated: (1) HFile based on simple schema generated from `TestHoodieReaderWriterBase#testWriteReadPrimitiveRecord()`; (2) HFile based on complex schema generated from `TestHoodieReaderWriterBase#testWriteReadComplexRecord()`; (3) HFile based on bootstrap index generated from `TestBootstrapIndex#testBootstrapIndex()`.\r\n  - Hudi versions: (1) Hudi 0.9.0 based on HBase 1.2.3 (2) Hudi 0.10.0 based on HBase 1.2.3 (3) Hudi 0.11 (this PR) based on HBase 2.4.9 (the nuances can be found in the above section)\r\n\r\nThis PR is covered by existing unit, functional and CI tests for core write/read flows, compatibility with docker setup of Spark 2.4.4, Hadoop 2.8.4, Hive 2.3.3.\r\n\r\nFurther compatibility testing:\r\n- Write-Read Backward compatibility: Write a hudi table before this change with metadata table enabled (0.9, 0.10, 0.11-this PR), containing HFile base files and log files metadata table.  List partitions and files of the data table using metadata table, with this change.  There is no issue.\r\n- Write-Read Backward compatibility: Write a hudi table with this change with metadata table enabled (0.11-this PR).  Read the table using old releases (0.9, 0.10).  The table can be read.\r\n- Tested on both local and EMR 6.5.0.\r\n\r\nBundle jar:\r\nThe bundle jars are verified so that HBase related classes are properly shaded (`jar tf | grep \"hbase\\|htrace\\|metrics2\\|commons.io\"`) and Google guava is not present (`jar tf | grep guava`).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the size of bundle jars is significantly increased due to new necessary packages (~ 16MB additional size for most of the bundles):\r\n\r\n| Bundle jar file | Master | This PR |\r\n| ------------- | ------- | --------|\r\n| hudi-flink-bundle_2.11-0.11.0-SNAPSHOT.jar |

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nwhen Deltastreamer consumes an empty batch, but checkpoint moved ahead, hudi injects NullSchemaProvider as part of consumed InputBatch. Which returns null schema (Schema.create(Schema.Type.NULL)) schema when asked for source or target schema. So, this gets serialized into commit metadata and later runs into issues when table schema is fetched. \r\n\r\nFix: when serializing the schema to commit metadata, we avoid adding the entry if its null schema (Schema.create(Schema.Type.NULL)).  \r\n\r\nIdeally, we want to fix the schema provider returned as part of empty batch itself. But don't want to fix it right away as it could blow up somewhere else. So, created a [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3596) for later. \r\n\r\nTableSchemaProvider is capable of walking back to previous commits to find the right schema and hence skipping to add schema should be fine. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFixed serializing the avro schema to commit metadata to avoid adding the entry if its null schema (Schema.create(Schema.Type.NULL))\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added a test to TestHoodieDeltastreamer to test the fix.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe latest master of Presto relies on hudi-presto-bundle, while current Presto releases rely on hudi-common and hudi-hadoop-mr 0.9.0, which are pulled in plugin/hive-hadoop2/ in the Docker setup, making it hard to test the latest changes in Hudi due to class conflict.\r\n\r\nAs a temporary workaround, this PR removes `hudi-common-0.9.0.jar` and `hudi-hadoop-mr-0.9.0.jar` in `plugin/hive-hadoop2/` to avoid conflicts with latest hudi-presto-bundle.jar, which is copied from the build.  This PR also upgrades Presto to 0.271, so that the new presto docker image is pushed to `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-prestobase_0.271:latest`.  In this way, if there is any issue with the changes in this PR, we can roll this back without any side effect.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Removes `hudi-common-0.9.0.jar` and `hudi-hadoop-mr-0.9.0.jar` within `plugin/hive-hadoop2/` in `docker/hoodie/hadoop/prestobase/Dockerfile`\r\n- Upgrades Presto from 0.268 to 0.271 in Docker setup\r\n- Pushes new Presto Docker image to `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-prestobase_0.271:latest`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing integration tests.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nSupporting Composite Expressions (including standard Spark functions and UDFs) as Filter Expressions in Data Skipping flow.\r\n\r\nFor example, if previously we were only supporting rather simple expressions over Data Table attributes like `WHERE columnA = 42`, now we will be supporting much broader scope of expressions (strictly defined below) allowing for example Data Skipping to properly digest queries like `WHERE date_format(columnA, 'MM/dd/yyyy') = '01/01/2022'` referencing Spark's standard function `date_format`.\r\n\r\nFormally, now supported are any expressions such that it\r\n\r\n1. References exactly 1 attribute (column, meaning that expressions like `A * B = 0` are not supported)\r\n2. Does not contain sub-queries \r\n\r\nAlso, now as \"value expression\" we support any expression such that it\r\n\r\n1. Does not reference any other attribute (`A = B` filters are not supported)\r\n2. Does not contain sub-queries \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Expanded scope for value expressions\r\n - Expanded scope for attribute expressions\r\n - Fixed `resolveExpr` util to properly resolve Spark functions\r\n - Grouped together logically equivalent expressions\r\n - Added tests\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\nThis change added tests\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-09T06:47:57Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T05:27:16Z","closed_at":"2022-03-25T05:27:15Z","merged_at":"2022-03-25T05:27:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"8b38ddedc2fd1ef048a756faa3531afc06b2c26b","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/4996/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/4996/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4996/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/5bdb3eea3994037216df905bce35765b829f4b03","head":{"label":"onehouseinc:ak/mtmod-idx-2","ref":"ak/mtmod-idx-2","sha":"5bdb3eea3994037216df905bce35765b829f4b03","user":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378248722,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgyNDg3MjI=","name":"hudi","full_name":"onehouseinc/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.git

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to automatically adjust write configs based on metadata table enablement and write concurrency mode, to prevent possible missing configs that are required for enabling metadata table and multi-writer.  Write configs in scope are:\r\n```\r\nhoodie.metadata.enable (read-only in the new logic)\r\nhoodie.write.concurrency.mode (can be auto updated in the new logic)\r\nhoodie.write.lock.provider (can be auto updated in the new logic)\r\nhoodie.cleaner.policy.failed.writes (can be auto updated in the new logic)\r\n```\r\nThe following scenarios are checked:\r\n| Metadata Table | Async Table Services | Lock Provider Set by User | Action |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| Enabled      | Enabled     |  No | Set `hoodie.write.concurrency.mode=optimistic_concurrency_control`, `hoodie.write.lock.provider=org.apache.hudi.client.transaction.lock.InProcessLockProvider` and `hoodie.cleaner.policy.failed.writes=LAZY`  |\r\n| Enabled   | Enabled        | Yes | Set `hoodie.cleaner.policy.failed.writes=LAZY` if user has set `hoodie.write.concurrency.mode=optimistic_concurrency_control` |\r\n| Enabled   | Disabled        | Yes/No | Set `hoodie.cleaner.policy.failed.writes=LAZY` if user has set `hoodie.write.concurrency.mode=optimistic_concurrency_control` |\r\n| Disabled   | Enabled/Disabled        | Yes/No | Set `hoodie.cleaner.policy.failed.writes=LAZY` if user has set `hoodie.write.concurrency.mode=optimistic_concurrency_control` |\r\n\r\nNote that the logic also depends on Hudi table type, since by default, MOR table has async compaction enabled, while COW table has all inline table services.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds auto config adjustment to in `HoodieWriteConfig`.\r\n- Adds unit tests for different user-defined config scenarios in `TestHoodieWriteConfig` to make sure the logic is correct.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change adds tests in `TestHoodieWriteConfig` to verify the logic.\r\n\r\n## Committer

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFor Hudi MOR table, the scheduling of compaction is triggered under certain conditions, configured by `hoodie.compact.inline.trigger.strategy`.  The default triggering condition is the number of delta commits, with the config of `hoodie.compact.inline.max.delta.commits`.  If this setting is larger than the archival config of `hoodie.keep.max.commits`, there is not enough delta commits in the active timeline and the compaction will never happen.\r\n\r\nTo guard around such configs, for MOR table with triggering strategy of `NUM_COMMITS` (trigger compaction when reach N delta commits) and `NUM_AND_TIME` (trigger compaction when both NUM_COMMITS and TIME_ELAPSED are satisfied), the archival always makes sure that there are enough delta commits in the active timeline to trigger compaction scheduling, besides other conditions.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add new logic in `HoodieTimelineArchiver` to make sure that there are enough delta commits in the active timeline to trigger compaction scheduling, when the trigger strategy of compaction is NUM_COMMITS or NUM_AND_TIME.\r\n- Add util methods in `CompactionUtils` and refactor `ScheduleCompactionActionExecutor` to use the same method for checking latest complete compaction and delta commits as `HoodieTimelineArchiver`\r\n- Fix an issue of checking delta commits in active timeline when the timeline does not have any delta commit\r\n- Add new tests for the new logic.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new tests in `TesthoodieTimelineArchiver` and `TestCompactionUtils` for the new logic.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIf clustering/compaction rollback failed mid-way, if rollback of a pending clustering/compaction is re-attempted, a new rollback instant will be generated. We would want to retry using the same rollback instant. Main motivation is that, the old failed rollback instant is never cleaned up. And so it could lead to liveness issues w/ metadata table. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed rolling back of pending clustering/compaction to re-use rollback instant if present. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableInsertUpdateDelete#testRepeatedRollbackOfCompaction\r\n- Added TestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage#testPendingClusteringRollback\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nFix hudi cli metadata commands.  Currently when running hudi cli metadata commands locally, it complains about spark master, e.g., yarn master not found.  The commands need to take in spark related configs so that they can run locally and in cluster.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nLet's take `metadata list-partitions` as an example,\r\nBefore this patch\r\n```\r\n67411 [Spring Shell] INFO  org.apache.spark.SparkContext  - Running Spark version 2.4.4\r\n67442 [Spring Shell] INFO  org.apache.spark.SparkContext  - Submitted application: HoodieCLI\r\n67515 [Spring Shell] INFO  org.apache.spark.SecurityManager  - Changing view acls to: yuezhang\r\n67515 [Spring Shell] INFO  org.apache.spark.SecurityManager  - Changing modify acls to: yuezhang\r\n67516 [Spring Shell] INFO  org.apache.spark.SecurityManager  - Changing view acls groups to: \r\n67516 [Spring Shell] INFO  org.apache.spark.SecurityManager  - Changing modify acls groups to: \r\n67517 [Spring Shell] INFO  org.apache.spark.SecurityManager  - SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users  with view permissions: Set(yuezhang); groups with view permissions: Set(); users  with modify permissions: Set(yuezhang); groups with modify permissions: Set()\r\n67571 [Spring Shell] INFO  org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.deprecation  - mapred.output.compression.codec is deprecated.

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAfter some back-and-forth in our discussions regarding \"spark-avro\", we've finally settled on the following approach:\r\n\r\nHudi will be taking on promise for it bundles to stay compatible with Spark minor versions (for ex 2.4, 3.1, 3.2): meaning that single build of Hudi (for ex \"hudi-spark3.2-bundle\") will be compatible with ALL patch versions in that minor branch (in \r\nthat case 3.2.1, 3.2.0, etc) \r\n\r\nTo achieve that we'll have to remove (and ban) \"spark-avro\" as a dependency, which on a few occasions was the root-cause of incompatibility b/w consecutive Spark _patch_ versions (most recently 3.2.1 and 3.2.0, due to this [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34978)).\r\n\r\nInstead of bundling \"spark-avro\" as dependency, we will be copying over some of the classes Hudi depends on and maintain them along the Hudi code-base to make sure we're able to provide for the aforementioned guarantee. To workaround arising compatibility issues we will be applying local patches to guarantee compatibility of Hudi bundles w/in the Spark minor version branches.\r\n\r\nFollowing Hudi modules to Spark minor branches is currently maintained:\r\n\r\n - \"hudi-spark3\" -> 3.2.x\r\n - \"hudi-spark3.1.x\" -> 3.1.x\r\n - \"hudi-spark2\" -> 2.4.x\r\n\r\nFollowing classes hierarchies (borrowed from \"spark-avro\") are maintained w/in these Spark-specific modules to guarantee compatibility with respective minor version branches:\r\n\r\n - `AvroSerializer` \r\n - `AvroDeserializer`\r\n - `AvroUtils`\r\n\r\nEach of these classes has been correspondingly copied from Spark 3.2.1 (for 3.2.x branch), 3.1.2 (for 3.1.x branch), 2.4.4 (for 2.4.x branch) into their respective modules.\r\n\r\n - `SchemaConverters` class in turn is shared across all those modules given its relative stability (there're only cosmetical changes from 2.4.4 to 3.2.1).\r\n\r\nAll of the aforementioned classes have their corresponding scope of visibility limited to corresponding packages (`org.apache.spark.sql.avro`, `org.apache.spark.sql`) to make sure broader code-base does not become dependent on them and instead relies on facades abstracting them.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, given that Hudi plans on supporting all the patch versions of Spark w/in aforementioned minor versions branches of Spark, additional build steps were added to validate that Hudi could be properly compiled against those versions. Testing, however, is performed against the most recent patch versions of Spark with the help of Azure CI.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Removing spark-avro bundling from Hudi by default\r\n - Scaffolded Spark 3.2.x hierarchy\r\n - Bootstrapped Spark 3.1.x Avro serializer/deserializer hierarchy\r\n - Bootstrapped Spark 2.4.x Avro serializer/deserializer hierarchy\r\n - Moved ExpressionCodeGen,ExpressionPayload into hudi-spark module\r\n - Fixed AvroDeserializer to stay compatible w/ both Spark 3.2.1 and 3.2.0\r\n - Modified bot.yml to build full matrix of support Spark versions\r\n - Removed \"spark-avro\" dependency from all modules\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the \"oci\" scheme for using Hudi against Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using its HDFS Client.\r\n\r\nI have documentation which I will put in another PR, apologies if I could have combined across branches I'm bad at git.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n  - Registered OCI scheme, indicating appends are not supported.\r\n  - Added a test similar to existing tests for other schemes.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is pretty trivial. I validated it using the Hudi quickstart and results were the same as using a local path.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [X] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [X] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green - unknown.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nPopulateMetafields value for metadata table will never get updated once metadata table get initialized for the first time. With 0.11, we are making populate meta fields as false for metadata table which was true by default in 0.10.0. So fixing the update in this patch by re-initializing the metaclient if property value has changed. Every other property is statically configured except this config which user can override. hence had to fix just one property. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd re-intialization of metadata table metaclient and table config if populate meta fields have changed. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull requests\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n-

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds thread factory  in BoundedInMemoryExecutor.\r\n\r\nUnder the old code, we could not clearly distinguish the role of each thread in the thread dump during the data merging phase of the MOR table. So I added a CustomizedThreadFactory class. And added a thread pool factory name that can be used to identify the role of the thread for BoundedInMemoryExecutor.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFor r0.9.0 and before, there is a bug that the markers from compaction action are not cleaned up after the commit is complete.  There is a fix going in after r0.9.0 and before r0.10.0 regarding the marker cleanup for compaction: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3576.  For tables with r0.9.0 and before, the makers are going to exist without cleanup.\r\n\r\nWe should clean up the Hudi markers of completed commits inside .temp if they are not cleaned up due to older release.  This process can be inside upgrade process and a cli command as well. \r\n\r\nJira

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nI'm running Flink with Hudi in Java 11 environment(Even through I know Hudi might only support Java8/9/10), But we cannot change our JDK version. Based on this situation, We meet a NPE problem during `HoodieWriteConfig.getIndexType()`, but I test that it works in my local Java 8 environment. It seems that we implemented a `TypedProperties` class inherit  from `java.util.Properties` class, and overwrite `stringPropertyNames` method & `put` method from this [PR](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4712).\r\n\r\nThere are some difference of `Properties.putAll(Map<?,?> t)` between Java 8 and Java 11. \r\n\r\n*Java 8*: `TypedProperties`  will use HashTable's `putAll` method, which will call `TypedProperties.put` method, and the latter will add the incoming keys in `TypedProperties.keys` field.\r\n```\r\npublic synchronized void putAll(Map<? extends K, ? extends V> t) {\r\n        for (Map.Entry<? extends K, ? extends V> e : t.entrySet())\r\n            put(e.getKey(), e.getValue());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Java 11*: `Properties` overwrite `putAll` method, and delegate the  incoming map to `ConcurrentHashMap`. It won't call `TypedProperties.put` method anymore, which lead the `TypedProperties.keys` fields miss some keys, and then it cause that we miss the `hoodie.index.type` configuration.\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n    public synchronized void putAll(Map<?, ?> t) {\r\n        map.putAll(t);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we also need to overwrite `putAll` method to better  suitable high Java version runtime.\r\n\r\nThe exception trace with Java 11 runtime.\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Name is null\r\n\tat

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWith latest addition of TypedProperties in HoodieTableConfig, we ran into issues w/ kafka key and value serializer types in properties. Apparently value type was class and hence when getting string values, it returns null values while populating TypedProperties. Fixed all such instances of key.serializer and value.serializer instantiations. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFixed all instantiations of key.serializer and value.serializer to ensure value is of type string. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\ndocker demo runs successfully w/o NPE w/ this patch. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title &
