This problem is raised by [SPARK-21391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21391).\r\n\r\nThe issue happens in `ExternalMapToCatalyst`. For example, the following codes create `ExternalMapToCatalyst` to convert Scala Map to catalyst map format.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval data = Seq.tabulate(10)(i => NestedData(1, Map(\"key\" -> InnerData(\"name\", i + 100))))\r\nval ds = spark.createDataset(data)\r\n```\r\nThe `valueConverter` in `ExternalMapToCatalyst` looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (isnull(lambdavariable(ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52, ExternalMapToCatalyst_value_isNull52, ObjectType(class org.apache.spark.sql.InnerData), true))) null else named_struct(name, staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, assertnotnull(lambdavariable(ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52, ExternalMapToCatalyst_value_isNull52, ObjectType(class org.apache.spark.sql.InnerData), true)).name, true), value, assertnotnull(lambdavariable(ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52, ExternalMapToCatalyst_value_isNull52, ObjectType(class org.apache.spark.sql.InnerData), true)).value)\r\n```\r\nThere is a `CreateNamedStruct` expression (`named_struct`) to create a row of `InnerData.name` and `InnerData.value` that are referred by `ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52`.\r\n\r\nBecause `ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52` are local variable, when `CreateNamedStruct` splits expressions to individual functions, the local variable can't be accessed anymore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test suite into `DatasetPrimitiveSuite`\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-13T16:16:33Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T18:45:05Z","closed_at":"2017-07-13T18:01:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c30b2f7c17caf8855e4c5fdb0efe725f1f16e322","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18626/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18626/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18626/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a6985cffc89ad3b4c47f5ff5720e9d64ea173137","head":{"label":"kiszk:branch-2.1","ref":"branch-2.1","sha":"a6985cffc89ad3b4c47f5ff5720e9d64ea173137","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.2, we have optimized ALS recommendForAll, which uses a handwriting matrix multiplication, and get the topK items for each matrix. The method effectively reduce the GC problem. However, Native BLAS GEMM, like Intel MKL, and OpenBLAS, the performance of matrix multiplication is about 10X comparing with handwriting method.\r\n\r\nI have rewritten the code of recommendForAll with GEMM, and got about 50% improvement comparing with the master recommendForAll method.\r\n\r\nThe key point of this optimization:\r\n1), use GEMM to replace hand-written matrix multiplication. \r\n2), Use matrix to keep temp result, largely reduce GC and computing time.  The master method create many small objects, which causes using GEMM directly cannot get good performance.\r\n3), Use sort and merge to get the topK items, which don't need to call priority queue two times.\r\n\r\nTest Result:\r\n479818 users, 13727 products, rank = 10, topK = 20.\r\n3 workers, each with 35 cores. Native BLAS is Intel MKL.\r\nBlock Size:       1000===2000===4000===8000 \r\nMaster Method:40s-----39.4s-----39.5s----39.1s\r\nThis Method     26.5s---25.9s----26s-----27.1s\r\n\r\nPerformance Improvement: (OldTime - NewTime)/NewTime = about 50%\r\n    \r\n \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review

request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-13T12:15:18Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T16:18:34Z","closed_at":"2018-01-15T16:18:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d42f34394242a0e823a506071c005933ac2eacdf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18624/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18624/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18624/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f36706ae46f4b0562b1d85627a526fcf642e913c","head":{"label":"mpjlu:OptimizeAlsByGEMM","ref":"OptimizeAlsByGEMM","sha":"f36706ae46f4b0562b1d85627a526fcf642e913c","user":{"login":"mpjlu","id":13826327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODI2MzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13826327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu","html_url":"https://github.com/mpjlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64218821,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDIxODgyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"mpjlu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mpjlu","id":13826327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODI2MzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13826327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu","html_url":"https://github.com/mpjlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mpjlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mpjlu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSparkHadoopUtil.globPath method uses incorrect configuration to retrieve instance of org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.\r\n \r\nAccidentally, this can work correctly for two reasons:\r\n -  Filesystem cache is enabled by default for all filesystems which are derived from org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem\r\n -  Configuration is not considered when instance of FileSystem is retrieved from the cache - it is not used to identify cache's key.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, incorrect configuration is omitted in SparkHadoopUtil.globPath and previously initialized instance of FileSystem is returned with correct configuration. \r\n\r\nHowever, if filesystem caching is disabled (non-default behavior) incorrect configuration in SparkHadoopUtils.globPath is passed to org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.get() method what creates new instance of FileSystem with this incorrect configuration. \r\n\r\nIn this change two overloaded methods (globPath and globPathIfNecessary) are added to SparkHadoopUtil class which can receive up to date configuration from caller method. These two methods are used in DataSource class to read into DataFrame from globbed path. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n./dev/run-tests passed + example from SPARK-21374 was tested with patched jars.\r\n\r\n@zsxwing @liancheng

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes `StructType.fieldNames` that returns a copy of a field name list rather than a (undocumented) `StructType.names`.\r\n\r\nThere are two points here:\r\n\r\n  - API consistency with Scala/Java\r\n\r\n  - Provide a safe way to get the field names. Manipulating these might cause unexpected behaviour as below:\r\n \r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n\r\n\r\n    struct = StructType([StructField(\"f1\", StringType(), True)])\r\n    names = struct.names\r\n    del names[0]\r\n    spark.createDataFrame([{\"f1\": 1}], struct).show()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ...\r\n    java.lang.IllegalStateException: Input row doesn't have expected number of values required by the schema. 1 fields are required while 0 values are provided.\r\n    \tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.python.EvaluatePython$.fromJava(EvaluatePython.scala:138)\r\n    \tat org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession$$anonfun$6.apply(SparkSession.scala:741)\r\n    \tat org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession$$anonfun$6.apply(SparkSession.scala:741)\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis issue happens in long running application with yarn cluster mode, because yarn#client doesn't sync token with AM, so it will always keep the initial token, this token may be expired in the long running scenario, so when yarn#client tries to clean up staging directory after application finished, it will use this expired token and meet

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this issue we have a long running Spark application with secure HBase, which requires `HBaseCredentialProvider` to get tokens periodically, we specify HBase related jars with `--packages`, but these dependencies are not added into AM classpath, so when `HBaseCredentialProvider` tries to initialize HBase connections to get tokens, it will be failed.\r\n\r\nCurrently because jars specified with `--jars` or `--packages` are not added into AM classpath, the only way to extend AM classpath is to use \"spark.driver.extraClassPath\" which supposed to be used in yarn cluster mode.\r\n\r\nSo in this fix, we proposed to use/reuse a classloader for `AMCredentialRenewer` to acquire new tokens.\r\n\r\nAlso in this patch, we fixed AM cannot get tokens from HDFS issue, it is because FileSystem is gotten before kerberos logged, so using this FS to get tokens will throw exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual verification.","created_at":"2017-07-12T23:53:52Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T20:14:09Z","closed_at":"2017-07-17T20:14:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb40eabcd9df65026371d7ac618a30e681b55d5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7dbc7269713dd4eff29bbdbf27e89152d9ee78e3","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-21377","ref":"SPARK-21377","sha":"7dbc7269713dd4eff29bbdbf27e89152d9ee78e3","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ClassLoader` will preferentially load class from `parent`. Only when `parent` is null or the load failed, that it will call the overridden `findClass` function. To avoid the potential issue caused by loading class using inappropriate class loader, we should set the `parent` of `ClassLoader` to null, so that we can fully control which class loader is used.\r\n\r\nThis is take over of #17074,  the primary author of this PR is @taroplus .\r\n\r\nShould close #17074 after this PR get merged.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd test case

with blacklisting\r\n\r\nThere's a race condition in the current TaskSetManager where a failed task is added for retry (addPendingTask), and can asynchronously be assigned to an executor *prior* to the blacklist state (updateBlacklistForFailedTask), the result is the task might re-execute on the same executor.  This is particularly problematic if the executor is shutting down since the retry task immediately becomes a lost task (ExecutorLostFailure).  Another side effect is that the actual failure reason gets obscured by the retry task which never actually executed.  There are sample logs showing the issue in the https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21219\r\n\r\nThe fix is to change the ordering of the addPendingTask and updatingBlackListForFailedTask calls in TaskSetManager.handleFailedTask\r\n\r\nImplemented a unit test that verifies the task is black listed before it is added to the pending task.  Ran the unit test without the fix and it fails.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDuring Streaming Aggregation, we have two StateStores per task, one used as read-only in\r\n`StateStoreRestoreExec`, and one read-write used in `StateStoreSaveExec`. `StateStore.abort`\r\nwill be called for these StateStores if they haven't committed their results. We need to\r\nmake sure that `abort` in read-only store after a `commit` in the read-write store doesn't\r\naccidentally lead to the deletion of state.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a test for this condition.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR propose a new configuration \"spark.yarn.am.extraClassPath\" to extend AM classpath in yarn client mode. The specific scenario is that we have custom `ServiceCredentialProvider` which will be loaded in AM, and this provider requires its additional dependencies to be added in AM classpath. \r\n\r\nUsing \"spark.driver.extraClassPath\" (the current code) is not so proper in yarn client mode and if dependency paths are different for driver and AM node, then it is impossible to use this configuration. So instead we add a new configuration to extend AM classpath in yarn client mode.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT added and manual verification on local cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-11T21:09:40Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T22:33:37Z","closed_at":"2017-07-11T22:33:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9589f89da61db5e8154dad2f9a2f0ae719346ace","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6f9135645cd767e9d69d98157189c2e7ba08a5cc","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-21377","ref":"SPARK-21377","sha":"6f9135645cd767e9d69d98157189c2e7ba08a5cc","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `RowDataSourceScanExec` and `FileSourceScanExec` rely on a \"metadata\" string map to implement equality comparison, since the RDDs they depend on cannot be directly compared. This has resulted in a number of correctness bugs around exchange reuse, e.g. SPARK-17673 and SPARK-16818.\r\n\r\nTo make these comparisons less brittle, we should refactor these classes to compare constructor parameters directly instead of relying on the metadata map.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors `RowDataSourceScanExec`, `FileSourceScanExec` will be fixed in the follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the HDFSBackedStateStore sets it's state as UPDATING as it is initialized.\r\nFor every trigger, we create two state stores, one used during \"Restore\" and one during \"Save\". The \"Restore\" StateStore is read-only. This state store gets \"aborted\" after a task is completed, which results in a file being created and immediately deleted.\r\nThis can be avoided if there is an INITIALIZED state and abort deletes files only when there is an update to the state store using \"put\" or \"remove\".\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `StateStoreSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-11T00:42:10Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:54:06Z","closed_at":"2017-07-11T02:20:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6bd6611019a08a4025a2610e17fed735e9f4f1b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18595/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18595/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18595/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/95e04fa04c44c6ed13f91b8e06bf39ffe83719e0","head":{"label":"brkyvz:read-only-state-store","ref":"read-only-state-store","sha":"95e04fa04c44c6ed13f91b8e06bf39ffe83719e0","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR deals with four points as below:\r\n\r\n- Reuse existing DDL parser APIs rather than reimplementing within PySpark\r\n\r\n- Support DDL formatted string, `field type, field type`.\r\n\r\n- Support case-insensitivity for parsing.\r\n\r\n- Support nested data types as below:\r\n\r\n  **Before**\r\n  ```\r\n  >>> spark.createDataFrame([[[1]]], \"struct<a: struct<b: int>>\").show()\r\n  ...\r\n  ValueError: The strcut field string format is: 'field_name:field_type', but got: a: struct<b: int>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the direction of expression transformation in the DecimalPrecision rule. Previously, the expressions were transformed down, which led to incorrect result types when decimal expressions had other decimal expressions as their operands. The root cause of this issue was in visiting outer nodes before their children. Consider the example below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    val inputSchema = StructType(StructField(\"col\", DecimalType(26, 6)) :: Nil)\r\n    val sc = spark.sparkContext\r\n    val rdd = sc.parallelize(1 to 2).map(_ => Row(BigDecimal(12)))\r\n    val df = spark.createDataFrame(rdd, inputSchema)\r\n\r\n    // Works correctly since no nested decimal expression is involved\r\n    // Expected result type: (26, 6) * (26, 6) = (38, 12)\r\n    df.select($\"col\" * $\"col\").explain(true)\r\n    df.select($\"col\" * $\"col\").printSchema()\r\n\r\n    // Gives a wrong result since there is a nested decimal expression that should be visited first\r\n    // Expected result type: ((26, 6) * (26, 6)) * (26, 6) = (38, 12) * (26, 6) = (38, 18)\r\n    df.select($\"col\" * $\"col\" * $\"col\").explain(true)\r\n    df.select($\"col\" * $\"col\" * $\"col\").printSchema()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe example above gives the following output: \r\n\r\n```\r\n// Correct result without sub-expressions\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project [('col * 'col) AS (col * col)#4]\r\n+- LogicalRDD [col#1]\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\n(col * col): decimal(38,12)\r\nProject [CheckOverflow((promote_precision(cast(col#1 as decimal(26,6))) * promote_precision(cast(col#1 as decimal(26,6)))), DecimalType(38,12)) AS (col * col)#4]\r\n+- LogicalRDD [col#1]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [CheckOverflow((col#1 * col#1), DecimalType(38,12)) AS (col * col)#4]\r\n+- LogicalRDD [col#1]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Project [CheckOverflow((col#1 * col#1), DecimalType(38,12)) AS (col * col)#4]\r\n+- Scan ExistingRDD[col#1]\r\n\r\n// Schema\r\nroot\r\n |-- (col * col): decimal(38,12) (nullable = true)\r\n\r\n\r\n// Incorrect result with sub-expressions\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project [(('col * 'col) * 'col) AS ((col * col) * col)#11]\r\n+- LogicalRDD [col#1]\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\n((col * col) * col): decimal(38,12)\r\nProject [CheckOverflow((promote_precision(cast(CheckOverflow((promote_precision(cast(col#1 as decimal(26,6))) * promote_precision(cast(col#1 as decimal(26,6)))), DecimalType(38,12)) as decimal(26,6))) * promote_precision(cast(col#1 as decimal(26,6)))), DecimalType(38,12)) AS ((col * col) * col)#11]\r\n+- LogicalRDD [col#1]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [CheckOverflow((cast(CheckOverflow((col#1 * col#1), DecimalType(38,12)) as decimal(26,6)) * col#1), DecimalType(38,12)) AS ((col * col) * col)#11]\r\n+- LogicalRDD [col#1]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Project [CheckOverflow((cast(CheckOverflow((col#1 * col#1), DecimalType(38,12)) as decimal(26,6)) * col#1), DecimalType(38,12)) AS ((col * col) * col)#11]\r\n+- Scan ExistingRDD[col#1]\r\n\r\n// Schema\r\nroot\r\n |-- ((col * col) * col): decimal(38,12) (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR was tested with available unit tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr added a new optimizer rule `UpdateNullabilityInAttributeReferences ` to update the nullability that `Filter` changes when having

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nun-aliased subquery is supported by Spark SQL for a long time. Its semantic was not well defined and had confusing behaviors, and it's not a standard SQL syntax, so we disallowed it in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20690 .\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a breaking change, and we do have existing queries using un-aliased subquery. We should add the support back and fix its semantic.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the un-aliased subquery by assigning a default alias name.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, there is no syntax change from branch 2.2 to master, but we invalid a weird use case:\r\n`SELECT v.i from (SELECT i FROM v)`. Now this query will throw analysis exception because users should not be able to use the qualifier inside a subquery.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is related with [SPARK-19918](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19918) and [SPARK-18362](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18362).\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `TextFileFormat` and allow multiple input paths (but with a warning) when determining the number of features in LibSVM data source via an extra scan.\r\n\r\nThere are three points here:\r\n\r\n- The main advantage of this change should be to remove file-listing bottlenecks in driver side.\r\n\r\n- Another advantage is ones from using `FileScanRDD`. For example, I guess we can use `spark.sql.files.ignoreCorruptFiles` option when determining the number of features.\r\n\r\n- We can unify the schema inference code path in text based data sources. This is also a preparation for [SPARK-21289](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21289).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `LibSVMRelationSuite`.\r\n\r\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently `ArrayConstructor` handles an array of typecode `'l'` as `int` when converting Python object in Python 2 into Java object, so if the value is larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` or smaller than `Integer.MIN_VALUE` then the overflow occurs.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport array\r\ndata = [Row(longarray=array.array('l', [-9223372036854775808, 0, 9223372036854775807]))]\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(data)\r\ndf.show(truncate=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------+\r\n|longarray |\r\n+----------+\r\n|[0, 0,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUnsafeExternalRowSorter.RowComparator contains references to the objects\r\nbacking the last arrays sorted. This causes memory leaks, since those\r\nobjects become deallocated but are still live.\r\n\r\nWe make sure to unset them.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNot sure how to explicitly test this.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current code, it is expensive to use `UnboundedFollowingWindowFunctionFrame`, because it is iterating from the start to lower bound every time calling `write` method. When traverse the iterator, it's possible to skip some spilled files thus to save some time.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test\r\n\r\nDid a small test for benchmark:\r\n\r\nPut 2000200 rows into `UnsafeExternalSorter`-- 2 spill files(each contains 1000000 rows) and inMemSorter contains 200 rows.\r\nMove the iterator forward to index=2000001.\r\n\r\n*With this change*: \r\n`getIterator(2000001)`, it will cost almost 0ms~1ms;\r\n*Without this change*:\r\n`for(int i=0; i<2000001; i++)geIterator().loadNext()`, it will cost 300ms.","created_at":"2017-07-05T10:25:21Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T03:50:23Z","closed_at":"2017-07-11T03:50:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a20af5aa194466dc709bb32767d72537ad6985e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c319dc98db6cbb7a25b7fed4d8528c8a9c5d1e59","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-21315","ref":"SPARK-21315","sha":"c319dc98db6cbb7a25b7fed4d8528c8a9c5d1e59","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLong values can be passed to `rangeBetween` as range frame boundaries, but we silently convert it to Int values, this can cause wrong results and we should fix this.\r\n\r\nFurther more, we should accept any legal literal values as range frame boundaries. In this PR, we make it possible for Long values, and make accepting other DataTypes really easy to add.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mostly based on Herman's previous amazing work: https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark/commit/596f53c339b1b4629f5651070e56a8836a397768\r\n\r\nAfter this been merged, we can close #16818 .\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new tests in `DataFrameWindowFunctionsSuite` and `TypeCoercionSuite`.","created_at":"2017-07-05T09:14:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T08:38:31Z","closed_at":"2017-07-29T17:14:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f7648e1c8d773d5ed81e7b0c145fb84ad684b45","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18540/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18540/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18540/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/38b04df792caf298da63be565d1b46a4eae93d98","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:rangeFrame","ref":"rangeFrame","sha":"38b04df792caf298da63be565d1b46a4eae93d98","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ClusteringEvaluator Evaluator which contains two metrics:\r\n - **cosineSilhouette**: the Silhouette measure using the cosine distance;\r\n - **squaredSilhouette**: the Silhouette measure using the squared Euclidean distance.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the two metrics refers to the algorithm proposed and explained [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Hyo%5f%5fbG%5f3fdkNvSVNYX2E3ZU0/view). These algorithms have been thought for a distributed and parallel environment, thus they have reasonable performance, unlike a naive Silhouette implementation following its definition.\r\n\r\n## How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`SessionState` is designed to be created lazily. However, in reality, it created immediately in `SparkSession.Builder.getOrCreate` ([here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSession.scala#L943)).\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to recover the lazy behavior by keeping the options into `initialSessionOptions`. The benefit is like the following. Users can start `spark-shell` and use RDD operations without any problems.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\n$ bin/spark-shell\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error while instantiating 'org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveSessionStateBuilder'\r\n...\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException:\r\n    org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException:\r\n

reported in SPARK-20256, this happens when the warehouse directory is not allowed for this user.\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```scala\r\n$ bin/spark-shell\r\n...\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds a sandbox link per driver in the dispatcher ui with minimal changes after a bug was fixed here:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-4992\r\nThe sandbox uri has the following format:\r\nhttp://<proxy_uri>/#/slaves/\\<agent-id\\>/ frameworks/ \\<scheduler-id\\>/executors/\\<driver-id\\>/browse\r\n\r\nFor dc/os the proxy uri is <dc/os uri>/mesos. For the dc/os deployment scenario and to make things easier I introduced a new config property named `spark.mesos.proxy.baseURL` which should be passed to the dispatcher when launched using --conf. If no such configuration is detected then no sandbox uri is depicted, and there is an empty column with a header (this can be changed so nothing is shown). \r\n\r\nWithin dc/os the base url must be a property for the dispatcher that we should add in the future here:\r\nhttps://github.com/mesosphere/universe/blob/9e7c909c3b8680eeb0494f2a58d5746e3bab18c1/repo/packages/S/spark/26/config.json\r\nIt is not easy to detect in different environments what is that uri so user should pass it. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTested with the mesos test suite here: https://github.com/typesafehub/mesos-spark-integration-tests.\r\nAttached image shows the ui modification where the sandbox header is added.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/27831630-2a3b447e-60d4-11e7-87bb-d057efd4efa7.png)\r\n\r\nTested the uri redirection the way it was suggested here:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-4992\r\n\r\nBuilt mesos 1.4 from the master branch and started the mesos dispatcher with the command:\r\n\r\n`./sbin/start-mesos-dispatcher.sh --conf spark.mesos.proxy.baseURL=http://localhost:5050 -m mesos://127.0.0.1:5050`\r\n\r\nRun a spark example:\r\n\r\n`./bin/spark-submit   --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi   --master mesos://10.10.1.79:7078   --deploy-mode cluster   --executor-memory 2G   --total-executor-cores 2     http://<path>/spark-examples_2.11-2.1.1.jar  10`\r\n\r\nSandbox uri is shown at the bottom of the page:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/28599237-89d0a8c8-71b1-11e7-8f94-41ad117ceead.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nRedirection works as expected:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/28599247-a5d65248-71b1-11e7-8b5e-a0ac2a79fa23.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-04T13:20:23Z","updated_at":"2017-08-07T09:34:52Z","closed_at":"2017-08-07T09:34:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e22a9ff26da97604803fabb8e1e3841b53cd33b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18528/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18528/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18528/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2dbf2e89d338ef82d29b58663dccbeffa6956415","head":{"label":"skonto:adds_the_sandbox_uri","ref":"adds_the_sandbox_uri","sha":"2dbf2e89d338ef82d29b58663dccbeffa6956415","user":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48892104,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODg5MjEwNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"skonto/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skonto/spark","description":"Mirror
