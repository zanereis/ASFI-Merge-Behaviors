builds are timing out after running for an hour. I have tracked down the issue to the use of LogByteSizeMergePolicy for merges. Lucene tests randomly select merge policy from the two choices, one of them being LogByteSize. There are two conditions necessary for the issue to be triggered:\n- LogByteSizeMergePolicy needs to be selected by random switches\n- mergePolicy.NoCFSRatio needs to be set to something between 0.0 and 1.0\n\nWhen these two conditions are true, segment merge keeps on running merges over and over and over again until out of memory is reached or segments to be merged list is greater than max

PR contains fixes for segment merging logic for numeric and binary fields. Lucene.Net port was ignoring docsWithField parameter and as a result the merged segment had incorrect values in field infos.  \n\nSegmentMerger needs to pass docsWithField downstream so that the iterators could use it to determine which value to return for byte or numeric fields. Here is the Lucene version, https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_8_0/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/SegmentMerger.java#L159, you can see how docsWithField is passed to Merge\\* calls.\n\nSubsequently, re-introduced docsWithField usage in DocValuesConsumer. Here is the Lucene version for reference: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_8_0/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/codecs/DocValuesConsumer.java. Note how it uses docsWithField to determine if to return null or a value.\n\nAnd then related to that BinaryDocValuesWriter also needs to use docsWithField list to return proper BytesRef values. Here is Lucene version for reference: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_8_0/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/index/BinaryDocValuesWriter.java\n\nAlso removed commented out ports of iterators.

while debugging failing Lucene42/45 codec tests that sometimes when a test ran ForceMerge(1) on an index writer, the merge of segments did not occur and the directory contained whatever the number of segments existed before the merge. The tests then proceeded to fail as they expected only one segment to be in the index.\n\nThe issue is LogByteSizeMergePolicy. It does not occur all the time in the tests as its selection is random (https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.TestFramework/Util/LuceneTestCase.cs#L977). LogByteSizeMergePolicy policy in constructor sets the max size of the segment for forced merges. The value always ends up being too large for the long type and gets overflown, ie set to a negative value. This then caused LogMergePolicy to inappropriately mark small segments as too large at this logic branch:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Index/LogMergePolicy.cs#L433\n\nI double checked that Java does indeed behave by not setting the value to a negative number and instead setting it to long.MaxValue. Looks like the previous port developers dealt with this before as well :) https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENENET-282 \n\nNote that this does not fix all of the tests that use ForceMerges, most of them continue to fail due to another bug, but the fix for that is coming up in a separate PR.\n","created_at":"2015-01-25T01:56:56Z","updated_at":"2015-12-06T13:15:49Z","closed_at":"2015-01-25T02:03:50Z","merged_at":"2015-01-25T02:03:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2f418e570192e3b1aa083e4b2b31ad32ccfc667","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/58/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/58/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/58/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/593231b3b39cb81dfcd29ea81cf98dc1ba9a026a","head":{"label":"laimis:LogByteSizeMergePolicy_fixes","ref":"LogByteSizeMergePolicy_fixes","sha":"593231b3b39cb81dfcd29ea81cf98dc1ba9a026a","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c2cd0e11c2a4953091c7f31508a03990900742b6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

server.\n","created_at":"2015-01-22T03:28:29Z","updated_at":"2015-01-22T05:14:13Z","closed_at":"2015-01-22T05:13:39Z","merged_at":"2015-01-22T05:13:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"0320e3aff49820a1b034034640cb32a6fdcc6fed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/55/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/55/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/55/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/2b48ed0ef38fa26a3e3ccce0fa3fdde6079dbbdd","head":{"label":"wwb:master","ref":"master","sha":"2b48ed0ef38fa26a3e3ccce0fa3fdde6079dbbdd","user":{"login":"wwb","id":141044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTA0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb","html_url":"https://github.com/wwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"547b69f5130a404918b05f6def788eda32df1c11","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

PR contains fixes for numerous bugs in Lucene42 codec port, especially around FST functionality. \n\nFirst commit is all about changing from long to long? for FST instances to make sure that code branches such as this one https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Util/Fst/FST.cs#L465 evaluate properly. With long, Outputs.Merge gets called when it should not have and then an exception \"Specified method is not supported.\" is thrown. (here is one example in TC: http://teamcity.codebetter.com/viewLog.html?buildId=178533&tab=buildResultsDiv&buildTypeId=LuceneNet_Core#testNameId8117509285720903580)\n\nThen once the fix allowed further code execution, noticed that FST and some other classes related to it use cast to object when comparing generic type values. Equals should be used as that will work for reference and value types properly. Next commits take care of that.\n\nThis also gets a bunch of TestLucene42DocValuesFormat tests to pass.\n","created_at":"2015-01-18T03:13:19Z","updated_at":"2015-01-18T11:05:24Z","closed_at":"2015-01-18T03:23:24Z","merged_at":"2015-01-18T03:23:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4216f3c1a040e199b21aab4e292777136f7530c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/50/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/50/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/50/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/a83698970db903b2de2a02548b1946934ffc7220","head":{"label":"laimis:Lucene42_fixes","ref":"Lucene42_fixes","sha":"a83698970db903b2de2a02548b1946934ffc7220","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ab58fa245516076f6aa2322af1998cbf61777b0d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

a nullable long in DocValuesConsumer, instead of using just long. The need for this is best illustrated if you look at the changes in Lucene45DocValuesConsumer and in NumericDocValuesWriter. The Writer had iterator implementation that did not match Lucene version, ignoring cases of DocsWithField.Get(doc) evaluating to false in which case a null value needs to be returned. Null value executes a code branch in Lucene45DocValuesConsumer that was simply ignored before. The result of that is the resulting index structure being incorrect, and requests such as DocsWithFields would return true for all documents even though the index had documents that did not have a field in question. \n\nThe tests that used to break are in TestLucene45DocValuesFormat and TestPerFieldDocValuesFormat, e.g. BaseDocValuesFormatTestCase.TestTwoNumbersOneMissing. This fixes about 20 failing tests by my count.\n\nI was considering porting over Numeric class over, but I think we can do that in stages, if necessary. Since all the signatures were using long, migrating to long? was the first step to get the logic right and tests passing.

null reference exception that can be observed at times in some of the TestCompressingStoredFieldsFormat and TestCompressingTermVectorsFormat tests. The issue is that those tests set Codec to CompressingCodec using CompressingCodec.RandomInstance which can result in HighCompressionCompressingCodec being used. HighCompressionCompressingCodec in turn uses decompressor that has a bug. The fix removes instantiation of a separate byte buffer in the Inflater and instead uses the buffer that was provided in the call. Instantiating a new buffer essentially wrote bits to an array that no upstream code used. So the callers were getting empty bytes buffer back always. There might be more test that were affected by this.\n","created_at":"2015-01-05T01:28:35Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T13:20:37Z","closed_at":"2015-01-05T05:32:32Z","merged_at":"2015-01-05T05:32:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"6cc79f6d7eaf6aa1e252cba3a260d30a4e616ced","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/42/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/42/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/42/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/39ae8f9f0ec9705a81f736215123e73964f6ef07","head":{"label":"laimis:Inflater_fix","ref":"Inflater_fix","sha":"39ae8f9f0ec9705a81f736215123e73964f6ef07","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"67f47ad1b63cc2b9b9758d7b4e68e40c129f1226","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

fixes a bunch of test failures with tests in Lucene.Net.Analysis that look something like this:\n\nLengths are not the same: mixedUp = 䧢ൄ^V, length = 3, sb = 񤧢ൄ^V, length = 4\n  Expected: True\n  But was:  False\n\nLengths are not the same: mixedUp = ۀ^A迥ȟ, length = 6, sb = ۀ^A񘿥Ȟ, length = 7\n  Expected: True\n  But was:  False\n\nThe issue is with a code path that is invoked only in certain conditions from here: https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.TestFramework/Util/TestUtil.cs#L1415\n\nWhen debugging the tests, it became apparent that the chars were \"dropped\" in the re-casing function (https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.TestFramework/Util/TestUtil.cs#L707). If the randomly generated string contained Unicode surrogate pairs, the resulting string was shorter and did not correctly match the source string (besides the casing part).\n\nThe drop happens because casts of the code point that represents a surrogate pairs to char (eg. (char)codePoint) is inaccurate, the value is too large for 16 bits. The conversion ends up changing the re-cased char with a completely different character. And then only one character gets appended to the destination string builder when the source used two chars (high and low surrogate), thus the resulting string is shorter by one or more chars (depending on how many surrogate pairs were present in the source string).\n\nI looked at the Java implementation (https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/lucene_solr_4_8_0/lucene/test-framework/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/TestUtil.java#L543) and it makes sense why it works there. Java's Character toUpper / toLower handle code points appropriately, without casting them to chars. It then also uses StringBuilder's appendCodePoint and not append to make sure that code point for surrogate pairs results in two characters being appended.\n\nI considered two options for the implementation. One which contained extension method for StringBuilder for AppendCodePoint which would add two appropriate chars for surrogate pair code point but then still had issues with how to appropriately deal with to Lower / Upper methods for all the possible code points. Java's Character version has implementation for properly selecting unicode planes that the code point belongs to and each plane has an appropriate implementation of those methods. Such functionality does not appear to be exposed in .NET, at least publicly.\n\nSo I settled on the implementation that you can see in this branch. Basically it detects if the next char pair is a surrogate pair and then takes them both for possible casing function and appending to the string builder. All tests in Analysis pass after this change.\n\nI renamed the function to appropriately reflect that code points are not used anymore.\n","created_at":"2014-12-29T02:29:59Z","updated_at":"2014-12-29T14:05:18Z","closed_at":"2014-12-29T10:16:47Z","merged_at":"2014-12-29T10:16:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"310204f883b78d2b7abe9446087f54601a91aa84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/31/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/31/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/31/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/6cfc4fe83ef1a1958e311b34fb86a159782ef2e5","head":{"label":"laimis:recase_fix","ref":"recase_fix","sha":"6cfc4fe83ef1a1958e311b34fb86a159782ef2e5","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"11917175dc905213a642c906d36399a2a99e8bcc","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

this issue while running Lucene.Net.Analysis\\TestGraphTokenizers tests. From time to time an assert would fail at this location:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.TestFramework/Analysis/BaseTokenStreamTestCase.cs#L964\n\nThe idea here is to randomly simulate an exception being thrown when token stream is being iterated. Instead of \"evil exception\" being thrown, the following assert would fail:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.TestFramework/Analysis/MockReaderWrapper.cs#L92\n\nThe underlying problem is the implementation of MockReaderWrapper in C#. It was not exactly a 1-to-1 map to the Java version due to framework differences and bug was introduced in MockReaderWrapper constructor:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.TestFramework/Analysis/MockReaderWrapper.cs#L43\n\nStringReader's ReadToEnd() gets called advancing the iterator to the end. When the actual token stream iteration tries to read the stream, 0 is returned as the underlying text stream has been already iterated by the \"ReadToEnd\" call in the constructor. Furthermore, MockReaderWrapper should override Read() method as to make sure that all the possible ways that the reader is being used are covered (see https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.TestFramework/Analysis/MockTokenizer.cs#L242 how it can call Read with no params).\n\nAlso changed the way MockReader is initialized, instead of new StringReader, text string is passed to it directly. That seemed to make the most sense as there does not appear to be the need to create new stream reader on the same text just to extract that text again.\n\nTestGraphTokenizers still occassionally fail but that appears to be due to another bug that gets invoked radomly and is yet to be determined what is the cause of it. Taking care of this \"evil exception\" branch gets us moving forward in that investigation.\n","created_at":"2014-12-27T16:48:11Z","updated_at":"2014-12-27T19:02:56Z","closed_at":"2014-12-27T17:21:22Z","merged_at":"2014-12-27T17:21:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"aca052bdf8f8bc287e1025a49c28e802b89320a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/29/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/29/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/29/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/6b169565f88b5a776ff12ed460e7fb5d00a5468e","head":{"label":"laimis:MockReaderWrapper_fixes","ref":"MockReaderWrapper_fixes","sha":"6b169565f88b5a776ff12ed460e7fb5d00a5468e","user":{"login":"laimis","id":911757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/911757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis","html_url":"https://github.com/laimis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laimis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2221c6e0e81377c81bbda8f1d43c63e3693960e3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache
