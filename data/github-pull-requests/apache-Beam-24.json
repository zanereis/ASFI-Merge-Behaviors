This can greatly increase the chances that we can use the same provider, and hence same SDK and environment, for adjacent steps.\r\n\r\nThis is done lazily as transforms are used to avoid instanciating all possible providers for all pipelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#30767 \r\n\r\nAs the repository no longer supports junit 4 in favor of junit 5, the `TestPipeline` needed to be updated in order to remove the deprecated `TestRule` in favor of the extension interfaces `BeforeEachCallback` and `AfterEachCallback`. This essentially achieves the same purpose of running code before and after a test statement, but it then required some small tweaks to the code.\r\n\r\nNote: I wasn't sure what error messages to use when checking for values that should almost always be set like the test method, test class, and current element.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[python transform catalog](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/transforms/python/overview/) page is a bit out of date and includes mentions of transforms that don't exist (PAssert, CombineWithContext, View) and outdated notes about transforms that supposedly haven't been implemented (ApproximateUnique, ApproximateQuantiles).\r\n\r\nI've updated the page, removing the unavailable transforms since I'm not sure it's worth mentioning (but I may be missing context) and updated the Approximate* transform entries as well as adding examples for them.\r\n\r\n`BatchElements` also feels like a very useful transform that I've been using personally so I also added it to the catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Example 2 of

playground examples have tons of info logging that drown out any actual logging that the example might've caused. This is somewhat of a big hit to the playground experience (not just noted by me, but by others that I've been introducing to Beam)\r\n\r\nI attempted a fix to change the playground's [log level](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/29948) but that didn't seem to take. Vlado Djerek also tried to figure out where the logging level is set but was also unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a real fix, I just changed or deleted various logging statements that I suspect are probably not all that useful. I suspect especially that the translation prints which really clog up the examples don't offer much useful information.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what running the example looks like right

#30776\r\n\r\nThe core SDK has a hard dependency on `org.everit.json.schema`. Because it was thought of as \"optional\" it was marked `provided`. But `provided` means that the expected runtime will provide a library. It should not be used for \"optional\". Optionality is achieved by factoring logic into separate modules which a user may choose to depend on or not. In this case, the core SDK has a compile time and runtime dependency on this, so this PR fixes this one dependency (among many) to be correct.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

changes just extend `assert_that` to accommodate a couple of common footguns I've seen.\r\n\r\n- `assert_that` will now check to see if you're calling it with a pipeline that has already been run. This catches the following circumstance:\r\n```\r\nwith beam.Pipeline() as p:\r\n    my_pcoll = p | # ...\r\nassert_that(my_pcoll, equal_to([1,2,3]) # should've been indented\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `assert_that` automatically creates a unique label if the label it's given is already taken. Usually when writing unit tests, we don't really need very specific labels for assertions. When this comes up, we usually have to just manually increment every assertion which is quite tedious.","created_at":"2024-03-27T18:23:37Z","updated_at":"2024-09-21T02:23:15Z","closed_at":"2024-09-21T02:23:15Z","merged_at":"2024-09-21T02:23:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"6a095456aa35f5a2623fa58644f44bf36cefa081","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1738121359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzM4MTIxMzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/python","name":"python","color":"e2d35d","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3888027569,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAwi8tc7nvpex","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/Next%20Action:%20Reviewers","name":"Next

[VarInt.java](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/util/VarInt.java#L103) expects ints and longs to be unsigned, however the current [implementation](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/7097443e27c90857258e9478ddb83c9d7e32afce/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/avroio.py#L612) just returns the signed number, which causes an `IOException(\"varint overflow \" + r)` exception to get thrown when using the converted beam schema with a `SqlTransform`\r\n\r\nNOTE: I'm not entirely sure about my logic here, since the resulting `beam.Rows` have the converted 2's complement number will get returned if the user doesn't apply a `SqlTransform` to their pipeline, but the previous implementation was also causing errors, so I'll need some help here\r\n\r\n3) in `avroio.py`'s [beam_value_to_avro_value](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/7097443e27c90857258e9478ddb83c9d7e32afce/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/avroio.py#L702) function, it recurses on `avro_value_to_beam_value`, rather than the `beam_value_to_avro_value` function. I'm 99% sure this should be the other way around, however since the two functions are so similar this previously wasn't causing issues. I only noticed it when I added the custom logic to convert to/from signed and unsigned numbers.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`LockFreeHistogram` and use it in Dataflow's PerWorkerMetrics.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we record histogram metrics in `HistogramData`; however, this class locks the histogram on each metric update/extraction. I assume this is done for historic reasons since `HistogramData` also supports computing arbitrary percentiles on the recorded values and this computation would be inconsistent without locking on reads/writes. For PerWorkerMetrics/BigQueryMetrics we do not need percentiles so we can record metrics in a lock free manner.\r\n\r\nLockFreeHistogram stores the following attributes on the values recorded:\r\n\r\n- Count of number of values recorded in each bucket for recorded values that are in the bucket boundaries.\r\n  - Stored in a [AtomicLongArray](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicLongArray.html)\r\n- Count/Mean of values the values recorded that are below the bucket boundaries (UnderflowStatistics)\r\n  - This is stored in an AtomicReference and updated with  `AtomicReference::compareAndSet` similar to how existing [Distribution metrics](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/45444209c776460ba67ac14a1c33e0775485266a/runners/core-java/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core/metrics/DistributionData.java#L33) are recorded. \r\n- Count/Mean of values the values recorded that are over the bucket boundaries (OverflowStatistic)\r\n  - stored similarly to UnderflowStatistic.\r\n\r\nLockFreeHistogram supports extracting a delta update with the `getSnapshotAndReset` method. The delta update represents values that have been recorded in this histogram since the last time this method was called.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v26.0.0/docs/api/version-history.md\">API version history</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>This release contains a security fix for [CVE-2024-29018], a potential data exfiltration from 'internal' networks via authoritative DNS servers.</p>\n<h3>New</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>Subpath</code> field to the <code>VolumeOptions</code> making it possible to mount a subpath of a volume. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/45687\">moby/moby#45687</a></li>\n<li>Add <code>volume-subpath</code> support to the mount flag (<code>--mount type=volume,...,volume-subpath=&lt;subpath&gt;</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/4331\">docker/cli#4331</a></li>\n<li>Accept <code>=</code> separators and <code>[ipv6]</code> in compose files for <code>docker stack deploy</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/4860\">docker/cli#4860</a></li>\n<li>rootless: Add support for enabling host loopback by setting the <code>DOCKERD_ROOTLESS_ROOTLESSKIT_DISABLE_HOST_LOOPBACK</code> environment variable to <code>false</code> (defaults to <code>true</code>). This lets containers connect to the host by using IP address <code>10.0.2.2</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47352\">moby/moby#47352</a></li>\n<li>containerd image store: <code>docker image ls</code> no longer creates duplicates entries for multi-platform images. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/45967\">moby/moby#45967</a></li>\n<li>containerd image store: Send Prometheus metrics. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47555\">moby/moby#47555</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes and enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[CVE-2024-29018]: Do not forward requests to external DNS servers for a container that is only connected to an 'internal' network.

changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Use <code>SET NAMES charset COLLATE collation</code>. by <a href=\"https://github.com/methane\"><code>@​methane</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/pull/1437\">go-sql-driver/mysql#1437</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Older go-mysql-driver used <code>collation_id</code> in the handshake packet. But it caused collation mismatch in some situation.</li>\n<li>If you don't specify charset nor collation, go-mysql-driver sends <code>SET NAMES utf8mb4</code> for new connection. This uses server's default collation for utf8mb4.</li>\n<li>If you specify charset, go-mysql-driver sends <code>SET NAMES &lt;charset&gt;</code>. This uses the server's default collation for <code>&lt;charset&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li>If you specify collation and/or charset, go-mysql-driver sends <code>SET NAMES charset COLLATE collation</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PathEscape dbname in DSN. by <a href=\"https://github.com/methane\"><code>@​methane</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/pull/1432\">go-sql-driver/mysql#1432</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is backward incompatible in rare case. Check your DSN.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Drop Go 1.13-17 support by <a href=\"https://github.com/methane\"><code>@​methane</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/pull/1420\">go-sql-driver/mysql#1420</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Go 1.18+</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Parse numbers on text protocol too by <a href=\"https://github.com/methane\"><code>@​methane</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/pull/1452\">go-sql-driver/mysql#1452</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When text protocol is used, go-mysql-driver passed bare <code>[]byte</code> to database/sql for avoid unnecessary allocation and conversion.</li>\n<li>If user specified <code>*any</code> to <code>Scan()</code>, database/sql passed the <code>[]byte</code> into the target variabe.</li>\n<li>This confused users because most user doesn't know when text/binary protocol used.</li>\n<li>go-mysql-driver 1.8 converts integer/float values into int64/double even in text protocol. This doesn't increase allocation compared to <code>[]byte</code> and conversion cost is negilible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New options start using the Functional Option Pattern to avoid increasing technical debt in the Config object.

\r\nThis is a proof-of-concept draft for fixing/implementing deferred side inputs with Combiners. I could use feedback on how to proceed and then I'll clean it up as well.\r\n\r\n**Issue:**\r\nCurrently if you try to use a side input with a combine function, you end up with a traceback during the pipeline translation step:\r\n```\r\n  File \"/Users/jtran/builds/2024-2/build/internal/lib/python3.11/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/portability/fn_api_runner/translations.py\", line 1367, in lift_combiners\r\n    expansion = lifted_stages if can_lift(transform) else unlifted_stages\r\n                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/jtran/builds/2024-2/build/internal/lib/python3.11/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/portability/fn_api_runner/translations.py\", line 1239, in can_lift\r\n    context.components.pcollections[only_element(\r\n                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/jtran/builds/2024-2/build/internal/lib/python3.11/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/portability/fn_api_runner/translations.py\", line 2082, in only_element\r\n    element, = iterable\r\n    ^^^^^^^^\r\nValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 1)\r\n```\r\n**Fix?:**\r\nThe issue is because in the code where we determine whether or not to lift a combiner, we assume the combiner has a single input pcoll, which is not true when the combiner has a deferred side input.\r\n\r\nI went through fixing this and then realized that we also don't have plumbing for deferred side inputs implemented at the `operations.py` layer either. It seemed like a lot of work to duplicate all the side input plumbing that ParDo has when the phases of the combiners can be expressed as ParDos anyways.\r\n\r\nInside of `direct/helper_transforms.py` we actually already define a ParDo-based version of a lifted combiner. I tried adding an override to use it only if we have a combiner with side inputs but at that point we've already substituted away the side input for a `ArgumentPlaceholder`s. I instead updated it and returned it in `CombinePerKey.__new__`. I couldn't put it in `CombinePerKey.expand` since `CombinePerKey` has the special urn that would've resulted in the subtransforms getting ignored\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-26T03:39:28Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T12:41:51Z","closed_at":"2024-06-05T12:41:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebb8e65f69726ad5abf54a31a905cf8c83c62f6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tvalentyn","id":9408864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDg4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9408864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn","html_url":"https://github.com/tvalentyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1738121359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzM4MTIxMzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/python","name":"python","color":"e2d35d","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/30743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/30743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/30743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/117a182972e9f08e4f14d2ae2ca9730437b7018e","head":{"label":"hjtran:combine_sideinputs","ref":"combine_sideinputs","sha":"117a182972e9f08e4f14d2ae2ca9730437b7018e","user":{"login":"hjtran","id":10524948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI0OTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10524948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran","html_url":"https://github.com/hjtran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":674288137,"node_id":"R_kgDOKDDSCQ","name":"beam","full_name":"hjtran/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hjtran","id":10524948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI0OTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10524948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran","html_url":"https://github.com/hjtran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjtran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hjtran/beam","description":"Apache

href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.7.0</h2>\n<p>Welcome to <strong>wazero 1.7</strong>: the release that upgrades like a minor, but feels like a major!</p>\n<p>It's finally time for the long-awaited, <strong>final release</strong> of our brand new <strong>optimizing compiler</strong>. This is such a big deal that we are celebrating it at [Wasm I/O 2024][wasmio] with another round of wonderful lightning talks from wazero users [like we did in 2023][wazero1]. In fact, even this release is being tagged during the event! Stay tuned on our usual channels to see the recording:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the [#wazero hashtag on Twitter][twitter]</li>\n<li>Join the [#wazero channel on the Gophers Slack][gophers]</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>wazero optimizes machine code compiled from wasm</h2>\n<p>Translating Wasm bytecode into machine code can take multiple forms. An optimizing compiler performs multiple nontrivial transformations on the input code, ultimately producing more efficient (&quot;optimized&quot;) code.</p>\n<p>In 1.7 we replaced our internal wasm compiler with an optimizing one. This means it is a drop-in: you don’t need to do anything to use it. If interested in compiler design, please read [the docs][wazevo-docs], contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a>.</p>\n<p>As for performance improvements, we have come to expect a run-time boost ranging from 10% to even 60%, with 30-40% being the average. Notably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a>' fork of [coremark][coremark] shows an improved score of 15265 vs 9591, i.e. about +60% on arm64 (Apple M1 Pro)</li>\n<li>[mercari/grpc-federation][mercari] improvements between 4-10% on their Wasm extensions to the [Common Extension Language][cel]</li>\n<li>[kubernetes-sigs/kube-scheduler-wasm-extension][k8s-sched] sees an average of &gt;40% decrease on schedule lifecycle overhead</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> [contributed some numbers][achille-slack] on the Go standard library (<code>GOOS=wasip1</code>) showing at least 30% improvements on the <code>syscall</code>, <code>compress/flate</code> (gzip) and <code>encoding/json</code> packages, with peaks of 60% (especially in data throughput).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While a major improvement, we decided against calling this version 2.0. If we did, we would cause library dependency lockups due to go imports needing a ‘/v2’. We take backwards compatibility seriously, so couldn’t do that to you!</p>\n<p>As usual, <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> owns the lionshare of the contributions, with <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> helping along the way, especially on the new <code>amd64</code> backend. Notably, <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> also contributed a performance improvement to the compiler (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2026\">#2026</a>) and <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> helped in many ways with testing and verifying the implementation, validating (among other things) against his library [go-sqlite3][go-sqlite3].</p>\n<p>Note: an optimizing compiler does more work, so it takes longer. Production use of wazero should always compile wasm during initialization to avoid slowing down function runtime.</p>\n<h2>Experimental: Wasm Threads Spec</h2>\n<p>The Wasm Threads spec introduces instructions to explicitly share memory between modules, and new operations for atomic memory access. Compilers may use this feature for concurrent threads of execution. For instance <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a>’s [Go ports of protoc plugins][protoc] needed atomic instruction support to compile to Wasm.</p>\n<p>1.7 concludes a long journey started with <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a>'s first PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1899\">#1899</a>  and continued with <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> occasionally tag-teaming, especially to support in the new compiler; <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> assisted with reviewing.</p>\n<p>You can enable Wasm Threads support by setting the corresponding flag:</p>\n<pre lang=\"go\"><code>     // Threads support must be enabled explicitly in addition to standard V2 features.\n     cfg := wazero.NewRuntimeConfig().\n           WithCoreFeatures(api.CoreFeaturesV2 | experimental.CoreFeaturesThreads)\n</code></pre>\n<p>For a usage example see <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/blob/v1.7.0/experimental/features_example_test.go\">features_example_test.go</a></p>\n<h2>Experimental: Snapshot/Restore</h2>\n<p>The Snapshot/Restore experimental feature saves the state of a wasm function and restores it later. This feature has been contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> to implement exception handling in [wasilibs/go-pgquery][go-pgquery]</p>\n<p>You can enable snapshot/restore by setting the context flag:</p>\n<pre lang=\"go\"><code>&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

#30730 \r\nfixes #30729 \r\n\r\nAn integration test called `BigQueryIOStorageReadIT.testBigQueryStorageReadProjectionPushdown` is failing - this is because the pushdown optimizer projects the record retrieved from the bigquery by removing unused `string_field`. Later the `toBeamRow` conversion method iterates through the beam schema's fields and tries to extract a value from the avro record for every such field, including the one that has been removed by the optimizer - avro version 1.8 didn't have a problem with attempting to get a value from non-existent field - it simply returned `null`, but things have changed in version 1.11, and now this operation throws an exception. The fix is to check whether the field exists in the record before attempting to fetch its value. Also - added a unit test specifically for this situation\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`Histogram::update(double... values) ` method.\r\n\r\nBy default this method repeatedly calls `Histogram::update(double value)`.\r\n\r\nThis is a minor optimization for recording histogram metrics in `StreamingInsertsMetrics` since we are recording multiple values at once. Currently, each call to `latencyHistogram.update(latency.toMillis())` has to do a map lookup in the underlying DelegatingHistogram.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#30690 fixed [beam_PostRelease_NightlySnapshot](https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/workflows/beam_PostRelease_NightlySnapshot.yml)\r\nas shown in [latest run](https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/8378389784).\r\nHowever, some Google Cloud Storage paths contained `null`. For example:\r\n`gs://temp-storage-for-release-validation-tests/nightly-snapshot-validation/java-userscore-result-dataflow-runner/null/output`.\r\nIt still worked because the test run that had a valid UUID was still different than \"null\".\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the same unique test ID strategy for Google Cloud Storage object path uniqueness to the Dataflow BOM tests. (It was missed in the previous PR #30690)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

on [autovalue's documentation](https://github.com/google/auto/blob/main/value/userguide/howto.md#-memoize-cache-derived-properties). \r\n\r\nFor `ExponentialBuckets`, the `Base`, `InvLog2GrowthFactor`, and `RangeTo` are all derived from the input arguments `NumBuckets` and `Scale`. Currently these three values are computed for every instance of ExponentialHistogram, and they are used in the `hashCode` and `equalsTo` method for this class.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the derived values will only be computed if an instance needs them, but derived values will only be computed once. Additionally, the derived values will not be used in the `equalsTo` or `hashCode` method making these methods more efficient. \r\n\r\nThis PR also memoizes the `hashCode` of `ExponentialBuckets`, which is helpful because we compute this every time we record a histogram value. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
