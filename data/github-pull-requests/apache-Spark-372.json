Problem\n\nCurrently in `StreamExecution`, [we first run the batch, then construct the next](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamExecution.scala#L165):\n\n``` scala\nif (dataAvailable) runBatch()\nconstructNextBatch()\n```\n\nThis is good when we run batches ASAP, where data would get processed in the **very next batch**:\n\n![1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15843379/14779964/2786e698-0b0d-11e6-9d2c-bb41513488b2.png)\n\nHowever, when we run batches at trigger like `ProcessTime(\"1 minute\")`, data - such as _y_ below - may not get processed in the very next batch i.e. _batch 1_, but in _batch 2_:\n\n![2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15843379/14779818/6f3bb064-0b0c-11e6-9f16-c1ce4897186b.png)\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch reverses the order of `constructNextBatch()` and `runBatch()`. After this patch, data would get processed in the **very next batch**, i.e. _batch 1_:\n\n![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15843379/14779816/6f36ee62-0b0c-11e6-9e53-bc8397fade18.png)\n\nIn addition, this patch alters when we do `currentBatchId += 1`: let's do that when the processing of the current batch's data is completed, so we won't bother passing `currentBatchId + 1` or  `currentBatchId - 1` to states or sinks.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew added test case. Also this should be covered by existing test suits, e.g. stress tests and

PR is the branch-1.6 version of the following commits from @JoshRosen. We probably cannot change the dependency of sql/hive again. But, if anyone needs this, they can use this PR.\n\n**[SPARK-14783] Preserve full exception stacktrace in IsolatedClientLoader**\nIn IsolatedClientLoader, we have a`catch` block which throws an exception without wrapping the original exception, causing the full exception stacktrace and any nested exceptions to be lost. This patch fixes this, improving the usefulness of classloading error messages.\n\n**[SPARK-14786] Remove hive-cli dependency from hive subproject**\nThe `hive` subproject currently depends on `hive-cli` in order to perform a check to see whether a `SessionState` is an instance of `org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.CliSessionState` (see #9589). The introduction of this `hive-cli` dependency has caused problems for users whose Hive metastore JAR classpaths don't include the `hive-cli` classes (such as in #11495).\n\nThis patch removes this dependency on `hive-cli` and replaces the `isInstanceOf` check by reflection. I added a Maven Enforcer rule to ban `hive-cli` from the `hive` subproject in order to make sure that this dependency is not accidentally

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe previous subquery PRs did not include support for pushing subqueries used in filters (`WHERE`/`HAVING`) down. This PR adds this support. For example :\n\n``` scala\nrange(0, 10).registerTempTable(\"a\")\nrange(5, 15).registerTempTable(\"b\")\nrange(7, 25).registerTempTable(\"c\")\nrange(3, 12).registerTempTable(\"d\")\nval plan = sql(\"select * from a join b on a.id = b.id left join c on c.id = b.id where a.id in (select id from d)\")\nplan.explain(true)\n```\n\nLeads to the following Analyzed & Optimized plans:\n\n```\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\n...\n\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\nid: bigint, id: bigint, id: bigint\nProject [id#0L,id#4L,id#8L]\n+- Filter predicate-subquery#16 [(id#0L = id#12L)]\n   :  +- SubqueryAlias predicate-subquery#16 [(id#0L = id#12L)]\n   :     +- Project [id#12L]\n   :        +- SubqueryAlias d\n   :           +- Range 3, 12, 1, 8, [id#12L]\n   +- Join LeftOuter, Some((id#8L = id#4L))\n      :- Join Inner, Some((id#0L = id#4L))\n      :  :- SubqueryAlias a\n      :  :  +- Range 0, 10, 1, 8, [id#0L]\n      :  +- SubqueryAlias b\n      :     +- Range 5, 15, 1, 8, [id#4L]\n      +- SubqueryAlias c\n         +- Range 7, 25, 1, 8, [id#8L]\n\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nJoin LeftOuter, Some((id#8L = id#4L))\n:- Join Inner, Some((id#0L = id#4L))\n:  :- Join LeftSemi, Some((id#0L = id#12L))\n:  :  :- Range 0, 10, 1, 8, [id#0L]\n:  :  +- Range 3, 12, 1, 8, [id#12L]\n:  +- Range 5, 15, 1, 8, [id#4L]\n+- Range 7, 25, 1, 8, [id#8L]\n\n== Physical Plan ==\n...\n```\n\nI have also taken the opportunity to move quite a bit of code around:\n- Rewriting subqueris and pulling out correlated predicated from subqueries has been moved into the analyzer. The analyzer transforms `Exists` and `InSubQuery` into `PredicateSubquery` expressions. A PredicateSubquery exposes the 'join' expressions and the proper references. This makes things like type coercion, optimization and planning easier to do.\n- I have added support for `Aggregate` plans in subqueries. Any correlated expressions will be added to the grouping expressions. I have removed support for `Union` plans, since pulling in an outer reference from beneath a Union has no value (a filtered value could easily be part of another Union child).\n- Resolution of subqueries is now done using `OuterReference`s. These are used to wrap any outer reference; this makes the identification of these references easier, and also makes dealing with duplicate attributes in the outer and inner plans easier. The resolution of subqueries initially used a resolution loop which would alternate between calling the analyzer and trying to resolve the outer references. We now use a dedicated analyzer which uses a special rule for outer reference resolution.\n\nThese changes are a stepping stone for enabling correlated scalar subqueries, enabling all Hive tests & allowing us to use predicate subqueries anywhere.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nCurrent tests and added test cases in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR aims to add new **FoldablePropagation** optimizer that propagates foldable expressions by replacing all attributes with the aliases of original foldable expression. Other optimizations will take advantage of the propagated foldable expressions: e.g. `EliminateSorts` optimizer now can handle the following Case 2 and 3. (Case 1 is the previous implementation.)\n1. Literals and foldable expression, e.g. \"ORDER BY 1.0, 'abc', Now()\"\n2. Foldable ordinals, e.g. \"SELECT 1.0, 'abc', Now() ORDER BY 1, 2, 3\"\n3. Foldable aliases, e.g. \"SELECT 1.0 x, 'abc' y, Now() z ORDER BY x, y, z\"\n\nThis PR has been generalized based on @cloud-fan 's key ideas many times; he should be credited for the work he did.\n\n**Before**\n\n```\nscala> sql(\"SELECT 1.0, Now() x ORDER BY 1, x\").explain\n== Physical Plan ==\nWholeStageCodegen\n:  +- Sort [1.0#5 ASC,x#0 ASC], true, 0\n:     +- INPUT\n+- Exchange

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n#### Symptom\n\n If a table is created as parquet or ORC table with hive syntaxt DDL, such as\n\n``` SQL\ncreate table t1 (c1 int, c2 string) stored as parquet\n```\n\nThe following command will fail\n\n``` SQL\ncreate view v1 as select * from t1\n```\n#### Root Cause\n\nCurrently, `HiveMetaStoreCatalog` converts Paruqet/Orc tables to `LogicalRelation` without giving any `tableIdentifier`. `SQLBuilder` expects the `LogicalRelation` to have an associated `tableIdentifier`. However, the `LogicalRelation` created earlier does not have such a `tableIdentifier`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nReplace com.sun.jersey with org.glassfish.jersey. Changes to the Spark Web UI code were required to compile. The changes were relatively standard Jersey migration things.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI did a manual test for the standalone web APIs. Although I didn't test the functionality of the security filter itself, the code that changed non-trivially is how we actually register the filter. I attached a debugger to the Spark master and verified that the SecurityFilter code is indeed invoked upon hitting

is prone to a race condition: if one thread calls `stop()` right as a checkpoint write task begins to execute, that write task may become blocked when trying to access `fs`, the shared Hadoop FileSystem, since both the `fs` getter and `stop` method synchronize on the same lock. Here's a thread-dump excerpt which illustrates the problem:\n\n``` java\n\"pool-31-thread-1\" #156 prio=5 os_prio=31 tid=0x00007fea02cd2000 nid=0x5c0b waiting for monitor entry [0x000000013bc4c000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on object monitor)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.CheckpointWriter.org$apache$spark$streaming$CheckpointWriter$$fs(Checkpoint.scala:302)\n    - waiting to lock <0x00000007bf53ee78> (a org.apache.spark.streaming.CheckpointWriter)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.CheckpointWriter$CheckpointWriteHandler.run(Checkpoint.scala:224)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n\n\"pool-1-thread-1-ScalaTest-running-MapWithStateSuite\" #11 prio=5 os_prio=31 tid=0x00007fe9ff879800 nid=0x5703 waiting on condition [0x000000012e54c000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (parking)\n    at sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\n    - parking to wait for  <0x00000007bf564568> (a java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject)\n    at java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanos(LockSupport.java:215)\n    at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject.awaitNanos(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:2078)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.awaitTermination(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1465)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.CheckpointWriter.stop(Checkpoint.scala:291)\n    - locked <0x00000007bf53ee78> (a org.apache.spark.streaming.CheckpointWriter)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobGenerator.stop(JobGenerator.scala:159)\n    - locked <0x00000007bf53ea90> (a org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobGenerator)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobScheduler.stop(JobScheduler.scala:115)\n    - locked <0x00000007bf53d3f0> (a org.apache.spark.streaming.scheduler.JobScheduler)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext$$anonfun$stop$1.apply$mcV$sp(StreamingContext.scala:680)\n    at org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.tryLogNonFatalError(Utils.scala:1219)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext.stop(StreamingContext.scala:679)\n    - locked <0x00000007bf516a70> (a org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext.stop(StreamingContext.scala:644)\n    - locked <0x00000007bf516a70> (a org.apache.spark.streaming.StreamingContext)\n[...]\n```\n\nWe can fix this problem by having `stop` and `fs` be synchronized on different locks: the synchronization on `stop` only needs to guard against multiple threads calling `stop` at the same time, whereas the synchronization on `fs` is only necessary for cross-thread visibility. There's only ever a single active checkpoint writer thread at a time, so we don't need to guard against concurrent access to `fs`. Thus, `fs` can simply become a `@volatile` var, similar to `lastCheckpointTime`.\n\nThis change should fix [SPARK-13693](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13693), a flaky `MapWithStateSuite` test suite which has recently been failing several times per day. It also results in a huge test speedup: prior to this patch, `MapWithStateSuite` took about 80 seconds to run, whereas it now runs in less than 10 seconds. For the `streaming` project's tests as a whole, they now run in ~220 seconds vs. ~354 before.\n\n/cc @zsxwing and @tdas for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere have been continuing requests (e.g., SPARK-7131) for allowing users to extend and modify MLlib models and algorithms.\n\nThis PR makes tree and ensemble classes, Node types, and Split types in spark.ml no longer final.  This matches most other spark.ml algorithms.\n\nConstructors for models are still private since we may need to refactor how stats are maintained in tree nodes.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests\n","created_at":"2016-04-26T20:08:37Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T17:29:06Z","closed_at":"2016-04-26T21:46:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a17817120985897cd970d3d54f47227e5ca48bcb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12711/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12711/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12711/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c328e953b7d7199e68bb0fc6c28fdc8f94bcad95","head":{"label":"jkbradley:final-trees","ref":"final-trees","sha":"c328e953b7d7199e68bb0fc6c28fdc8f94bcad95","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhile the vectorized hash map in `TungstenAggregate` is currently supported for all primitive data types during partial aggregation, this patch only enables the hash map for a subset of cases that've been verified to show performance improvements on our benchmarks subject to an internal conf that sets an upper limit on the maximum length of the aggregate key/value schema. This list of supported use-cases should be expanded over time.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is no new change in functionality so existing tests should suffice. Performance tests were done on TPCDS benchmarks.\n","created_at":"2016-04-26T20:08:16Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T22:10:04Z","closed_at":"2016-04-26T21:53:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1adc5903664e7b356ffad347ede93b3acef733da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12710/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12710/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12710/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3c0ff5427810353763479e6e41d7d9167e4a98e5","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:vectorized-enable","ref":"vectorized-enable","sha":"3c0ff5427810353763479e6e41d7d9167e4a98e5","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds two major methods to Row, `attempt` and `getOption`. The former returns a `Try` while the latter returns an `Option`. The end use case for both `attempt` and `getOption` is to get values out of a row object without throwing an exception. However, in one of my previous PRs, #10247 (which didn't have an `attempt` method), it was pointed out by @marmbrus that the `getOption` method caught exceptions and converted them to `None`s. His point of view was that exceptions should not be automatically handled internally as that hid important information. But since the whole reason of `getOption` was to _not_ throw exceptions, I introduced the `attempt` method which returns `Success` and `Failure` objects, which do not lose information and `getOption`, which does and returns a `Some` or `None` but loses the information.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI've written extensive unit tests to test the features. The tests testing for `ClassCastException` do not pass though looking at the code, I cannot tell why. Would appreciate some feedback if anyone has insights. Also I think `attempt` might not be the best method name. So I am open to suggestions. Also, I am closing PR #12587 and creating this because it was pointing to `master` and not inconvenient to work

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the past, genjavadoc had issues with package private members which led the spark project to use a forked version. This issue has been fixed upstream (typesafehub/genjavadoc#70) and a release is available for scala versions 2.10, 2.11 **and 2.12**, hence a forked version for spark is no longer necessary.\nThis pull request updates the build configuration to use the newest upstream genjavadoc.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe build was run `sbt unidoc`. During the process javadoc emits some errors on the generated java stubs, however these errors were also present before the upgrade. Furthermore, the produced html is fine.\n","created_at":"2016-04-26T18:57:15Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T16:58:37Z","closed_at":"2016-04-29T09:12:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a6ff9bd99e588800a5f90c9b2af4b4a27b3fab2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12707/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12707/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12707/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f7d649c47d0d6f082b5a6237e4b60e8bd8cf3716","head":{"label":"jodersky:SPARK-14511-genjavadoc","ref":"SPARK-14511-genjavadoc","sha":"f7d649c47d0d6f082b5a6237e4b60e8bd8cf3716","user":{"login":"jodersky","id":1007012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDcwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky","html_url":"https://github.com/jodersky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"302a18686998b8b96546526bfccec9cf5b667386","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

removing the \"native\" hashAlgorithm option in spark.ml and pyspark.ml.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn PySpark, the invalid join type will not throw error for the following join:\n`df1.join(df2, how='not-a-valid-join-type')`\n\nThe signature of the join is:\n`def join(self, other, on=None, how=None):`\nThe existing code completely ignores the `how` parameter when `on` is `None`. This patch will process the arguments passed to join and pass in to JVM Spark SQL Analyzer, which will validate the join type passed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUsed manual and existing test suites.\n","created_at":"2016-04-26T07:13:11Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T00:10:40Z","closed_at":"2016-10-10T00:10:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6f8feacfe59f02f49a44ff36c0132dceb177f16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/700073f49030795f3edf73ba07951765e2064ca2","head":{"label":"bkpathak:spark-14761","ref":"spark-14761","sha":"700073f49030795f3edf73ba07951765e2064ca2","user":{"login":"bkpathak","id":3136407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzY0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3136407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak","html_url":"https://github.com/bkpathak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":57094066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzA5NDA2Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"bkpathak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bkpathak","id":3136407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzY0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3136407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak","html_url":"https://github.com/bkpathak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bkpathak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe currently expose both Hadoop configuration and Spark SQL configuration in RuntimeConfig. I think we can remove the Hadoop configuration part, and simply generate Hadoop Configuration on the fly by passing all the SQL configurations into it. This way, there is a single interface (in Java/Scala/Python/SQL) for end-users.\n\nAs part of this patch, I also removed some config options deprecated in Spark 1.x.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUpdated relevant tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-26T06:49:59Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T21:53:17Z","closed_at":"2016-04-27T05:04:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a6ba079aa71355cfd24aa773c271af0889a54b56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/55a3676e7f10997af97168d714750c3f104a090f","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14913","ref":"SPARK-14913","sha":"55a3676e7f10997af97168d714750c3f104a090f","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe currently have no way for users to propagate options to the underlying library that rely in Hadoop configurations to work. For example, there are various options in parquet-mr that users might want to set, but the data source API does not expose a per-job way to set it. This patch propagates the user-specified options also into Hadoop Configuration.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUsed a mock data source implementation to test both the read path and the write path.\n","created_at":"2016-04-26T05:32:00Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T18:02:40Z","closed_at":"2016-04-26T18:00:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d09645e0cc7b8b71dd4387074c98c62621ddebed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12688/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12688/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12688/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5c5e6a687017196b0ce54b4e14087a878f691f2b","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14912","ref":"SPARK-14912","sha":"5c5e6a687017196b0ce54b4e14087a878f691f2b","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

array](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/37bc203c8dd5022cb11d53b697c28a737ee85bcc) introduced an `acquiredButNotUsed` field, but it might not be correctly synchronized:\n- the write `acquiredButNotUsed += acquired` is guarded by `this` lock (see [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blame/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/memory/TaskMemoryManager.java#L271));\n- the read `memoryManager.releaseExecutionMemory(acquiredButNotUsed, taskAttemptId, tungstenMemoryMode)` (see

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe existing `Describe Function` only support the function name in `identifier`. This is different from what Hive behaves. That is why many test cases `udf_abc` in `HiveCompatibilitySuite` are not using our native DDL support. For example, \n- udf_not.q\n- udf_bitwise_not.q\n\nThis PR is to resolve the issues. Now, we can support the command of `Describe Function` whose function names are in the following format:\n- `qualifiedName` (e.g., `db.func1`)\n- `STRING` (e.g., `'func1'`)\n- `comparisonOperator` (e.g,. `<`)\n- `arithmeticOperator` (e.g., `+`)\n- `predicateOperator` (e.g., `or`)\n\nNote, before this PR, we only have a native command support when the function name is in the format of `qualifiedName`.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases in `DDLSuite.scala`. Also manually verified all the related test cases in `HiveCompatibilitySuite` passed.\n","created_at":"2016-04-26T02:04:24Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T17:54:21Z","closed_at":"2016-04-26T17:31:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6487e41dba45ad7ab63cd13b652e6b75f9f768ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12679/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12679/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12679/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f42b41bab0c5cc9a26080fe1d85bc0584c806bd6","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:descFunction","ref":"descFunction","sha":"f42b41bab0c5cc9a26080fe1d85bc0584c806bd6","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

main goal behind these changes are provide support to use HDFS resources for \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\", when Hadoop/YARN deployments used.\n This can be helpful when you want to use custom SparkSerializer implementation (our project case).\n\nHow it works with these changes:\n1. Value of \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\" splits by comma\n2. Iterate over all paths and filter those which started with \"hdfs;//\"\n3. Generate link for each path and add LocalResource to executor launch context local resources\n4. Add generated links to executor CLASSPATH\n5. NodeManager loads the specified local resources to application cache\n\nAfter that, you do not need deploy extra resources to each Hadoop node manually, it will be automatically.\n\nThe changes fully backward compatible and does not break any existing \"spark.executor.extraClassPath\" usages.\n\nThis patch was tested manually on our Hadoop cluster (4-nodes).\n","created_at":"2016-04-26T01:25:47Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T01:18:27Z","closed_at":"2016-04-28T01:18:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a9f3888ba18c68d7ad8fb0d3c4b2eb711e677c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a4f1c10a3f0f10b9f18ca61e599f50a1e17ba8bd","head":{"label":"mikhaildubkov:master","ref":"master","sha":"a4f1c10a3f0f10b9f18ca61e599f50a1e17ba8bd","user":{"login":"mikhaildubkov","id":4924409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjQ0MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4924409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov","html_url":"https://github.com/mikhaildubkov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikhaildubkov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c71c6853fcecd3b41de0e8273329ea83a9779320","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds Python APIs for:\n- `ContinuousQueryManager`\n- `ContinuousQueryException`\n\nThe `ContinuousQueryException` is a very basic wrapper, it doesn't provide the functionality that the Scala side provides, but it follows the same pattern for `AnalysisException`.\n\nFor `ContinuousQueryManager`, all APIs are provided except for registering listeners.\n\nThis PR also attempts to fix test flakiness by stopping all active streams just before tests.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPython Doc tests and unit tests\n","created_at":"2016-04-25T23:07:21Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:54:57Z","closed_at":"2016-04-28T22:24:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d3ab32b6669e90cfa07860cb0391a40a887a95c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/37da1e1c0b8eab930b316646528104719162ec3b","head":{"label":"brkyvz:pyspark-cqm","ref":"pyspark-cqm","sha":"37da1e1c0b8eab930b316646528104719162ec3b","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUpdated Classifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GBTClassifier to not require input column metadata.\n- They first check for metadata.\n- If numClasses is not specified in metadata, they identify the largest label value (up to a limit).\n\nThis functionality is implemented in a new Classifier.getNumClasses method.\n\nAlso\n- Updated Classifier.extractLabeledPoints to (a) check label values and (b) include a second version which takes a numClasses value for validity checking.\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Unit tests in ClassifierSuite for helper methods\n- Unit tests for DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GBTClassifier with toy datasets lacking label metadata\n","created_at":"2016-04-25T17:42:09Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T19:51:55Z","closed_at":"2016-04-28T23:21:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"464b276fcf1fd3e1eb95fe14a175ed3974a4f29c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a3653c7e3a8abc25dda2eb1a09619b2ae5a3781a","head":{"label":"jkbradley:trees-no-metadata","ref":"trees-no-metadata","sha":"a3653c7e3a8abc25dda2eb1a09619b2ae5a3781a","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`DAGScheduler`sometimes generate incorrect stage graph.\n\nSuppose you have the following DAG:\n\n```\n[A] <--(s_A)-- [B] <--(s_B)-- [C] <--(s_C)-- [D]\n            \\                /\n              <-------------\n```\n\nNote: [] means an RDD, () means a shuffle dependency.\n\nHere, RDD `B` has a shuffle dependency on RDD `A`, and RDD `C` has shuffle dependency on both `B` and `A`. The shuffle dependency IDs are numbers in the `DAGScheduler`, but to make the example easier to understand, let's call the shuffled data from `A` shuffle dependency ID `s_A` and the shuffled data from `B` shuffle dependency ID `s_B`.\nThe `getAncestorShuffleDependencies` method in `DAGScheduler` (incorrectly) does not check for duplicates when it's adding ShuffleDependencies to the parents data structure, so for this DAG, when `getAncestorShuffleDependencies` gets called on `C` (previous of the final RDD), `getAncestorShuffleDependencies` will return `s_A`, `s_B`, `s_A` (`s_A` gets added twice: once when the method \"visit\"s RDD `C`, and once when the method \"visit\"s RDD `B`). This is problematic because this line of code: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8ef3399/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L289 then generates a new shuffle stage for each dependency returned by `getAncestorShuffleDependencies`, resulting in duplicate map stages that compute the map output from RDD `A`.\n\nAs a result, `DAGScheduler` generates the following stages and their parents for each shuffle:\n\n|  | stage | parents |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| s_A | ShuffleMapStage 2 | List() |\n| s_B | ShuffleMapStage 1 | List(ShuffleMapStage 0) |\n| s_C | ShuffleMapStage 3 | List(ShuffleMapStage 1, ShuffleMapStage 2) |\n| - | ResultStage 4 | List(ShuffleMapStage 3) |\n\nThe stage for s_A should be `ShuffleMapStage 0`, but the stage for `s_A` is generated twice as `ShuffleMapStage 2` and `ShuffleMapStage 0` is overwritten by `ShuffleMapStage 2`, and the stage `ShuffleMap Stage1` keeps referring the old stage `ShuffleMapStage 0`.\n\nThis patch is fixing it.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI added the sample RDD graph to show the illegal stage graph to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRight now, the data type field of a CatalogColumn is using the string representation. When we create this string from a DataType object, there are places where we use simpleString instead of catalogString. Although catalogString is the same as simpleString right now, it is still good to use catalogString. So, we will not silently introduce issues when we change the semantic of simpleString or the implementation of catalogString.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis issue aims to fix some errors in R examples and make them up-to-date in docs and example modules.\n- Remove the wrong usage of `map`. We need to use `lapply` in `sparkR` if needed. However, `lapply` is private so far. The corrected example will be added later.\n- Fix the wrong example in Section `Generic Load/Save Functions` of `docs/sql-programming-guide.md` for consistency\n- Fix datatypes in `sparkr.md`.\n- Update a data result in `sparkr.md`.\n- Replace deprecated functions to remove warnings: jsonFile -> read.json, parquetFile -> read.parquet\n- Use up-to-date R-like functions: loadDF -> read.df, saveDF -> write.df, saveAsParquetFile -> write.parquet\n- Replace `SparkR DataFrame` with `SparkDataFrame` in `dataframe.R` and `data-manipulation.R`.\n- Other minor syntax fixes and a typo.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual.\n","created_at":"2016-04-24T06:51:02Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T00:59:59Z","closed_at":"2016-04-25T05:12:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94c0580af7bbbf016907303f0688383fc345ff56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12649/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12649/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12649/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47aa57ef1d6533ef5c5161fd2caf7c1ed3ff5818","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-14883","ref":"SPARK-14883","sha":"47aa57ef1d6533ef5c5161fd2caf7c1ed3ff5818","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"35319d326488b3bf9235dfcf9ac4533ce846f21f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the TRIM function support in Spark SQL by allowing the specification\r\nof trim characters set. Below is the SQL syntax :\r\n\r\n``` SQL\r\n<trim function> ::= TRIM <left paren> <trim operands> <right paren>\r\n<trim operands> ::= [ [ <trim specification> ] [ <trim character set> ] FROM ] <trim source>\r\n<trim source> ::= <character value expression>\r\n<trim specification> ::=\r\n  LEADING\r\n| TRAILING\r\n| BOTH\r\n<trim character set> ::= <characters value expression>    \r\n```\r\nor \r\n``` SQL\r\nLTRIM (source-exp [, trim-exp])\r\nRTRIM (source-exp [, trim-exp])\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the documentation link of support of this feature by other mainstream databases.\r\n- **Oracle:** [TRIM function](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/olap.111/b28126/dml_functions_2126.htm#OLADM704)\r\n- **DB2:** [TRIM scalar function](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMKHH_10.0.0/com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/ak05270_.htm)\r\n- **MySQL:** [Trim function](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html#function_trim)\r\n- **Oracle:** [ltrim](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/olap.111/b28126/dml_functions_2018.htm#OLADM594)\r\n- **DB2:** [ltrim](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPEK_11.0.0/sqlref/src/tpc/db2z_bif_ltrim.html) \r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is to implement the above enhancement. In the implementation, the design principle is to keep the changes to the minimum. Also, the exiting trim functions (which handles a special case, i.e., trimming space characters) are kept unchanged for performane reasons. \r\n#### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe unit test cases are added in the following files:\r\n- UTF8StringSuite.java\r\n- StringExpressionsSuite.scala\r\n- sql/SQLQuerySuite.scala\r\n- StringFunctionsSuite.scala\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-04-23T23:32:59Z","updated_at":"2017-09-18T22:21:38Z","closed_at":"2017-09-18T19:15:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d031969f91a95fddb67680c2cd55ab48ed695fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12646/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12646/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12646/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/79846bfd86c6265ebe7d14906853bfe2ec0467f3","head":{"label":"kevinyu98:spark-14878","ref":"spark-14878","sha":"79846bfd86c6265ebe7d14906853bfe2ec0467f3","user":{"login":"kevinyu98","id":7550280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTAyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7550280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38393679,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM5MzY3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kevinyu98/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinyu98","id":7550280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTAyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7550280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWith the addition of ExternalClusterManager(ECM) interface in PR #11723, any cluster manager can now be integrated with Spark. It was suggested in  ExternalClusterManager PR that one of the existing cluster managers should start using the new interface to ensure that the API is correct. Ideally, all the existing cluster managers should eventually use the ECM interface but as a first step yarn will now use the ECM interface. This PR refactors YARN code from SparkContext.createTaskScheduler function  into YarnClusterManager that implements ECM interface. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nSince this is refactoring, no new tests has been added.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch improves error handling in view creation. CreateViewCommand itself will analyze the view SQL query first, and if it cannot successfully analyze it, throw an AnalysisException.\n\nIn addition, I also added the following two conservative guards for easier identification of Spark bugs:\n1. If there is a bug and the generated view SQL cannot be analyzed, throw an exception at runtime. Note that this is not an AnalysisException because it is not caused by the user and more likely indicate a bug in Spark.\n2. SQLBuilder when it gets an unresolved plan, it will also show the plan in the error message.\n\nI also took the chance to simplify the internal implementation of CreateViewCommand, and _removed_ a fallback path that would've masked an exception from before.\n## How was this patch tested?\n1. Added a unit test for the user facing error handling.\n2. Manually introduced some bugs in Spark to test the internal defensive error handling.\n3. Also added a test case to test nested views (not super relevant).\n","created_at":"2016-04-23T06:38:46Z","updated_at":"2016-04-24T06:57:25Z","closed_at":"2016-04-23T20:21:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9261396c1ae0c2e859140bf39ffa80d6547f7126","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9892ab5585fbc344ccbd656f38d3ab5edd04a36f","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14865","ref":"SPARK-14865","sha":"9892ab5585fbc344ccbd656f38d3ab5edd04a36f","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark uses `NewLineAtEofChecker` rule in Scala by ScalaStyle. And, most Java code also comply with the rule. This PR aims to enforce the same rule `NewlineAtEndOfFile` by CheckStyle explicitly. Also, this fixes lint-java errors since SPARK-14465. The followings are the items.\n- Adds a new line at the end of the files (19 files)\n- Fixes 25 lint-java errors (12 RedundantModifier, 6 **ArrayTypeStyle**, 2 LineLength, 2 UnusedImports, 2 RegexpSingleline, 1 ModifierOrder)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAfter the Jenkins test succeeds, `dev/lint-java` should pass. (Currently, Jenkins dose not run lint-java.)\n\n``` bash\n$ dev/lint-java \nUsing `mvn` from path: /usr/local/bin/mvn\nCheckstyle checks

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `build/mvn` provides a convenient option, `--force`, in order to use the recommended version of maven without changing PATH environment variable. However, there were two problems.\n- `dev/lint-java` does not use the newly installed maven.\n  \n  ``` bash\n  $ ./build/mvn --force clean\n  $ ./dev/lint-java \n  Using `mvn` from path: /usr/local/bin/mvn\n  ```\n- It's not easy to type `--force` option always.\n\nIf '--force' option is used once, we had better prefer the installed maven recommended by Spark.\nThis PR makes `build/mvn` check the existence of maven installed by `--force` option first.\n\nAccording to the comments, this PR aims to the followings:\n- Detect the maven version from `pom.xml`.\n- Install maven if there is no or old maven.\n- Remove `--force` option.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual.\n\n``` bash\n$ ./build/mvn --force clean\n$ ./dev/lint-java \nUsing `mvn` from path: /Users/dongjoon/spark/build/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin/mvn\n...\n$ rm -rf ./build/apache-maven-3.3.9/\n$ ./dev/lint-java \nUsing `mvn` from path:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the doGenCode() function for the EqualNullSafe predicate, in determining whether the two operands are equal, check that the right operand is not null, in addition to checking the left operand. This is because if only one of the operands is null, then the two operands are guaranteed not to be equal. Therefore, in order to have a valid comparison using `==`, both operands have to be non-null.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch was tested using the example given in the JIRA for this
