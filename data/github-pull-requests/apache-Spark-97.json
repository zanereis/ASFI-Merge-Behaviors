What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes `createDataFrame` to support DDL string as schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently DDL string as schema is ignored when the data is Python objects and the inference fails:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([(100, None)], \"age INT, name STRING\").show()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nValueError: Some of types cannot be determined after inferring, a StructType Schema is required in this case\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe DDL string as schema will not be ignored when the schema can't be inferred from the given data.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([(100, None)], \"age INT, name STRING\").show()\r\n+---+----+\r\n|age|name|\r\n+---+----+\r\n|100|null|\r\n+---+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nEnabled related

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis allows LocalRelation to use an actual datatype as its schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPassing the actual schema has a higher fidelity than using strings. Metadata for example is not passed when you a DDL string.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. It is an addition to the connect protocol.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated a test, and this works. I will do the PlanGenerationTestSuite in a follow-up.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-01T19:09:07Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T00:21:05Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T00:21:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a863321115a8627be5e1a0089de3d2d02b3241ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/510c14f9c6b67d693a34f37875f66c0e7038d5ae","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-42633","ref":"SPARK-42633","sha":"510c14f9c6b67d693a34f37875f66c0e7038d5ae","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixed the counter-intuitive behaviors of the `TimestampAdd` expression mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42635. See the following *user-facing* changes for details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This PR fixes the three problems mentioned in SPARK-42635:\r\n\r\n1. When the time is close to daylight saving time transition, the result may be discontinuous and not monotonic.\r\n2. Adding month, quarter, and year silently ignores `Int` overflow during unit conversion.\r\n3. Adding sub-month units (week, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond)silently ignores `Long` overflow during unit conversion.\r\n\r\nSome examples of the result changes:\r\n\r\nOld results:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// In America/Los_Angeles timezone:\r\ntimestampadd(DAY, 1, 2011-03-12 03:00:00) = 2011-03-13 03:00:00 (this is correct, put it here for comparison)\r\ntimestampadd(HOUR, 23, 2011-03-12 03:00:00) = 2011-03-13 03:00:00\r\ntimestampadd(HOUR, 24, 2011-03-12 03:00:00) = 2011-03-13 03:00:00\r\ntimestampadd(SECOND, 86400 - 1, 2011-03-12 03:00:00) = 2011-03-13

timezone:\r\ntimestampadd(quarter, 1431655764, 1970-01-01 00:00:00) = throw overflow exception\r\ntimestampadd(day, 106751992, 1970-01-01 00:00:00) = throw overflow exception\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass existing tests and some new tests.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-01T19:02:55Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T06:49:24Z","closed_at":"2023-03-03T06:38:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da74d3750b9d4a1a7cf76730c3e0964d902bfdb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40237/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40237/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40237/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7266d11997de8ea9cc4e3ebddbd7a98c4b35e261","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:SPARK-42635","ref":"SPARK-42635","sha":"7266d11997de8ea9cc4e3ebddbd7a98c4b35e261","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db/oss","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen using the 'builtin' Hive version for the Hive metadata client, do not create a separate classloader, and rather continue to use the overall user/application classloader (regardless of Java version). This standardizes the behavior for all Java versions with that of Java 9+. See SPARK-42539 for more details on why this approach was chosen.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a re-submit of #40144. That one introduced test failures, and potentially a real issue, because the PR works by setting `isolationOn = false` for `builtin` mode. In addition to adjusting the classloader, `HiveClientImpl` relies on `isolationOn` to determine if it should use an isolated copy of `SessionState`, so the PR inadvertently switched to using a shared `SessionState` object. I think we do want to continue to have the isolated session state even in `builtin` mode, so this adds a new flag `sessionStateIsolationOn` which controls whether the session state should be isolated, _separately_ from the `isolationOn` flag which controls whether the classloader should be isolated. Default behavior is for `sessionStateIsolationOn` to be set equal to `isolationOn`, but for `builtin` mode, we override it to enable session state isolated even though classloader isolation is turned off.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPlease see a much more detailed description in SPARK-42539. The tl;dr is that user-provided JARs (such as `hive-exec-2.3.8.jar`) take precedence over Spark/system JARs when constructing the classloader used by `IsolatedClientLoader` on Java 8 in 'builtin' mode, which can cause unexpected behavior and/or breakages. This violates the expectation that, unless user-first classloader mode is used, Spark JARs should be prioritized over user JARs. It also seems that this separate classloader was unnecessary from the start, since the intent of 'builtin' mode is to use the JARs already existing on the regular classloader (as alluded to [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24057#discussion_r265142878)). The isolated clientloader was originally added in #5876 in 2015. This bit in the PR description is the only mention of the behavior for \"builtin\":\r\n> attempt to discover the jars that were used to load Spark SQL and use those. This option is only valid when using the execution version of Hive.\r\n\r\nI can't follow the logic here; the user classloader clearly has all of the necessary Hive JARs, since that's where we're getting the JAR URLs from, so we could just use that directly instead of grabbing the URLs. When this was initially added, it only used the JARs from the user classloader, not any of its parents, which I suspect was the motivating factor (to try to avoid more Spark classes being duplicated inside of the isolated classloader, I guess). But that was changed a month later anyway in #6435 / #6459, so I think this may have basically been deadcode from the start. It has also caused at least one issue over the years, e.g. SPARK-21428, which disables the new-classloader behavior in the case of running inside of a CLI session.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, except to protect Spark itself from potentially being broken by bad user JARs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis includes a new unit test in `HiveUtilsSuite` which demonstrates the issue and shows that this approach resolves it. It has also been tested on a live cluster running Java 8 and Hive communication functionality continues to work as expected.\r\n\r\nUnit tests failing in #40144 have been locally tested (`HiveUtilsSuite`, `HiveSharedStateSuite`, `HiveCliSessionStateSuite`, `JsonHadoopFsRelationSuite`).","created_at":"2023-02-28T21:46:33Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T00:09:24Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T21:45:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d1648377c401faabceea24350b2b04c8f2796fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a31cd9bf95cd1282ea6fe6880693ad52332fc145","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen/SPARK-42539/hive-isolatedclientloader-builtin-user-jar-conflict-fix/take2","ref":"xkrogen/SPARK-42539/hive-isolatedclientloader-builtin-user-jar-conflict-fix/take2","sha":"a31cd9bf95cd1282ea6fe6880693ad52332fc145","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFollow on to SPARK-40034, Dynamic/absolute path support in PathOutputCommitters\r\n\r\nDynamic partitioning though the PathOutputCommitProtocol needs to add the target directories to the superclass's partition list else the partition delete doesn't\r\ntake place -the job extends the dataset, rather than replaces it.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\n* add an `addPartition()` method subclasses can use\r\n* add a `getPartitions` method to return an immutable\r\n  copy of the list for testing.\r\n* add the test.\r\n* Also fix `newTaskTempFileAbsPath(`) to return a path, irrespective of committer type.\r\n\r\nIn dynamic mode, because the parent dir of an absolute path is deleted, there's a safety check to reject any requests for a file in a parent dir. This\r\nis something which could be pulled up to HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol -it needs the same check, if the risk is considered realistic.\r\n\r\nThe patch now downgrades from failing on dynamic partitioning if the committer doesn't declare it supports it to printing a warning. Why this? well, it\r\n*does* work through the s3a committers, it's just `O(data)`. If someone does want to do `INSERT OVERWRITE` then they can be allowed to, just warned about\r\nit. The outcome will be correct except in the case of: \"if the driver fails partway through dir rename, only some of the files will be there\"\r\n\r\nFinally, it update the protocol spec in `HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol` to cover the dynamic partition job commit in more detail.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n\r\n* The code in SPARK-40034 was incomplete. The new tests show that it works now.\r\n* dynamic partition jobs aren't actually incorrect through the s3 committers, just slow, so if someone really wants it they should be free to.\r\n* The `newFileAbsPath()` code is required of all committers, despite its near-total lack of use.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUpdates the cloud docs to say that dynamic partition overwrite does work everywhere, just may be really slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests in `CommitterBindingSuite`; `\r\n\r\nNew test suite `PathOutputPartitionedWriteSuite extends PartitionedWriteSuite` which runs the `PartitionedWriteSuite` through\r\nthe PathOutputCommitter and with, on hadoop 3.3.5+ the manifest committer chosen.\r\n\r\nexecuted with\r\n* hadoop 3.3.4\r\n* RC2 of hadoop 3.3.5 through `-Dhadoop.version=3.3.5 -Psnapshots-and-staging\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-28T16:13:34Z","updated_at":"2023-06-10T00:19:35Z","closed_at":"2023-06-10T00:19:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e07dabecaf2848ade90ab1d1fff41856af02e543","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/536f2d67e9e1ef79444e466ec3484de7c9d134b5","head":{"label":"steveloughran:SPARK-41551-path-output-dynamic-lean","ref":"SPARK-41551-path-output-dynamic-lean","sha":"536f2d67e9e1ef79444e466ec3484de7c9d134b5","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

This affects all the users using numoy > 1.20.0\r\nOne of the types was fixed back in September with this [pull](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37817) request\r\n\r\n[numpy 1.24.0](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/22607): The scalar type aliases ending in a 0 bit size: np.object0, np.str0, np.bytes0, np.void0, np.int0, np.uint0 as well as np.bool8 are now deprecated and will eventually be removed.\r\n[numpy 1.20.0](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14882): Using the aliases of builtin types like np.int is deprecated\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFrom numpy 1.20.0 we receive a deprecattion warning on np.object(https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations) and from numpy 1.24.0 we received an attribute error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nattr = 'object'\r\n\r\n    def __getattr__(attr):\r\n        # Warn for expired attributes, and return a dummy function\r\n        # that always raises an exception.\r\n        import warnings\r\n        try:\r\n            msg = __expired_functions__[attr]\r\n        except KeyError:\r\n            pass\r\n        else:\r\n            warnings.warn(msg, DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)\r\n    \r\n            def _expired(*args, **kwds):\r\n                raise RuntimeError(msg)\r\n    \r\n            return _expired\r\n    \r\n        # Emit warnings for deprecated attributes\r\n        try:\r\n            val, msg = __deprecated_attrs__[attr]\r\n        except KeyError:\r\n            pass\r\n        else:\r\n            warnings.warn(msg, DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)\r\n            return val\r\n    \r\n        if attr in __future_scalars__:\r\n            # And future warnings for those that will change, but also give\r\n            # the AttributeError\r\n            warnings.warn(\r\n                f\"In the future `np.{attr}` will be defined as the \"\r\n                \"corresponding NumPy scalar.\", FutureWarning, stacklevel=2)\r\n    \r\n        if attr in __former_attrs__:\r\n>           raise AttributeError(__former_attrs__[attr])\r\nE           AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'object'.\r\nE           `np.object` was a deprecated alias for the builtin `object`. To avoid this error in existing code, use `object` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. \r\nE           The aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see the original release note at:\r\nE               https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom numpy version 1.24.0 we receive a deprecation warning on np.object0 and every np.datatype0 and np.bool8\r\n>>> np.object0(123)\r\n<stdin>:1: DeprecationWarning: `np.object0` is a deprecated alias for ``np.object0` is a deprecated alias for `np.object_`. `object` can be used instead.  (Deprecated NumPy 1.24)`.  (Deprecated NumPy 1.24)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed so pyspark can be compatible with the latest numpy and avoid \r\n\r\n- attribute errors on data types being deprecated from version 1.20.0: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations\r\n- warnings on deprecated data types from version 1.24.0: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.24.0-notes.html#deprecations\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe change will suppress the warning coming from numpy 1.24.0 and the error coming from numpy 1.22.0\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI assume that the existing tests should catch this. (see all section Extra questions)\r\n\r\nI found this to be a problem in my work's project where we use for our unit tests the toPandas() function to convert to np.object.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDisable substitution in values for the `StringSubstitutor` used to resolve error messages\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nwhen constructing an error message `ErrorClasssesJSONReader`\r\n\r\n1. reads the error message from core/src/main/resources/error/error-classes.json \r\n2. replaces `<fieldValue>` with `${fieldValue}` in the error message it read\r\n3. uses `StringSubstitutor` to replace `${fieldValue}` with the actual value\r\n\r\nIf `fieldValue` is defined as `\"${foo}\"` then it will also try and resolve foo. \r\nWhen foo is undefined it will throw an IllegalArgumentException\r\n\r\nThis is very problematic instance in this scenario. Where parsing json will fail if it does not adhere to the correct schema\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/133639/221866500-99f187a0-8db3-42a7-85ca-b027fdec160d.png)\r\n\r\nHere the error message produced will be something like \r\n\r\n`Cannot parse the field name properties and the value ${foo} of the JSON token type string to target Spark data type struct.`\r\n\r\nAnd because foo is undefined another error will be triggered, and another, and another.. until you have a stackoverflow.\r\nIt could be employed as a denial of service attack on data pipelines\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add examples of unblocked workloads after SPARK-42376, which unblocks stream-stream time interval join followed by stateful operator.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe'd like to remove the description of limitations which no longer exist, as well as provide some code examples so that users can get some sense how to use the functionality.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, documentation change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCreated a page via SKIP_API=1

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSet OMP_NUM_THREADS to `spark.task.cpus` instead of `spark.executor.cores` by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf OMP_NUM_THREADS is set to executor cores, we might still have issues when the number of executer cores is large but the number of task cpus is 1.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRun the following PySpark UDF script with these 2 Spark properties:\r\n\r\n- spark.executor.cores=3\r\n- spark.task.cpus=1\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\n\r\nvar_name = 'OMP_NUM_THREADS'\r\n\r\ndef get_env_var():\r\n  return os.getenv(var_name)\r\n\r\nudf_get_env_var = udf(get_env_var)\r\nspark.range(1).toDF(\"id\").withColumn(f\"env_{var_name}\",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefactor the AnalyzePlan RPC and add `session.version`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExisting implementation always return schema, explain string, input files, etc together, but in most cases we only need the  schema, so we should separate them to avoid unnecessary analysis, optimization and IO (required in `input files`).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes, new session API\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.version\r\n'3.5.0-SNAPSHOT'\r\n>>> \r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds  char/varchar length checks for inner fields during resolution when struct fields are reordered.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese checks are needed to handle nested char/varchar columns correctly. Prior to this change, we would lose the raw type information when constructing nested attributes. As a result, we will not insert proper char/varchar length checks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with tests that would previously fail.","created_at":"2023-02-28T02:18:09Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T19:08:15Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T07:50:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84b272365d3479eb5ccdeb5b9dfa16ad826bddeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/705f5b1f2b86f4d9902185d6ed04c6288e86b13e","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-42611","ref":"spark-42611","sha":"705f5b1f2b86f4d9902185d6ed04c6288e86b13e","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce a new physical type `Decimal128` for `DecimalType`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark SQL today supports the `Decimal` data type. The implementation of Spark `Decimal` holds a `BigDecimal` or `Long` value. Spark `Decimal` provides some operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` and so on. These operators rely heavily on the computational power of `BigDecimal` or `Long` itself. For ease of understanding, take the `+` as an example. The implementation shows below.\r\n```\r\n  def + (that: Decimal): Decimal = {\r\n    if (decimalVal.eq(null) && that.decimalVal.eq(null) && scale == that.scale) {\r\n      Decimal(longVal + that.longVal, Math.max(precision, that.precision) + 1, scale)\r\n    } else {\r\n      Decimal(toBigDecimal.bigDecimal.add(that.toBigDecimal.bigDecimal))\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWe can see add the two `Long` value if Spark `Decimal` holds a `Long` value. Otherwise,  add the two `BigDecimal` if Spark `Decimal` holds a `BigDecimal` value. The other operators of Spark `Decimal` adopt the similar way. Furthermore, the code shown above calls `Decimal.apply` to construct a new instance of Spark `Decimal`.  As we know, the add operator of `BigDecimal` constructed a new instance of `BigDecimal`. In short, Spark `Decimal` is an immutable physical type. Through rough analysis, we know the calculation operators of Spark `Decimal` create a lot of new instances of `Decimal` and may create a lot of new instances of `BigDecimal`.If a large table has a field called 'colA whose type is Spark `Decimal`, the execution of SUM('colA) will involve the creation of a large number of Spark `Decimal` instances and `BigDecimal` instances. These Spark `Decimal` instances and `BigDecimal` instances will lead to garbage collection frequently.\r\n\r\n`Int128` is a high-performance data type about 1X~6X more efficient than `BigDecimal` for typical operations. It uses a finite (128 bit) precision and can handle up to decimal(38, X). The implementation of `Int128` just uses two `Long` values to represent the high and low bits of 128 bits respectively. `Int128` is lighter than `BigDecimal`, reduces the cost of new() and garbage collection.\r\n\r\nSpark could support a new physical type to represent the `DecimalType` with `Int128`, it would improve the performance for calculation operators.\r\nNow, let's call the new physical type `Decimal128`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test cases.\r\n\r\nManual test

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTHis PR aims to ensure \"at least one time unit should be given for interval literal\" by modifying SqlBaseParser\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nINTERVAL is a Non-Reserved keyword in spark. But when I run\r\n```shell\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select interval from mytable\")\r\n```\r\nI get\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nat least one time unit should be given for interval literal(line 1, pos 7)== SQL ==\r\nselect interval from mytable\r\n-------^^^  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryParsingErrors$.invalidIntervalLiteralError(QueryParsingErrors.scala:196)\r\n......\r\n```\r\nIt is a bug because \"Non-Reserved keywords\" have a special meaning in particular contexts and can be used as identifiers in other contexts. So by design, INTERVAL can be used as a column name.\r\n\r\nCurrently the interval's grammar is\r\n```\r\ninterval\r\n    : INTERVAL (errorCapturingMultiUnitsInterval | errorCapturingUnitToUnitInterval)?\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\nThere is no need to make the time unit nullable, we can ensure \"at least one time unit should be given for interval literal\" if the interval's grammar is\r\n```\r\ninterval\r\n    : INTERVAL (errorCapturingMultiUnitsInterval | errorCapturingUnitToUnitInterval)\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change adds a `reason: String` to the argument list of `TaskScheduler.cancelTasks`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently all tasks killed by `TaskScheduler.cancelTasks` will have a `TaskEndReason` \"TaskKilled (Stage cancelled)\". To better differentiate reasons for stage cancellations (e.g. user-initiated or caused by task failures in the stage), we could add a reason argument in `TaskScheduler.cancelTasks`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemove the averaging in the case the number of elements in the heap is even. Always return the number from the large heap which matches what we would do if we sorted an array and returned the N'th element where `N = (percentage * num_elements).toInt`.\r\n\r\nBoth approaches are valid in terms of computing quantiles. For the purpose that PercentileHeap is used today both work just as well, except the version proposed in this PR is 30% faster (or put differently the version in master now is 50% slower than the version in this PR):\r\n\r\n```\r\nbefore\r\n58 ns per op on heaps of size 1000\r\n\r\nafter\r\n40 ns per op on heaps of size 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that scheduler is performance sensitive on scheduling decisions it is best if we pick the fastest implementation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests and benchmark.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-27T10:06:12Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T07:46:48Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T07:46:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"576f1e7d63d5b90452f67274ce2277bfab2e696e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3126434fe77835552a0ab35dede12521bddf182c","head":{"label":"alkis:faster-percentile-heap","ref":"faster-percentile-heap","sha":"3126434fe77835552a0ab35dede12521bddf182c","user":{"login":"alkis","id":265981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTk4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/265981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis","html_url":"https://github.com/alkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":470195531,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAadSw","name":"spark","full_name":"alkis/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alkis","id":265981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTk4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/265981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis","html_url":"https://github.com/alkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alkis/spark","description":"Apache

`tools` module\r\n- Add a new shell script `dev/connect-jvm-client-mima-check`, it will use `CheckConnectJvmClientCompatibility ` to check the mima compatibility of `connect-jvm-client` module.\r\n- Add `dev/connect-jvm-client-mima-check` to github task\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor fix test error report in `[VOTE] Release Apache Spark 3.4.0 (RC1)` mail list.\r\n\r\nTesting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enhance `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison` to support unwrap date type to timestamp type.\r\n\r\nThe way to unwrap date type to timestamp type are:\r\n```\r\nGreaterThan(Cast(ts, DateType), date) -> GreaterThanOrEqual(ts, Cast(date + 1, TimestampType))\r\nGreaterThanOrEqual(Cast(ts, DateType), date) -> GreaterThanOrEqual(ts, Cast(date, TimestampType))\r\nEquality(Cast(ts, DateType), date) -> And(GreaterThanOrEqual(ts, Cast(date, TimestampType)), LessThan(ts, Cast(date + 1, TimestampType)))\r\nLessThan(Cast(ts, DateType), date) -> LessThan(ts, Cast(date, TimestampType))\r\nLessThanOrEqual(Cast(ts, DateType), date) -> LessThan(ts, Cast(date + 1, TimestampType))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance.\r\n\r\nA common use case. We store cold data in HDFS by partition, store hot data in MySQL, and then union all the results. The filter in the MySQL branch cannot be pushed down, which affects performance:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t_cold(id bigint, start timestamp, dt date) using parquet PARTITIONED BY (dt);\r\nCREATE TABLE t_hot(id bigint, start timestamp) using org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc OPTIONS (`url` '***', `dbtable` 'db.t2', `user` 'spark', `password` '***');\r\nCREATE VIEW all_data AS SELECT * FROM t_cold UNION ALL SELECT *, to_date(start) FROM t_hot;\r\nSELECT * FROM all_data WHERE start BETWEEN '2023-02-06' AND '2023-02-07';\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR | After this PR\r\n-- | --\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to document how to perform chained time window aggregations. Although it is introduced as a way to perform chained time window aggregations, it can be also used \"generally\" to apply operations which require timestamp column against the time window data.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe didn't document the new functionality in the guide doc in SPARK-40925. There was a doc change SPARK-42105, but it only mentioned the unblock of limitations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, documentation change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCreated a page via `SKIP_API=1 bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` and confirmed. \r\nScreenshot:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"611\" alt=\"스크린샷 2023-02-28 오전 8 32 24\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanges are only in tests files.\r\n- Refactored the `TPCHBase` class and created `TPCHSchema` similar to TPCDS.\r\n- Created a base class `TPCSchema` which is extended by `TPCDSSchema` and `TPCHSchema`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR just refactors the code. Going forward it will help in making code changes at just one place to reflect in both TPCDS and TPCH. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan the PlanStabilitySuite to verify the changes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes `SparkConnectStreamHandler` to handle configs properly while planning.\r\n\r\nThe whole process should be done in `session.withActive` to take the proper `SQLConf` into account.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSome components for planning need to check configs in `SQLConf.get` while building the plan, but currently it's unavailable.\r\n\r\nFor example, `spark.sql.legacy.allowNegativeScaleOfDecimal` needs to check when construct `DecimalType` but it's not set while planning, thus it causes an error when trying to cast to `DecimalType(1, -1)` with the config set to `\"true\"`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] Negative scale is not allowed: -1. Set the config \"spark.sql.legacy.allowNegativeScaleOfDecimal\" to \"true\" to allow it.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe configs will take effect while planning.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nEnabled a related

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTrack load time for state store provider and log warning if it exceeds threshold\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have seen that the initial state store provider load can be blocked by external factors such as filesystem initialization. This log enables us to track cases where this load takes too long and we log a warning in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAugmented some of the tests to verify the logging is working as expected.\r\nSample logs:\r\n```\r\n14:58:51.784 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStore: Loaded

current behavior of the `compute` method in both `StateStoreRDD` and `ReadStateStoreRDD` is: we first get the state store instance and then get the input iterator for the inputRDD.\r\n\r\nFor RocksDB state store, the running task will acquire and hold the lock for this instance. The retried task or speculative task will fail to acquire the lock and eventually abort the job if there are some network issues. For example, When we shrink the executors, the alive one will try to fetch data from the killed ones because it doesn't know the target location (prefetched from the driver) is dead until it tries to fetch data. The query might be hanging for a long time as the executor will retry `spark.shuffle.io.maxRetries=3` times and for each retry wait for `spark.shuffle.io.connectionTimeout` (default value is 120s) before timeout. In total, the task could be hanging for about 6 minutes. And the retried or speculative tasks won't be able to acquire the lock in this period.\r\n\r\nMaking lock acquisition happen after retrieving the input iterator should be able to avoid this situation.\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch allows for eager execution of SQL statements using the Spark Connect Data Frame API.  The implementation of the patch is as follows: When `spark.sql` is called, the client sends a command to the server including the SQL statement. The server will evaluate the query and execute the side-effects if necessary. If the query was a command it will return the results as a `Relaiton.LocalRelation` back to the client otherwise it will return a `Relation.SQL` to the client. The client then simply forwards the received payload to the next operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

Recursively visits all subexpressions regardless of whether the current expression is a conditional expression.\r\n* For each common expression:\r\n  * Add a new boolean variable subExprInit_n to indicate whether we have  already evaluated the common expression, and reset it to false at the start of operator.consume()\r\n  * Add a new wrapper subExpr function for common subexpression.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate void subExpr_n(${argList}) {\r\n if (!subExprInit_n) {\r\n   ${eval.code}\r\n   subExprInit_n = true;\r\n   subExprIsNull_n = ${eval.isNull};\r\n   subExprValue_n = ${eval.value};\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n  * Replace all the common subexpression with the wrapper function `subExpr_n(argList)`.\r\n\r\n## New support subexpression elimination patterns\r\n\r\n* Support subexpression elimination with conditional expressions\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT case when v + 2 > 1 then 1\r\n            when v + 1 > 2 then 2\r\n            when v + 1 > 3 then 3 END vv\r\nFROM values(1) as t2(v)\r\n```\r\nWe can reuse the result of expression  v + 1\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT a, max(if(a > 0, b + c, null)) max_bc, min(if(a > 1, b + c, null)) min_bc\r\nFROM values(1, 1, 1) as t(a, b, c)\r\nGROUP BY a\r\n```\r\nWe can reuse the result of expression  b + c\r\n\r\n* Support subexpression elimination in FilterExec\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM (\r\n  SELECT v * v + 1 v1 from values(1) as t2(v)\r\n) t\r\nwhere v1 > 5 and v1 < 10\r\n```\r\nWe can reuse the result of expression  v * v + 1\r\n\r\n* Support subexpression elimination in JoinExec\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * \r\nFROM values(1, 1) as t1(a, b) \r\njoin values(1, 2) as t2(x, y)\r\nON b * y between 2 and 3\r\n```\r\n \r\nWe can reuse the result of expression  b * y\r\n\r\n* Support subexpression elimination in ExpandExec\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT a, count(b),\r\n   \tcount(distinct case when b > 1 then b + c else null end) as count_bc_1,\r\n   \tcount(distinct case when b < 0 then b + c else null end) as count_bc_2\r\nFROM values(1, 1, 1) as t(a, b, c)\r\nGROUP BY a\r\n```\r\nWe can reuse the result of expression  b + c\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSupport more subexpression elimination cases, improve performance.\r\n\r\nFor example, TPCDS q23b query,  we can reuse the result of projection `sum(ss_quantity * ss_sales_price)` in the if expressions:\r\n```\r\nif (isnull((cast(input[2, int, true] as decimal(10,0)) * input[3, decimal(7,2), true])))\r\n   input[0, decimal(28,2), true]\r\nelse \r\n   (input[0, decimal(28,2), true] + cast(knownnotnull((cast(input[2, int, true] as decimal(10,0)) * input[3, decimal(7,2), true])) as decimal(28,2)))\r\n```\r\nq4, q62, q67 are similar to the above.\r\n\r\n| Query    | Time with PR |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the scala version of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39925.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a plan_id that is both used for each plan created by the scala client, and by the columns created when calling `Dataframe.col(..)` and `Dataframe.apply(..)`. This way we can later properly resolve the columns created for a specific Dataframe.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJoining columns  created using Dataframe.apply(...) does not work when the column names are ambiguous. We should be able to figure out where a column comes from when they are created like this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated golden files.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes DB2 Limit clause syntax. Although DB2 supports LIMIT keyword, it seems that this support varies across databases and versions and the recommended way is to use `FETCH FIRST x ROWS ONLY`. In fact, some versions don't support LIMIT at all.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new trait `ReferenceAllColumns ` that overrides `references` using children output. Then we can skip it during rewriting attributes in transformUpWithNewOutput.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere are two reasons with this new trait:\r\n\r\n1. it's dangerous to call `references` on an unresolved plan that all of references come from children\r\n2. it's unnecessary to rewrite its attributes that all of references come from children\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nprevent potential bug\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.
