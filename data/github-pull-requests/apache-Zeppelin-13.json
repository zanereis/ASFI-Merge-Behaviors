What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors Cassandra interpreter to use new DataStax Java driver (4.x) that has new features & new architecture, that caused significant changes in the code base. But as result, we're getting:\r\n* We get supported version of the driver (3.x line will only receive critical bug fixes)\r\n* We get support for additional functionality of the DSE (DataStax Enterprise) - security, additional data types, etc.\r\n* Improvements in the load balancing, etc.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nRefactoring\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n* ZEPPELIN-4378\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n* Travis CI build: https://travis-ci.org/github/alexott/zeppelin/builds/681878444\r\n* Was tested manually in addition to the unit tests\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? Done, minor updates\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? There are renames & deletion of the configuration properties, but this doesn't break existing setups. The only breaking change is removal of \"standard\" retry policies from syntax - but it was necessary to do, as they not shipped with driver anymore.\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Documentation was updated\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-26T12:02:06Z","updated_at":"2020-05-01T11:28:38Z","closed_at":"2020-05-01T11:28:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a847efadc127fe66b679a9ae7effa6bdc999b49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/1c91453794e9a2493b44dcdb0a55cfe1a51e1c8d","head":{"label":"alexott:ZEPPELIN-4378","ref":"ZEPPELIN-4378","sha":"1c91453794e9a2493b44dcdb0a55cfe1a51e1c8d","user":{"login":"alexott","id":30342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott","html_url":"https://github.com/alexott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133980941,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM5ODA5NDE=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"alexott/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alexott","id":30342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott","html_url":"https://github.com/alexott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alexott/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

Because it may run out of memory when there's many spark interpreters running at the same time.

One is QuartzSchedulerService.java where it would read all notes and refresh their cron job. Another is JobManagerService. In order to solve the memory issue,  I introduce the `unLoad` method in `Note` to release memory in `QuartzSchedulerService` after refreshing cron job. Another approach is to disable JobManager (Job tab in zeppelin UI), The Job tab is not so useful IMHO. We should redesign that only to show the cron enabled jobs. But this redesign should be done later in another PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4680\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Manually tested\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

Because it would cause the issue of ZEPPELIN-4612. In this PR I will make Zeppelin still save note permission info into `notebook-authorization.json`. But I also do some code refactoring, and we could store the permission info into other storage such as database in future. Because storing them into one file also has potential issue. such as scale issue, now each time we have to write all notes' permission info into file instead of in the note level.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix | Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4635\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nThe rootNotebookFolder variable in VFSNotebookRepo.java does not contain the root directory in windows. For e.g. if notebook directory is \"C:/Users/zeppelin-notes\", the value of rootNotebookFolder set in VFSNotebookRepo.java:91 is \"/Users/zeppelin-notes\", which is not found in windows and throws an exception at launch.\r\nUsing `this.rootNotebookFolder = rootNotebookFileObject.getName().getURI().replace(\"file:///\", \"/\");` instead allows us to set the correct value for rootNotebookFolder (i.e. /C:/Users/zeppelin-notes).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the noteFileName (VFSNotebookRepo.java:110) variable is missing root directory in windows and using `String noteFileName = fileObject.getName().getURI().replace(\"file:///\", \"/\");` fixes this.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4574\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS CONTRIBUTED SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE APACHE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION SOFTWARE GRANT AND CORPORATE CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT VERSION R190612. \r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS LICENSED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE DISCLAIMED.

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR disables the local extraction of zeppelin-web.war if ZEPPELIN_WAR is pointing to a .war file. This has 2 advantages:\r\n1. Skipping WAR extraction improves Zeppelin launch time\r\n2. It prevents any problems arising from the corruption of local zeppelin-web extraction\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4573\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS CONTRIBUTED SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE APACHE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION SOFTWARE GRANT AND CORPORATE CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT VERSION R190612. \r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS LICENSED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE DISCLAIMED.
