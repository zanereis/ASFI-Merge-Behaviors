However, as we introduce supervisors for non-streaming use cases, such as the recently added `CompactionSupervisor` (and the upcoming `BatchSupervisor`), certain operations like resetting offsets, checkpointing, task group handoff, etc., are not really applicable to non-streaming use cases. \r\n\r\nSo the methods are split between:\r\n- `Supervisor`: common methods that are applicable to both streaming and non-streaming use cases\r\n- `SeekableStreamSupervisor`: `Supervisor` + streaming-only operations. The existing streaming-only overrides exist along with the new abstract method `public abstract LagStats computeLagStats()`, for which custom implementations already exist in the concrete types\r\n\r\nThis PR is primarily a refactoring change with minimal functional adjustments (e.g., throwing an exception in a few places in `SupervisorManager` when the supervisor isn't the expected `SeekableStreamSupervisor` type).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Moreover if there are 2 arguments - direct column & a simple extraction on a same column, the aggregator would reject them.\r\n\r\nThis commit aims to convert any argument with expression other than a direct column access into a virtual column and thereby making the expression different from the direct column. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

useful to supply dynamic parameters to automate periodic jobs. However, previously only MSQ `SELECT` queries could be parameterized. For example, consider the following MSQ `REPLACE` query with valid dynamic parameters:\r\n```sql\r\nREPLACE INTO foo\r\nOVERWRITE WHERE __time >= ? AND __time < ?\r\nSELECT TIME_PARSE(ts) AS __time, c1\r\nFROM (VALUES('2023-01-01', 'day1_1'), ('2023-01-01', 'day2')) AS t(ts, c1)\r\nWHERE c1 = 'day2'\r\nPARTITIONED BY DAY\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"type\": \"TIMESTAMP\",\r\n    \"value\": \"2023-01-01\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"type\": \"TIMESTAMP\",\r\n    \"value\": \"2023-01-05\"\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that the parameters will bind to the `?` placeholders in the query in place of the literal, but the query fails with the following exception:\r\n```\r\nInvalid OVERWRITE WHERE clause [`__time` >= ?]: Cannot get a timestamp from sql expression [?]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because there is a bunch of validation in the `IngestHandler` code that happens during the planning stage, which runs on the node where the rewrite hasn’t happened yet. This change moves the call to `rewriteParameters()` earlier in the planning stage so any validations will run on the rewritten root node.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

The goal is to compute less expensive filters first, thereby enhancing query performance. This PR aims to incorporate `estimatedComputeCost` into all `BitmapColumnIndex` classes, serving as an initial measure for estimating the cost of filters.  \r\n\r\nAn overall approach of estimating the cost is to assess how many bitmaps we expect to union or intersect. Dictionary lookup would also incur some overhead. \r\n* `AllTrueBitmapColumnIndex`, `AllFalseBitmapColumnIndex`, `AllUnknownBitmapColumnIndex`. The cost is 0.\r\n* `SimpleImmutableBitmapIndex`. The cost is 0. \r\n* `SimpleBitmapColumnIndex` instances. It generally involves one binary search, and maybe union with null bitmap. The cost is 1.\r\n    - Note I changed one usage in `ListFilteredDruidPredicateIndexes` to use `DictionaryScanningBitmapIndex` instead.\r\n* `DictionaryRangeScanningBitmapIndex`. The cost is the size of scanning range.\r\n* `DictionaryScanningBitmapIndex`. The cost is the size of dictionary.  \r\n* `BaseValueSetIndexesFromIterable`. \r\n    - `buildBitmapColumnIndexFromSortedIteratorScan`. Cost is max of value set size and dictionary size.\r\n    - `buildBitmapColumnIndexFromSortedIteratorBinarySearch`. Cost is value set size.\r\n    - `buildBitmapColumnIndexFromIteratorBinarySearch`. Cost is value set size. \r\n* `NestedVariantStringValueSetIndexes`. For each value, we need to look up from three global dictionaries (stringDictionary, longDictionary and doubleDictionary), and one local dictionary. Therefore we define a base cost of 3 (`INDEX_COMPUTE_SCALE`). The cost of building index from value set would be `3 * size of value set`.\r\n* `IsBooleanFilter` and `NotFilter`, the cost is the same as `baseIndex`.\r\n* `AndFilter` and `OrFilter`, cost is 0 since the bundle would sum up the cost of its child filters.\r\n* `SpatialFilter`. There's no good way to define cost, so putting down max integer for now, it'll always be evaluated last. \r\n\r\nTurned on `CURSOR_AUTO_ARRANGE_FILTERS` by default in this PR.\r\n\r\nWhile working on this PR, I had some ideas on refactoring some of the usages of `BitmapColumnIndex`, specifically:\r\n* Consolidate the usage of `SimpleImmutableBitmapIndex` and `SimpleBitmapColumnIndex`. The `BitmapColumnIndex` interface defines a method `computeBitmapResult(BitmapResultFactory<T> bitmapResultFactory, boolean includeUnknown)`. The `includeUnknown` param is not used in `SimpleImmutableBitmapIndex` because the bitmap is already pre-computed. Maybe we could have an `UnknownBitmapSupplier` instead. \r\n* Create a `DictionaryBinarySearchBitmapIndex` class which could extract the iterator definition out, maybe can replace all usages of `SimpleImmutableBitmapDelegatingIterableIndex`. \r\n\r\n### Benchmark comparison\r\nI'm comparing the results with `CURSOR_AUTO_ARRANGE_FILTERS` flag enabled and disabled.\r\n\r\n#### query 1\r\n>SELECT string2, SUM(long1) FROM foo WHERE string5 LIKE '%1%' AND string1 = '1000' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\r\n\r\nFlag off\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (deferExpressionDimensions)  (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       46           5000000  explicit        force  avgt    5  326.808 ±  5.295  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       46           5000000      auto        force  avgt    5  313.831 ±  3.502  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nFlag on\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (deferExpressionDimensions)  (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       46           5000000  explicit        force  avgt    5  110.170 ±  4.968  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       46           5000000      auto        force  avgt    5  109.375 ±  1.388  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### query 2\r\n>SELECT string2, SUM(long1) FROM foo WHERE string5 LIKE '%1%' AND (string3 in ('1', '10', '20', '22', '32') AND long2 IN (1, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 46) AND double3 < 1010.0 AND double3 > 1000.0 AND (string4 = '1' OR REGEXP_EXTRACT(string1, '^1') IS NOT NULL OR REGEXP_EXTRACT('Z' || string2, '^Z2') IS NOT NULL)) AND string1 = '1000' GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\r\n\r\nFlag off\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (deferExpressionDimensions)  (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       47           5000000  explicit        force  avgt    5  333.207 ± 14.524  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       47           5000000      auto        force  avgt    5  334.476 ± 39.445  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nFlag on\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (deferExpressionDimensions)  (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       47           5000000  explicit        force  avgt    5  106.400 ± 14.760  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       47           5000000      auto        force  avgt    5  105.784 ± 26.924  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### query 3\r\n>SELECT SUM(long1) FROM foo WHERE string5 LIKE '%1%' AND string1 = '1000'\r\n\r\nFlag off\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (stringEncoding)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       56           5000000  explicit              none        force  avgt    5  195.104 ± 3.935  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       56           5000000      auto              none        force  avgt    5  224.047 ± 1.598  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nFlag on\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (stringEncoding)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       56           5000000  explicit              none        force  avgt    5  8.200 ± 0.473  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       56           5000000      auto              none        force  avgt    5  8.243 ± 0.809  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n### This PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n- Adds support to the `iceberg` input source to read from Iceberg [REST](https://iceberg.apache.org/concepts/catalog/#decoupling-using-the-rest-catalog) catalogs.\r\n- Upgrades iceberg core dependency to `1.6.1`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n Adds support to the `iceberg` input source to read from Iceberg REST Catalogs.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR begins to introduce the concept of projections to Druid datasources, which are similar to materialized views but are built into a segment, and which can automatically be used during query execution if the projection fits the query. This PR only contains the logic to build and query them for realtime queries, and does not contain the ability to serialize and actually store them in persisted segments, so it is effectively a toy right now.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* Adds ProjectionSpec interface, AggregateProjectionSpec implementation for defining rollup projections on druid datasources\r\n* Adds projections to DataSchema\r\n* Adds projection building and querying support to OnHeapIncrementalIndex\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFix small typo in grpc-contrib README.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.

logic for calculating maximumCapacity (tatal capacity based on max workers from autoscaling) to task runners\r\n### Description\r\nIt is possible to get weird responses from the /totalWorkerCapacity endpoint if mmless ingestion is enabled and the overlord dynamic.autoscaler config is set. This is because the TaskQueryTool.getTotalWorkerCapacity gets totalCapacity from the overlord's task runner but gets maximumCapacity directly from the dynamic config.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to just expose a getMaximumCapacity method on TaskRunner that defaults to -1 (the default value of maximumCapacity) and gets overwritten.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nIn order to move getMaximumCapacity logic into each TaskRunner, i had to duplicate logic between HttpRemoteTaskRunner and RemoteTaskRunner since they have the same logic (check the overlord dynamic configuration), but I think this is okay in order for the task runners to be responsible for their own max capacity values.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- TaskRunner should expose a getMaximumCapacity field\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `TaskRunner`\r\n * `HttpRemoteTaskRunner/RemoteTaskRunner`\r\n * `KubernetesAndWorkerTaskRunner/KubernetesTaskRunner`\r\n * `TaskQueryTool`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

We suspect the same can happen at the broker, so we want to add this metric for the broker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

add `ApplyFunction` support to vectorization fallback, allowing many of the remaining expressions to be vectorized\r\n* add `CastToObjectVectorProcessor` so that vector engine can correctly cast any

multi-valuedness)\r\n* fix array constructor expression, apply map expression to make actual evaluated type match the output type inference\r\n* fix bug in array_contains where something like array_contains([null], 'hello') would return true if the array was a numeric array since the non-null string value would cast to a null numeric\r\n* fix isNull/isNotNull to correctly handle any type

patch makes the following adjustments to enable writing larger single rows to frames:\r\n\r\n1) RowBasedFrameWriter: Max out allocation size on the final doubling.\r\n   i.e., if the final allocation \"naturally\" would be 1 MiB but the\r\n   max frame size is 900 KiB, use 900 KiB rather than failing the 1 MiB\r\n   allocation.\r\n\r\n2) AppendableMemory: In reserveAdditional, release the last block if it\r\n   is empty. This eliminates waste when a frame writer uses a\r\n   successive-doubling approach to find the right allocation size.\r\n\r\n3) ArenaMemoryAllocator: Reclaim memory from the last allocation when\r\n   the last allocation is closed.\r\n\r\nPrior to these changes, a single row could be much smaller than the frame size and still fail to be added to the frame.","created_at":"2024-09-17T20:35:36Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T07:42:06Z","closed_at":"2024-09-19T07:42:03Z","merged_at":"2024-09-19T07:42:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"3d45f9829c7b80e3b5289aaf5710b3932639349e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

the processor used \"remainingChannels\" to track the number of non-null entries of currentFrame. Now, \"remainingChannels\" tracks the number of channels that are unfinished.\r\n\r\nThe difference is subtle. In the previous code, when an input channel was blocked upon exiting nextFrame(), the \"currentFrames\" entry would be null, and therefore the \"remainingChannels\" variable would be decremented. After the next await and call to populateCurrentFramesAndTournamentTree(), \"remainingChannels\" would be incremented if the channel had become unblocked after awaiting.\r\n\r\nThis means that finished(), which returned true if remainingChannels was zero, would not be reliable if called between nextFrame() and the next await + populateCurrentFramesAndTournamentTree().\r\n\r\nThis patch changes things such that finished() is always reliable. This fixes a regression introduced in PR #16911, which added a call to finished() that was, at that time,

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

methods to make it easier to check for equivalent virtual columns in the 'native' engine layer, even in cases where output names differ. This method isn't really used yet, but has some use cases in follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\nI have only implemented `EquivalenceKey` for `ExpressionVirtualColumn` and `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` so far, and really only needed it for `ExpressionVirtualColumn`. The default implementation just means a virtual column cannot participate in equivalence, since I noticed a handful of implementations (`FallbackVirtualColumn`, `HashPartitionVirtualColumn`, and `SettableLongVirtualColumn`) do not implement equals proper either. Given their use-cases, and the intended use-case of this method, I don't think it probably matters, though it should be easy enough to add them if we need it.","created_at":"2024-09-17T03:59:10Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T06:13:52Z","closed_at":"2024-09-17T20:17:44Z","merged_at":"2024-09-17T20:17:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"a93546d49324839faaa23fd73e073a0e6a36b327","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

#17062.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAllows usage of built in compression formats for Kinesis ingestion based on an optional `compressionFormat` parameter in `ioConfig`.\r\n\r\nUnlike Kafka, Kinesis does not provide much by the means of data compression - it is a common industry pattern to compress Kinesis data across the wire with client-implemented decompression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisite additions to CompressionUtils.java.\r\n- Added Jackson deserialization support to `Format` to enable simplified config exposure.\r\n\r\n- Added general `compress`/`decompress` utilities with `ByteBuffer`, `InputStream`, and `OutputStream` parameters\r\n  - User specifies desired compression/decompression format as method parameter\r\n\r\n#### Added `compressionFormat` Enum to IOConfig\r\n\r\n- By linking to a specified enum, the field's values are limited at load time - invalid values are automatically rejected by existing Druid spec safeguards.\r\n\r\n- Field is safely fed through:\r\n  - `KinesisSupervisor`\r\n  - `KinesisSupervisorIOConfig`\r\n  - `KinesisSamplerSpec`\r\n  - `KinesisTask`\r\n  - `KinesisTaskIOConfig`\r\n  - `KinesisRecordSupplier`\r\n\r\n#### Added handling logic to Kinesis Record Supplier\r\n\r\n- If compression is enabled, decompress the user record and replace the existing userRecord in-place. This ensures that:\r\n  1. We do not store both the compressed and decompressed versions of the record \r\n  2. Buffer sizes for calculating the aggregate size of outstanding Kinesis ingestion data act on the decompressed  / 'true' size of data\r\n\r\n```\r\n if (compressionFormat != null) {\r\n    userRecord.setData(CompressionUtils.decompress(userRecord.getData(), compressionFormat));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDiscussion remains open on competing designs - this is more or less a starting point of available functionality to provoke discussion (or implement if satisfactory as-is).\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nAdded support for compressed Kinesis streams. Users may specify a `compressionFormat` in IOConfig. Accepted values are `bz2`, `gz`, `snappy`, `xz`, `zip`, and `zstd`.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CompressionUtils`\r\n * `KinesisRecordSupplier`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster. (Active production use on streams >1GB/s aggregate throughput)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-17T02:06:23Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T06:24:15Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AmatyaAvadhanula","id":95239065,"node_id":"U_kgDOBa07mQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95239065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula","html_url":"https://github.com/AmatyaAvadhanula","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AmatyaAvadhanula/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

input formats like `csv` and `tsv` currently parse inputs only as strings, following the `RFC4180Parser` spec).\r\nTo workaround this, the web-console and other tools need to further inspect the sample data returned to sample data returned by the Druid sampler API to parse them as numbers. See [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/web-console/src/druid-models/ingestion-spec/ingestion-spec.tsx) for the relevant web-console code.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Introduce a new optional config `tryParseNumbers` for the `csv` and `tsv` input formats.\r\n- If enabled, the input format reader will parse numeric values from the input string for these text-based input formats.\r\n- By default, this configuration is false for backwards compatibility\r\n- Note that when enabled, this can have a small performance hit as the input needs to be parsed to determined the numeric type.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey classes to review:\r\n- `ParserUtils`\r\n- `CsvInputFormat`\r\n- `CsvParser`\r\n- `DelimitedInputFormat`\r\n- `DelimitedValueReader`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note:\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new optional config, `tryParseNumbers`, for the `csv` and `tsv` input formats.If enabled, any numbers present in the input will be parsed in the following manner --  `long` data type for integer types and `double` for floating-point numbers. By default, this configuration is set to false, so numeric strings will be treated as strings.\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis add a new `json_merge` expression which takes two or more arguments to merge into a single json structure. It also added the corresponding SQL function. This is useful for transforming data in druid, for instance I use it for flattening arrays of objects using fold, e.g. `fold((a, acc) -> json_merge(acc, json_object(json_value(a, '$.key'), json_value(a, '$.value'))), arrayofkv, json_object())`\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `json_merge` expression function\r\n * `json_merge` sql function\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis problem surfaced when I am attempting to get MM-less Druid running on ZGC with Kubernetes. \r\n\r\nAfter declaring `-XX:+UseZGC` under `JAVA_OPTS` for my services, I faced the following error for only the Coordinator, Overlord and Router:\r\n\"Error occurred during initialization of VM, Multiple garbage collectors selected\". \r\n\r\nIt turns out that the declaration of the G1GC in the cluster configuration causes the error to surface. I also find it weird that this G1GC configuration is only in the Coordinator/Overlord and Router configuration. By removing the G1GC configuration, I am able to run my cluster with ZGC. \r\n\r\nSince G1GC is the default option, there will be no change to Druid's default GC with this removal.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the multiple GC declared error.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Allow Druid to run non-G1 Garbage Collectors with `JAVA_OPTS`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

patch introduces QueryKitSpec, an object that encapsulates the parameters to makeQueryDefinition that are consistent from call to call. This simplifies things because we avoid passing around all the components individually.\r\n\r\nThis patch also splits \"maxWorkerCount\" into \"maxLeafWorkerCount\" and \"maxNonLeafWorkerCount\", which apply to leaf stages (no other stages as inputs) and nonleaf stages respectively.\r\n\r\nFinally, this patch also provides a way for ControllerContext to supply a QueryKitSpec to its liking. It is expected that this will be used by controllers of quick interactive queries to set maxNonLeafWorkerCount = 1, which will generate fanning-in query plans.\r\n\r\n~~Marked draft since this will not run properly until #17076 is merged.

Description\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17056, we increased the test JVM max heap from 2 GB to 2.5 GB as we were running into OOM issues in some tests. It was a temporary measure to unblock the CI/CD pipeline.\r\n\r\nOn digging into the heap dump, the issue seems similar to https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2503, and the suggestion was to use `Mockito.framework().clearInlineMocks()`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `Mockito.framework().clearInlineMocks()` to `MSQTestBase#AfterEach` to handle the memory leaks from Mockito's inline mocks, and reduces the test JVM max heap back to 2 GB.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

are two heavily parameterized tests that, together, account for about 60% of runtime in the `druid-processing` test suite.\r\n\r\nFrameFileTest changes:\r\n\r\n1) Cache frame files in a static, rather than building the frame file\r\n   for each parameterization of the test.\r\n\r\n2) Adjust TestArrayCursorFactory to cache the signature, rather than\r\n   re-creating it on each call to getColumnCapabilities.\r\n\r\nSuperSorterTest changes:\r\n\r\n1) Dramatically reduce the number of tests that run with\r\n   \"maxRowsPerFrame\" = 1. These are particularly slow due to writing so\r\n   many small files. Some still run, since it's useful to test edge cases,\r\n   but much fewer than before.\r\n\r\n2) Reduce the \"maxActiveProcessors\" axis of the test from [1, 2, 4] to\r\n   [1, 3]. The aim is to reduce the number of cases while still getting\r\n   good coverage of the feature.\r\n\r\n3) Reduce the \"maxChannelsPerProcessor\" axis of the test from [2, 3, 8]\r\n   to [2, 7]. The aim is to reduce the number of cases while still getting\r\n   good coverage of the feature.\r\n\r\n4) Use in-memory input channels rather than file channels.\r\n\r\n5) Defer formatting of assertion failure messages until they are needed.\r\n\r\n6) Cache the cursor factory and its signature in a static.\r\n\r\n7) Cache sorted test rows (used for verification) in a

(we should fix this issue)\r\nS2: If can't connect to kafka or kafka connection was broken, we can see negative lag. (negative is helpful to application, should not be skipped)\r\n\r\n\r\nskip emitting if there was negative lag, this is bad idea. \r\nFor S1, looks no impact on data ingestion, only emitter metrics is missing at few time points.\r\nFor S2, some companies already build monitoring based on the negative partition lag, if negative lag was not reported, their monitor will not work.\r\nBack to the negative lag issue, I think we should fix it instead of skipping.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor S1, why there was negative lag?\r\nIn class `SeekableStreamSupervisor`:\r\n\r\nupdateCurrentAndLatestOffsets() : PT30S\r\n--updateCurrentOffsets() -> get task reading offset : OFFSET1\r\n--updatePartitionLagFromStream() -> get partition writing end offset : OFFSET2\r\n\r\nin another thread:\r\n/druid/indexer/v1/supervisor/<id>/status -> SeekableStreamSupervisor::getStatus() -> SeekableStreamSupervisor::generateReport() -> calculation lag = OFFSET2 - OFFSET1\r\n\r\nWhen the negative lag issue happend? \r\n1) updateCurrentAndLatestOffsets() : executed\r\n2) /druid/indexer/v1/supervisor/<id>/status : invoked\r\n3) updatePartitionLagFromStream() : not executed\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the idea is we can make the OFFSET1 & OFFSET2  have the same version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=================================================================================\r\n**Problem 2: Bad design for getPartitionRecordLag() & getPartitionTimeLag()**\r\n\r\nWe want to support 2 kinds of partition lag, but like KafkaSupervisor, only need record partition lag. Like KinesisSupervisor, only need time partition lag.\r\nFor expansibility, if we want to add another type of partition lag, do we plan to add another method like: getPartition*Lag() ? \r\nAnd all the existing *Supervisor class need to implements the new method, sounds not make sense.\r\nFrom the design pattern side, provide 1 method with returned type is better than provide 2 separated methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nprotected abstract Pair<StreamPartitionLagType, Map<PartitionIdType, Long>> getPartitionLag();\r\n```\r\nvs\r\n```\r\nprotected abstract Map<PartitionIdType, Long> getPartitionRecordLag();\r\nprotected abstract Map<PartitionIdType, Long> getPartitionTimeLag();\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

patch reworks memory management to better support multi-threaded workers running in shared JVMs. There are two main changes.\r\n\r\nFirst, processing buffers and threads are moved from a per-JVM model to a per-worker model. This enables queries to hold processing buffers without blocking other concurrently-running queries. Changes:\r\n\r\n- Introduce ProcessingBuffersSet and ProcessingBuffers to hold the per-worker and per-work-order processing buffers (respectively). On Peons, this is the JVM-wide processing pool. On Indexers, this is a per-worker pool of on-heap buffers. (This change fixes a bug on Indexers where excessive processing buffers could be used if MSQ tasks ran concurrently with realtime tasks.)\r\n\r\n- Add \"bufferPool\" argument to GroupingEngine#process so a per-worker pool can be passed in.\r\n\r\n- Add \"druid.msq.task.memory.maxThreads\" property, which controls the maximum number of processing threads to use per task. This allows usage of multiple processing buffers per task if admins desire.\r\n\r\n- IndexerWorkerContext acquires processingBuffers when creating the FrameContext for a work order, and releases them when closing the FrameContext.\r\n\r\n- Add \"usesProcessingBuffers()\" to FrameProcessorFactory so workers know how many sets of processing buffers are needed to run a given query.\r\n\r\nSecond, adjustments to how WorkerMemoryParameters slices up bundles, to favor more memory for sorting and segment generation. Changes:\r\n\r\n- Instead of using same-sized bundles for processing and for sorting, workers now use minimally-sized processing bundles (just enough to read inputs plus a little overhead). The rest is devoted to broadcast data buffering, sorting, and segment-building.\r\n\r\n- Segment-building is now limited to 1 concurrent segment per work order. This allows each segment-building action to use more memory. Note that segment-building is internally multi-threaded to a degree. (Build and persist can run concurrently.)\r\n\r\n- Simplify frame size calculations by removing the distinction between \"standard\" and \"large\" frames. The new default frame size is the same as the old \"standard\" frames, 1 MB. The original goal of of the large frames was to reduce the number of temporary files during sorting, but I think we can achieve the same thing by simply merging a larger number of standard frames at once.\r\n\r\n- Remove the small worker adjustment that was added in #14117 to account for an extra frame involved in writing to durable storage. Instead, account for the extra frame whenever we are actually using durable storage.\r\n\r\n- Cap super-sorter parallelism using the number of output partitions, rather than using a hard coded cap at 4. Note that in practice, so far, this cap has not been relevant for tasks because they have only been using a single processing thread anyway.","created_at":"2024-09-13T08:14:49Z","updated_at":"2024-09-30T12:20:47Z","closed_at":"2024-09-14T22:35:21Z","merged_at":"2024-09-14T22:35:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd6706cd6ad553509659df45d38901ec1b76533d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

few CI jobs have been consistently failing on master due to OOMs. Specifically, some tests in the `Unit & Integration tests CI / unit tests (jdk17, sql-compat=true) / other_modules_test / other modules test (push)` are failing -- see error below.\r\n\r\nLooking at the heap dump, it appears that there are global references being retained which sort of point to Mockito. One candidate is the use of Mockito spy objects [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-core/multi-stage-query/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/msq/test/MSQTestBase.java#L531) that somehow have global references and don't get garbage collected.  It's not evident yet. The heap dump artifact can be found in any of the recent failed jobs.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, increase the JVM size from 2GB to 2.5GB to see if it helps alleviate the ongoing test failures.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning:  Tests run: 158, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 6, Time elapsed: 46.51 s -- in org.apache.druid.msq.test.CalciteArraysQueryMSQTest\r\n[INFO] Running

how FilterBundle is constructed in Filter and QueryableIndexCursorHolder. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `QueryableIndexCursorHolder` calls `Filter.makeFilterBundle` to build FilterBundle. The `BitmapColumnIndex.computeBitmapResult` is called at the same time. In the logical AndFilter and OrFilter, the ordering of child filters would affect what indices are chosen. Since filters could have different compute cost (a.k.a union multiple bitmaps is more expensive than single bitmap), we'd like less expensive filters to be computed first. \r\n\r\nAfter this PR, `QueryableIndexCursorHolder` builds a `FilterBundle.Builder` instance, which contains useful information such as `ColumnIndexSelector` and `BitmapColumnIndex`, then calls `builds` to build FilterBundle. The actual build logic still exists in `Filter.makeFilterBundle`, since `AndFilter/OrFilter` could have separate logic from other `Filter`. This enables `AndFilter/OrFilter` to sort its child filters by the computing cost in ascending order, before making the `BitmapColumnIndex.computeBitmapResult` calls. \r\n\r\nFor now, all indices would have a cost of `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, I intend to make a future PR to update cost for all inherited `BitmapColumnIndex` classes. Note that this PR would not have any real impact on building `FilterBundle`, since all filters having the same cost so there's no real sorting.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we've considered making `FilterBundle.IndexBundle` to store all indices and delay the index/matcher partitioning. The major con is that this seems like changing existing behavior too much and it could mean a lot of rewrite to existing `FilterBundle` class and `Filter.makeFilterBundle` method. \r\n\r\n### Benchmark comparison\r\n#### query 1 \r\n>SELECT string2, SUM(long1) FROM foo WHERE string1 = '1000' AND string5 LIKE '%1%' AND (string3 in ('1', '10', '20', '22', '32') AND long2 IN (1, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 46) AND double3 < 1010.0 AND double3 > 1000.0 AND (string4 = '1' OR REGEXP_EXTRACT(string1, '^1') IS NOT NULL OR REGEXP_EXTRACT('Z' || string2, '^Z2') IS NOT NULL)) GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\r\n\r\nbefore\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (deferExpressionDimensions)  (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       41           5000000  explicit        force  avgt    5  120.019 ± 2.536  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       41           5000000      auto        force  avgt    5  115.933 ± 3.654  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (deferExpressionDimensions)  (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       41           5000000  explicit        force  avgt    5  121.131 ± 1.423  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql         fixedWidthNonNumeric       41           5000000      auto        force  avgt    5  116.353 ± 2.335  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### query 2\r\n>SELECT SUM(long1) FROM foo WHERE string1 = '1000' AND string5 LIKE '%1%'\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (stringEncoding)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000  explicit              none        false  avgt    5  7.518 ± 0.310  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000  explicit              none        force  avgt    5  7.461 ± 0.220  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000      auto              none        false  avgt    5  7.475 ± 0.188  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000      auto              none        force  avgt    5  7.380 ± 0.170  ms/op\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (stringEncoding)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000  explicit              none        false  avgt    5  7.631 ± 0.430  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000  explicit              none        force  avgt    5  7.517 ± 0.205  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000      auto              none        false  avgt    5  7.534 ± 0.224  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000      auto              none        force  avgt    5  7.457 ± 0.332  ms/op\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *  `FilterBundle.Builder`\r\n * `FilterBundle`\r\n * `Filter`\r\n * `BooleanFilter`\r\n * `AndFilter`\r\n * `OrFilter`\r\n * `BitmapColumnIndex`\r\n * `QueryableIndexCursorHolder`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

changes:\r\n\r\n1) FrameProcessorExecutor now requires that cancellationIds be registered\r\n   with \"registerCancellationId\" prior to being used in \"runFully\" or \"runAllFully\".\r\n\r\n2) FrameProcessorExecutor gains an \"asExecutor\" method, which allows that\r\n   executor to be used as an executor for future callbacks in such a way\r\n   that respects cancellationId.\r\n\r\n3) RunWorkOrder gains a \"stop\" method, which cancels the current\r\n   cancellationId and closes the current FrameContext. It blocks until\r\n   both operations are complete.\r\n\r\n4) Fixes a bug in RunAllFullyWidget where \"processorManager.result()\" was\r\n   called outside \"runAllFullyLock\", which could cause it to be called\r\n   out-of-order with \"cleanup()\" in case of cancellation or other error.\r\n\r\nTogether, these changes help ensure cancellation does not have races. Once \"cancel\" is called for a given cancellationId, all existing processors and running callbacks are canceled and exit in an orderly manner. Future processors and callbacks with the same cancellationId are rejected before being executed.","created_at":"2024-09-12T17:23:59Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T03:14:13Z","closed_at":"2024-09-15T08:22:29Z","merged_at":"2024-09-15T08:22:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"6fac267f17d745cf6aac9419ae06b306a8898f09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

issue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\nIt is possible for the order of columns to vary across segments especially during realtime ingestion. \r\nSince, the schema fingerprint is sensitive to column order this leads to creation of a large number of segment schema in the metadata database for essentially the same set of columns. \r\n\r\nThis is wasteful, this patch fixes this problem by computing schema fingerprint on lexicographically sorted columns. This would result in creation of a single schema in the metadata database with the first observed column order for a given signature. \r\n\r\n### Release notes \r\nIn the CentralizedDatasourceSchema feature, different permutations of the same column order do not result in distinct schemas in the database.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor` was using the following operator pipeline for window processing: `(MSQ shuffling) -> NaiveSortOperator -> NaivePartitioningOperator -> WindowOperator`.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, we had the following issues:\r\n1. If we wanted to process a subset of rows (in the cases where we could), we had to have the comparison logic (on the `PARTITION BY` columns) in the `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor` layer. This is not good because:\r\n        1. The partitioning logic would be done again in the `NaivePartitioningOperator`, hence it's redundant.\r\n        2. It's a lot of code, making it unnecessarily difficult to follow the logic.\r\n2. `NaiveSortOperator` was a synchronization barrier. It needs to process all rows before sending data to the receiver.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces 2 new operators:\r\n1. `GlueingPartitioningOperator`: It continuously receives data, and outputs batches of partitioned RACs. It maintains a `last-partitioning-boundary` of the `last-pushed-RAC`, and attempts to glue it with the next RAC it receives, ensuring that partitions are handled correctly, even across multiple RACs. You can check `GlueingPartitioningOperatorTest` for some good examples of the \"glueing\" work.\r\n2. `PartitionSortOperator`: It sorts rows inside partitioned RACs, on the sort columns. The input RACs it receives are expected to be \"complete / separate\" partitions of data.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this PR's changes, we are converting the operator pipeline from \r\n```\r\n(MSQ shuffling) -> NaiveSortOperator -> NaivePartitioningOperator -> WindowOperator\r\n```\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n```\r\n(MSQ shuffling) -> GlueingPartitioningOperator -> PartitionSortOperator -> WindowOperator\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor` to send RACs of any number of rows into the operator pipeline, without having to do the partitioning on the `PARTITION BY` columns.\r\n\r\n### Other notable changes done in the PR\r\n1. `WindowOperatorQueryKit`\r\n        1. Add translation from `NaiveSortOperator -> NaivePartitioningOperator -> WindowOperator` into `GlueingPartitioningOperator -> PartitionSortOperator -> WindowOperator`.\r\n        2. Changed logic of creation of window stages. Previously we were creating a single window stage if we had an empty `over()` clause. But we can't do that now since we rely on MSQ shuffling to cluster the data on the partitioning keys for us, as we don't have `NaiveSortOperator` in the chain now.\r\n\r\n2. `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor`\r\n        1. Modified the operator so that we don't create the operator chain again and again for new RACs.\r\n        2. Modified the operator execution to not run it to completion, and control it manually, since we don't want the `completed()` to be called.\r\n        3. Logic changes to blindly send rows to the operator pipeline whenever `number of rows` crosses a threshold.\r\n\r\n3. Refactoring work: Created base abstract classes for the following pairs of classes:\r\n        1. `NaiveSortOperator` / `PartitionSortOperator`\r\n        2. `NaiveSortOperatorFactory` / `PartitionSortOperatorFactory`\r\n        3. `NaivePartitioningOperator` / `GlueingPartitioningOperator`\r\n        4. `NaivePartitioningOperatorFactory` / `GlueingPartitioningOperatorFactory`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `GlueingPartitioningOperator` and corresponding factory class\r\n * `PartitionSortOperator` and corresponding factory class\r\n * `WindowOperatorQueryKit`\r\n * `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to reject MVDs when used as `partition by` columns during window function processing for MSQ engine.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, a MSQ query like the following was failing with ClassCastException:\r\n```sql\r\nselect cityName, countryName, array_to_mv(array[1,length(cityName)]),\r\nrow_number() over (partition by  array_to_mv(array[1,length(cityName)]) order by countryName, cityName)\r\nfrom wikipedia\r\nwhere countryName in ('Austria', 'Republic of Korea') and cityName is not null\r\norder by 1, 2, 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up on https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17002, where a similar thing was done for sql-native engine.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new

Ability to set <code>endsWith</code> to match paths like <code>/test?query=string</code> up to the query string</li>\n<li>New option! Set <code>delimiters</code> for specific characters to be treated as parameter prefixes (e.g. <code>/:test</code>)</li>\n<li>Remove <code>isarray</code> dependency</li>\n<li>Explicitly handle trailing delimiters instead of trimming them (e.g. <code>/test/</code> is now treated as <code>/test/</code> instead of <code>/test</code> when matching)</li>\n<li>Remove overloaded <code>keys</code> argument that accepted <code>options</code></li>\n<li>Remove <code>keys</code> list attached to the <code>RegExp</code> output</li>\n<li>Remove asterisk functionality (it's a real pain to properly encode)</li>\n<li>Change <code>tokensToFunction</code> (e.g. <code>compile</code>) to accept an <code>encode</code> function for pretty encoding (e.g. pass your own

similar issues fixed in #11685 and #15880, this patch fixes a bug where QueryResource would write a closing array marker if it encountered an exception after starting to push results. This makes it difficult for callers to detect errors.\r\n\r\nThe prior patches didn't catch this problem because QueryResource uses the ObjectMapper in a unique way, through writeValuesAsArray, which

Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16768 added the functionality to run compaction as a supervisor on the overlord. This PR builds on top of that to restrict MSQ engine to compaction in the supervisor-mode only. With these changes, users can no longer add MSQ engine as part of datasource compaction config, or as the default cluster-level compaction engine, on the Coordinator. \r\n\r\nThe PR also adds an Overlord runtime property `druid.supervisor.compaction.defaultEngine=<msq/native>` to specify the default engine for compaction supervisors.\r\n\r\nSince these updates require major changes to existing MSQ compaction integration tests, this PR disables MSQ-specific compaction integration tests -- they will be taken up in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* CompactionSupervisor\r\n* CompactionSupervisorSpec\r\n* CoordinatorCompactionConfigsResource\r\n* OverlordCompactionScheduler\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
