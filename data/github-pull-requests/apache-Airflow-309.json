am aware that this pull request is not finished (tests, error handling, documentation). I would like to start a more concrete discussion on the externally triggered DAGs as mentioned in issue #417.\n\nWithin my company (http://blue-yonder.com) we are evaluating whether we could use airflow and I would really love to do so. Especially I liked the model you have chosen in the APIs and the possibilies to define the DAGs in Python. \n\nWhat we really need is the possibility to trigger DAGs externally. I read the discussion in the roadmap issue #417 and liked the ideas expressed there. I did a first prototype for the DagRun object and using this in the scheduler. Before investing further work in stabilizing this, I would like to get your feedback on whether this approach fits with the existing concepts. Does it make sense from your point of view to further work on that, or do you already have different plans/implementations?\n","created_at":"2015-10-12T14:28:40Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:41:13Z","closed_at":"2015-10-28T22:45:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8248ab44a056c7722ba74e217a4969894a1c1007","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/503/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/503/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/503/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b22052f8e9fb176c24e437094871ec19f31b0c81","head":{"label":"ctrebing:external_triggers","ref":"external_triggers","sha":"b22052f8e9fb176c24e437094871ec19f31b0c81","user":{"login":"ctrebing","id":4125322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjUzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4125322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing","html_url":"https://github.com/ctrebing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44110955,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDExMDk1NQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ctrebing/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ctrebing","id":4125322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjUzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4125322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing","html_url":"https://github.com/ctrebing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctrebing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ctrebing/airflow","description":"AirFlow

I am opening this PR to have some discussion. It is still work in progress, although functional.\n\nThis PR allows to specify the authentication backend in airflow.cfg instead of using the PYTHON_PATH. The old behavior is still available, but marked deprecated. However, if authenticate is True and the authentication backend fails to import the web server will fail to start. This is a behavioral change in order to make sure you do not run an inconsistent setup.\n\nNew config can be used adding the following (for example) the the [webserver] section of airflow.cfg\n\n```\nauthenticate = True\nauth_backend = airflow.contrib.auth.backend.ldap_auth\n```\n\nAs an example I have included and ldap authentication module (that should work against FreeIPA and AD as well as normal LDAP servers) and a kerberos authentication module. I am not entirely sure of I got all flask-isms right, so I wouldn't mind some pointers.\n\nCouple of questions / ideas\n- I saw some talk of using Flask App Builder. Flask App Builder has a more extensive framework for authentication (roles etc). Am I doing work here that is going to be outdated soon? :-)\n- Logout is not part of the standard templating where to put it (ie. this is my lack of Flask knowledge)?\n- Is the change in behavior acceptable?\n- ... anything I am

to #346, we have an environment with dockerized (and ephemeral) workers, meaning that having workers host logs from their own mini-webservers is infeasible because 1) the filesystem can be destroyed at any time and 2) the host address can change at any time. In the absence of a \"grand\" logging interface, this is a quick adjustment that ships (reads) logs to (from) S3 if the `base_logs_folders` begins with `s3:`. Workers will need to be able to write to the requested S3 bucket (via boto). In testing, this has been a valuable addition to our infrastructure -- debugging failed tasks without logs is no fun at all!\n\nThis shouldn't change any existing functionality. All it really does is look for the `s3:` url clue and, if found, uses boto to read/write the log files appropriately. Everything else is as-is, using a temporary directory for the local log

seen this request floating around... this PR lets users store dags in an S3 location.\n\nUsers need to add two lines to their `airflow.cfg` files:\n\n```\n[core]\ns3_dags_folder = s3://<s3 dags location>\ns3_dags_folder_conn_id = <conn id>\n```\n\nAny `.py` files found in the `s3_dags_folder` (and its subdirectories) are synced to an `__s3_dags__` subdirectory of the main airflow dags folder. Syncing is done through an `S3Hook`, which is why the `conn_id` is required. The folder is synced every 10 times that the DagBag's `collect_dags` method is called (so roughly once a minute with a default scheduler, but guaranteed to run every time an airflow command is issued since that creates a new DagBag). Syncing will mirror the S3 location, so new files will be added and old files will be deleted. \n\nI think for folks running airflow in a distributed manner (with many workers across different

allows you to schedule airflow tasks on a Mesos cluster.\nFor this to work, you need a running mesos cluster and perform following\nsteps -\n1. Install airflow on a machine where webserver and scheduler will run, let's refer this as Airflow server.\n2. On Airflow server, install mesos python eggs from [mesos downloads](http://open.mesosphere.com/downloads/mesos/)\n3. On Airflow server, use a database which can be accessed from mesos slave machines, for example mysql, and configure in `airflow.cfg`.\n4. Change your `airflow.cfg` to point executor parameter to MesosExecutor and provide related Mesos settings.\n5. On all mesos slaves, install airflow. Copy the `airflow.cfg` from Airflow server (so that it uses same sql alchemy connection).\n6. On all mesos slaves, run \n\n```\nairflow serve_logs\n```\n\nfor serving logs.\n7. On Airflow server, run \n\n```\nairflow scheduler -p\n```\n\nto start processing DAGs and scheduling them on mesos. We need -p parameter to pickle the DAGs. (See https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/pull/413 )\n\nYou can now see the airflow framework and corresponding tasks in mesos UI.\nThe logs for airflow tasks can be seen in airflow UI as usual.\n","created_at":"2015-09-17T09:21:17Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T07:20:04Z","closed_at":"2015-09-18T05:48:34Z","merged_at":"2015-09-18T05:48:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"2aa26a3e4642ac5345ddb2cb14d46d8d43fa3096","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/414/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/414/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/414/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5516f884b780807b63d7104fef516e9f9032d8cd","head":{"label":"kapil-malik:mesos","ref":"mesos","sha":"5516f884b780807b63d7104fef516e9f9032d8cd","user":{"login":"kapil-malik","id":3902288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3902288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik","html_url":"https://github.com/kapil-malik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39857124,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTg1NzEyNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"kapil-malik/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kapil-malik","id":3902288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3902288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik","html_url":"https://github.com/kapil-malik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapil-malik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kapil-malik/airflow","description":"AirFlow

allows you to schedule airflow tasks on a Mesos cluster.\nFor this to work, you need a running mesos cluster and perform following\nsteps -\n1. Install airflow on a machine where webserver and scheduler will run, let's refer this as Airflow server.\n2. On Airflow server, use a database which can be accessed from mesos slave machines, for example mysql, and configure in `airflow.cfg`.\n3. Change your `airflow.cfg` to point executor parameter to MesosExecutor and provide related Mesos settings.\n4. On all mesos slaves, install airflow. Copy the `airflow.cfg` from Airflow server (so that it uses same sql alchemy connection).\n5. On all mesos slaves, run \n\n```\nairflow serve_logs\n```\n\nfor serving logs.\n6. On Airflow server, run \n\n```\nairflow scheduler -p\n```\n\nto start processing DAGs and scheduling them on mesos. We need -p parameter to pickle the DAGs. (See https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/pull/394 )\n\nYou can now see the airflow framework and corresponding tasks in mesos UI.\nThe logs for airflow tasks can be seen in airflow UI as
