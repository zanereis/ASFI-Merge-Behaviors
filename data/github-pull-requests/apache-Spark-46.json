What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBump ap-loader from 3.0(v8) to support for async-profiler 3.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nap-loader 3.0(v8) has already been released, which supports for async-profier 3.0. The release guide refers to [Loader for 3.0 (v8): Binary launcher and AsyncGetCallTrace replacement](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/ap-loader/releases/tag/3.0-8). Breaking changes with async-profiler 3.0:\r\nasync-profiler 3.0 changed the meaning of the `--lib` option from `--lib path        full path to libasyncProfiler.so in the container` to `-l, --lib         prepend library names`, so the `AsyncProfilerLoader` will throw an `UnsupportedOperation` exception when using the --lib option with a path argument and async-profiler 3.0 or higher.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass GA. Tested in production environment of Spark cluster.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-03-01T07:13:17Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T19:46:03Z","closed_at":"2024-03-04T19:44:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d656cbbd910282775850e7009950630ba76c5c0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8d9428ba639fc2b04b971baadf458605cfdfc909","head":{"label":"SteNicholas:SPARK-47242","ref":"SPARK-47242","sha":"8d9428ba639fc2b04b971baadf458605cfdfc909","user":{"login":"SteNicholas","id":10048174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDQ4MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10048174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas","html_url":"https://github.com/SteNicholas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163978317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM5NzgzMTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"SteNicholas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SteNicholas","id":10048174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDQ4MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10048174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas","html_url":"https://github.com/SteNicholas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SteNicholas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SteNicholas/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe rule `ExtractGenerator` does not define any trigger condition when rewriting generator functions in `Project`, which makes the behavior quite unstable and heavily depends on the execution order of analyzer rules.\r\n\r\nTwo bugs I've found so far:\r\n1. By design, we want to forbid users from using more than one generator function in SELECT. However, we can't really enforce it if two generator functions are not resolved at the same time: the rule thinks there is only one generate function (the other is still unresolved), then rewrite it. The other one gets resolved later and gets rewritten later.\r\n2. When a generator function is put after `SELECT *`, it's possible that `*` is not expanded yet when we enter `ExtractGenerator`. The rule rewrites the generator function: insert a `Generate` operator below, and add a new column to the projectList for the generator function output. Then we expand `*` to the child plan output which is `Generate`, we end up with two identical columns for the generate function output.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by adding a trigger condition when rewriting generator functions in `Project`: the projectList should be resolved or a generator function. This is the same trigger condition we used for `Aggregate`. To avoid breaking changes, this PR also allows multiple generator functions in `Project`, which works totally fine.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now multiple generator functions are allowed in `Project`. And there won't be duplicated columns for generator function output.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport distinct window function when window frame is entire partition frame or\r\n growing frame.\r\nFor example,\r\nentire partition frame:\r\n```\r\nselect \r\n    a, \r\n    b, \r\n    count(distinct c) over (partition by a) as cc\r\nfrom t\r\n```\r\ngrowing frame:\r\n```\r\nselect \r\n    a, \r\n    b, \r\n    count(distinct c) over (partition by a order by b) as cc\r\nfrom t\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDistinct window function is a commonly used function and is supported by many SQL engines, such as hive, impala, clickhouse, and presto.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, after this pr, can use dinctinct window function like hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-01T02:44:37Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T00:20:31Z","closed_at":"2024-07-09T00:20:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"841bc58353e715974ba39cb4a289a8e8274a4c5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9bfbfa2aa8f70d0bdeef8370a715efd6ac09dbb6","head":{"label":"zml1206:distinct_window_function","ref":"distinct_window_function","sha":"9bfbfa2aa8f70d0bdeef8370a715efd6ac09dbb6","user":{"login":"zml1206","id":5275075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzUwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5275075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206","html_url":"https://github.com/zml1206","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":500757268,"node_id":"R_kgDOHdjzFA","name":"spark","full_name":"zml1206/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zml1206","id":5275075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzUwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5275075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206","html_url":"https://github.com/zml1206","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zml1206/spark","description":"Apache

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes an improvement to reduce executor memory usage by broadcasting the generated code during whole stage codegen.\r\n\r\nIn certain internal workloads, we have observed instances where the generated code can be large (up to tens or even hundreds of MBs), serving as the last straw leading to executor OOM. To enhance stability and handle such pathological cases, we make the `cleanedSource` (the generated code) a broadcast variable. Theoretically, this change would reduce memory usage for the code size from (`cleanedSource` * number of tasks) to (`cleanedSource` * 1) per executor, with the trade-off of network latency.\r\n\r\nThe feature is gated by a Spark conf `spark.sql.codegen.broadcastCleanedSourceThreshold`. This config sets a threshold to determine if we should use a broadcast variable for the generated code during WSCG. If it is set to a value less than 0, the feature is disabled, which is the default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nStability improvement.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Unit Test\r\nAdded a new unit test in `WholeStageCodegenSuite` for three cases:\r\n1. threshold is -1, shouldn't broadcast since smaller than 0 means disabled.\r\n2. threshold is a larger number, shouldn't broadcast, not yet exceeded.\r\n3. threshold is 0, should broadcast since it's always smaller than generated code size.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/spark$ build/sbt -java-home /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 \"sql/testOnly *WholeStageCodegenSuite -- -z SPARK-47238\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Manual Test\r\nFor the ease of demonstration, we created a query that generates a lot of \"comments\" which leads to large code size, and additionally configure the cluster with the following:\r\n- set `spark.sql.codegen.comments=true` to enable verbose comments.\r\n- set `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=false` to ensure whole stage codegen.\r\n- set `spark.driver.memory=10G` to give driver enough memory.\r\n- set a larger core numbers (16) and a smaller overall memory (1G) for executor.\r\n\r\n##### Build Locally\r\n```bash\r\n~/spark$ build/sbt -mem 10000 -java-home /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 package\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Without Broadcast\r\n1. create a local cluster, with the configs mentioned above.\r\n```bash\r\n~/spark$ ./bin/spark-shell --master local-cluster[2,16,1024] --conf spark.sql.codegen.comments=true --conf spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=false --conf spark.driver.memory=10G\r\n```\r\n2. run the artificial workload, executor OOM-ed.\r\n```bash\r\nscala> spark.sql(s\"select ${(1 to 99).map(i => s\"id as ${\"name\" * 300000}$i\").mkString(\", \")} from range(100)\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### With Broadcast\r\n1. create a local cluster, with the configs mentioned above, and further set `spark.sql.codegen.broadcastCleanedSourceThreshold=0` to ensure it's broadcasting\r\n```bash\r\n~/spark$ ./bin/spark-shell --master local-cluster[2,16,1024] --conf spark.sql.codegen.comments=true --conf spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=false --conf spark.driver.memory=10G --conf spark.sql.codegen.broadcastCleanedSourceThreshold=0\r\n```\r\n2. run the same artificial workload, the query finished successfully.\r\n```bash\r\nscala> spark.sql(s\"select ${(1 to 99).map(i => s\"id as ${\"name\" * 300000}$i\").mkString(\", \")} from range(100)\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a regression from Spark 3.5 to 4.0 caused by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43838 / https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41347 as the following code no longer succeed:\r\n```\r\nval df = Seq((1, 2)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\nval df2 = df.select(df(\"a\").as(\"aa\"), df(\"b\").as(\"bb\"))\r\nval df3 = df2.join(df, df2(\"bb\") === df(\"b\")).select(df2(\"aa\"), df(\"a\"))\r\ndf3.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that if we dig deeper then it turns out that if we omit the extra project from `df` then the following is a actually a regression from Spark 2 to Spark 3:\r\n```\r\nval schema = StructType.fromDDL(\"a int, b int\")\r\nval rows = Seq(Row(1, 2))\r\nval rdd = sparkContext.parallelize(rows)\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(rdd, schema)\r\nval df2 = df.select(df(\"a\").as(\"aa\"), df(\"b\").as(\"bb\"))\r\nval df3 = df2.join(df, df2(\"bb\") === df(\"b\")).select(df2(\"aa\"), df(\"a\"))\r\ndf3.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems to be `DeduplicateRelations` as it changes `df(\"a\")` (`a#7`) comming from the right side when it runs on the join:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.DeduplicateRelations ===\r\n!'Join Inner, '`=`(bb#12, b#8)              'Join Inner, '`=`(bb#12, b#18)\r\n :- Project [a#7 AS aa#11, b#8 AS bb#12]    :- Project [a#7 AS aa#11, b#8 AS bb#12]\r\n :  +- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]   :  +- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]\r\n :     +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]        :     +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n!+- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]      +- Project [_1#15 AS a#17, _2#16 AS b#18]\r\n!   +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]              +- LocalRelation [_1#15, _2#16]\r\n```\r\nand so later a `Project` node containing `df(\"a\")` above the join, that is added by added by the `.select()` API, can't be resolved.\r\nThis is because `DeduplicateRelations` always keeps the attributes of the first occurance of a node (`Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]` in this case) and creates new instances for other occurances. The rule doesn't (and can't) take into account if a top level attribute can actually come from a node or not.\r\nIf `spark.sql.analyzer.failAmbiguousSelfJoin` is enabled then the `DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin` catches the issue as\r\n```\r\nColumn a#7 are ambiguous. It's probably because you joined several Datasets together, and some of these Datasets are the same. This column points to one of the Datasets but Spark is unable to figure out which one. Please alias the Datasets with different names via Dataset.as before joining them, and specify the column using qualified name, e.g. df.as(\"a\").join(df.as(\"b\"), $\"a.id\" > $\"b.id\"). You can also set spark.sql.analyzer.failAmbiguousSelfJoin to false to disable this check.\r\n```\r\nIf it is not enabled then `a#7` can't be resolved error is thrown.\r\n\r\nThe PR attemps to fix the issue in following way\r\n1) If the projection fields contain AttributeReference which are not found in the incoming AttributeSet,  and the AttributeRef metadata contains the DatasetId info, then the AttributeRef is converted into a new UnresolvedAttributeWithTag and the original attributeRef is passed as paramter .\r\n\r\n2) In the ColumnResolutionHelper,  to resolve the UnresolvedAttributeRefWithTag, a new resolution logic is used:\r\nThe dataSetId from the original attribute ref's metadata is extracted.\r\n\r\n3) The first  BinaryNode  contained in the LogicalPlan containing this unresolved attribute,  is found.\r\nThen its right leg & left lag's unary nodes are checked for the presennce of DatasetID of attribute ref, using TreeNodeTag(\"__datasetid\").\r\nIf both the legs contain datasetId or neither contains, then resolution exception is thrown\r\nElse the leg which contains datasetId is used to resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo

It differs from TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE as follows: data stored in the database is normalized to the database time zone, and the time zone offset is not stored as part of the column data. When users retrieve the data, Oracle returns it in the users' local session time zone. The time zone offset is the difference (in hours and minutes) between local time and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time, formerly Greenwich Mean Time).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI was writing some tests in Spark Core and found this log from time to time\r\n```\r\nINFO AccumulatorContext: Attempted to access garbage collected accumulator 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is, unit tests create `FakeTask` directly without a `Stage`, and the `FakeTask` creates a temporary `TaskMetrics` object then keeps the serialized bytes. This means the `TaskMetrics` accumulators are not referenced by anyone and will be GCed.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by referencing the temporary `TaskMetrics` in `FakeTask`, to avoid the confusing logs in the unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\navoid confusing logs when running unit tests\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nN/A, test-only change\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSwitch any usage of [`Thread.getId()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#getId()) to the final method [`Thread.threadId()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#threadId()). \r\n\r\nThis is an official Java recommendation after Java 19, as they state for `getId()`:\r\n\r\n> This method is not final and may be overridden to return a value that is not the thread ID. Use [threadId()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#threadId()) instead.\r\n\r\nMore info [here](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8017617?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Aall-tabpanel). \r\n\r\nNo behavioral changes to Spark expected here as both the old and new methods return the same long value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMultiple usages of Thread.getId() emitted some warning statements in the build. I decided to just cleanup those warning statements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNo new tests were added due to only switching done of internal Java method, Java Docs suggest `threadId()` as a replacement for `getId()`, so I believe we can trust it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-29T04:32:04Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T16:59:44Z","closed_at":"2024-02-29T16:57:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd95cc8c113875fe0e952b698ff66f4523fa3e0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change signature `CsvParser` to `AbstractParser` (its parent class).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- It's better to use higher classes if they fit for better extendibility and maintenance.\r\n- Univocity parser became inactive for the last three years, and we're missing bug fixes such as https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/pull/533. We should probably leverage their interface, and implement it in Spark for bug fixes and further performance improvement. This is a basework.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test cases should cover.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-29T02:47:15Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T07:50:47Z","closed_at":"2024-02-29T07:50:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87dd2e0e1e7d8b42dc8215f41b104e7562594c66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45328/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45328/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45328/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9008503de0ed35a00b8f39a84fb9b3984697425e","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-47221","ref":"SPARK-47221","sha":"9008503de0ed35a00b8f39a84fb9b3984697425e","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd TaskCompletionListener to close inputStream to avoid thread leakage caused by unclosed ReadAheadInputStream.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-40849 modified the implementation of `newDaemonSingleThreadExecutor` to use `newFixedThreadPool` instead of `newSingleThreadExecutor` .The difference is that `newSingleThreadExecutor` uses the `FinalizableDelegatedExecutorService`, which provides a `finalize` method that automatically closes the thread pool. In some cases, sort merge join execution uses `ReadAheadSteam` and does not close it, so this change caused a thread leak. Since Finalization is deprecated and subject to removal in a future release, we should close the associated streams instead of relying on the finalize method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-29T02:31:06Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T10:12:30Z","closed_at":"2024-03-05T05:17:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b1c727a64760060bce323595d91819aed384fba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84022f13375a5cad671b31d138d9e230aa25c8ca","head":{"label":"JacobZheng0927:SPARK-47146","ref":"SPARK-47146","sha":"84022f13375a5cad671b31d138d9e230aa25c8ca","user":{"login":"JacobZheng0927","id":29793663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzkzNjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29793663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927","html_url":"https://github.com/JacobZheng0927","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":684980567,"node_id":"R_kgDOKNP5Vw","name":"spark","full_name":"JacobZheng0927/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JacobZheng0927","id":29793663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzkzNjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29793663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927","html_url":"https://github.com/JacobZheng0927","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JacobZheng0927/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JacobZheng0927/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a Python UDTF API for 'analyze' method to differentiate constant NULL arguments and other types of arguments.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, each `AnalyzeArgument` had a `value` field which was non-None if the argument was a constant-foldable scalar expression:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\r\nclass AnalyzeArgument:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    The argument for Python UDTF's analyze static method.\r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    dataType : :class:`DataType`\r\n        The argument's data type\r\n    value : any, optional\r\n        The calculated value if the argument is foldable; otherwise None\r\n    isTable : bool\r\n        If True, the argument is a table argument.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    dataType: DataType\r\n    value: Optional[Any]\r\n    isTable: bool\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it was also `None` if the argument is literal NULL! This is a challenge for UDTF authors who want to tell exactly which scalar arguments were literal NULL.\r\n\r\nNow we add a new field to tell the difference:\r\n\r\n```\r\nisConstantExpression : bool\r\n    If True, the argument is a constant-foldable scalar expression. Then the 'value' field\r\n    contains None if the argument is a NULL literal, or a non-None value if the argument is a\r\n    non-NULL literal. In this way, we can distinguish between a literal NULL argument and other\r\n    types of arguments such as complex expression trees or table arguments where the 'value'\r\n    field is always None.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR applies test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen using Connect with PySpark, string collation silently gets dropped:\r\n```\r\nClient connected to the Spark Connect server at localhost\r\nSparkSession available as 'spark'.\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"select 'abc' collate 'UNICODE'\")\r\nDataFrame[collate(abc): string]\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StringType, StructField\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([], StructType([StructField('id', StringType(2))]))\r\nDataFrame[id: string]\r\n```\r\nInstead of `string` type in dataframe, we should be seeing `string COLLATE 'UNICODE'`.\r\n\r\nFix the issue by adding collation info to conversions under connect `UnparsedDataType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo enable correct behavior with PySpark connect collated strings.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, with these changes the user gets correct string collation from PySpark connect session.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test which simulates the described scenario.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces a new V2 min-in HasPartitionStatistics which can be used to return the partition statistics of a InputPartition.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs part of the Storage Partitioned Join work ([SPIP](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37166)), we'll need to introduce a way for a V2 InputPartition to return its partition size,  It's useful for a InputPartition to also report its size (in bytes), so that Spark can use the info to decide whether partition grouping should be applied or not. \r\n\r\nThis will be used later in follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new V2 mix-in HasPartitionStatistics will be introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExtended InMemoryTable to support this new interface, and added a new unit test to verify the API, and the mock the partition statistics to test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nno\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-28T11:31:30Z","updated_at":"2024-03-27T04:57:58Z","closed_at":"2024-03-27T04:56:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d2e68ec89c376a22132141a4d6e4bc8cf388054","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45314/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45314/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45314/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ceaea0226d03adf943f9bf4ca2472e969a52e3a","head":{"label":"zhuqi-lucas:SPARK-42040","ref":"SPARK-42040","sha":"9ceaea0226d03adf943f9bf4ca2472e969a52e3a","user":{"login":"zhuqi-lucas","id":12184649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12184649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuqi-lucas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":315535227,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU1MzUyMjc=","name":"spark","full_name":"zhuqi-lucas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhuqi-lucas","id":12184649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12184649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuqi-lucas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhuqi-lucas/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake `spark-sql`, `spark-shell` be able to access iceberg with HiveCatalog.\r\nIf a user want to access iceberg table with HiveCatalog through `spark-sql`, `spark-shell`, the user should specify additional configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spark-sql --conf spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions \\\r\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.hadoop_prod=org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog \\\r\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.hadoop_prod.type=hive \\\r\n--conf spark.sql.catalog.hadoop_prod.uri=thrift://hms1.example.com:9083,thrift://hms2.example.com:9083 \\\r\n--conf spark.hadoop.iceberg.engine.hive.enabled=true \\\r\n--conf spark.jars=hdfs:///some/path/to/iceberg-spark-runtime-3.2_2.12-1.4.3.jar \\\r\n--conf spark.hadoop.hive.aux.jars.path=hdfs:///some/path/to/iceberg-hive-runtime-1.4.3.jar \\\r\n--conf spark.security.credentials.hive.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`spark-sql` and `spark-shell` cannot access iceberg table with HiveCatalog because there is no HIVE_DELEGATION_TOKEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf there is a user who specify `--conf spark.security.credentials.hive.enabled=true`, spark will get HIVE_DELEGATION_TOKEN even though deploy mode is not \"cluster\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually tested on on-premise internal cluster with Hadoop 3.3.4, Iceberg 1.4.3, and Spark 3.2.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

For each python streaming data sink instance there will be a long live python worker process created. Inside the python process, the python write committer will receive abort or commit function call and send back result through socket.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn order to support developing spark streaming sink in python, we need to implement python stream writer interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit and integration test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-28T04:43:39Z","updated_at":"2024-03-27T03:51:42Z","closed_at":"2024-03-27T03:51:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc3df495cf901f39088fe1ad336b4d36f13d1a55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of fcc5dbc9b6c8a8e16dc2e0854f3eebc8758a5826 / https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45036 with a tweak so that it works on Scala 2.12.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a correctness bug fix.\r\n\r\nThe original fix against `master` suppresses a warning category that doesn't exist on certain versions of Scala 2.13 and 2.12, and the exact versions are [not documented anywhere][1].\r\n\r\nTo be safe, this backport simply suppresses all warnings instead of just `other-non-cooperative-equals`. It would be interesting to see if `-Wconf:nowarn` complains, since the warning about non-cooperative equals itself is also not thrown on all versions of Scala, but I don't think that's a priority.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/8120#issuecomment-1967413860\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI + added tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-27T23:36:16Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T16:37:01Z","closed_at":"2024-02-28T02:31:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09bc1e24a70efdab18601925c84e25b2e83581a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45296/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45296/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45296/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6dc3e85e36ea9c8d6faa15328dbe0081ce9f9b30","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-45599-OpenHashSet","ref":"SPARK-45599-OpenHashSet","sha":"6dc3e85e36ea9c8d6faa15328dbe0081ce9f9b30","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `core` module to succeed SBT tests by preserving `mockito-core`'s `byte-buddy` test dependency.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `Maven` respects `mockito-core`'s byte-buddy dependency while SBT doesn't.\r\n**MAVEN**\r\n```\r\n$ build/mvn dependency:tree -pl core | grep byte-buddy\r\n...\r\n[INFO] |  +- net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy:jar:1.12.10:test\r\n[INFO] |  +- net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy-agent:jar:1.12.10:test\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SBT**\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/test:dependencyTree\" | grep

`branch-3.4` from Apache Spark 3.4.0~3.4.2 only. branch-3.3/branch-3.5/master are okay.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly

this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-27T21:24:38Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T02:23:04Z","closed_at":"2024-02-28T02:23:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a32bdf179043de477411ba0863945b640df182a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45295/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45295/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45295/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b24a086e0c9bf15d96fedddc1c92eb091f58d9da","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-47196","ref":"SPARK-47196","sha":"b24a086e0c9bf15d96fedddc1c92eb091f58d9da","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, I propose to wrap unaliased params in aliases with the same name without introducing changes to the existing parser.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBy standard, this should work, but when using params without aliases it throws an error:\r\n```\r\nDECLARE parm = 'Hello';\r\n\r\n--NOT OK\r\nEXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT :parm' USING parm;\r\n[ALL_PARAMETERS_MUST_BE_NAMED] Using name parameterized queries requires all parameters to be named. Parameters missing names: \"parm\". SQLSTATE: 07001\r\n\r\n--OK\r\nEXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT :parm' USING parm AS parm;\r\nHello\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nUsers could not previously use the above-mentioned command in Spark and needed to use `AS parm`. Now users do not need to use aliases for the parameters of the same name.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test in a new suite `sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/ExecuteImmediateEndToEndSuite.scala`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSome commands like ALTER TABLE and REPLACE VIEW need to uncache the table/view. Today the implementation simply does `sparkSession.catalog.uncacheTable(name)`, which looks up the table/view. This PR improves it by using the existing `CacheManager.uncacheTableOrView` function, which does not need to look up the table view.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nsmall perf improvement (reduce metastore RPC calls)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds `COLLATION_ENABLED` config to `SQLConf` and introduces new error class `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.COLLATION` to appropriately report error on usage of feature under development. \r\n\r\nCloses #45218\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to make collations configurable on this flag. These changes disable usage of `collate` and `collation` functions, along with any `COLLATE` syntax when the flag is set to false. By default, the flag is set to false.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It introduces new error along with an appropriate message.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\n./build/mvn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryCompilationErrorsSuite test\r\n./build/mvn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CollationExpressionSuite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to increase the timeout between between actions in `KafkaContinuousSourceSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn Mac OS build, those tests fail indeterministically, see\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/8054862135/job/22000404856\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/8040413156/job/21958488693\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/8032862212/job/21942732320\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/8024427919/job/21937366481\r\n\r\n`KafkaContinuousSourceSuite` is specifically slow in Mac OS. Kafka producers send the messages correctly, but the consumers can't get the messages for some reasons. You can't get the offsets for long time. This is not an issue in micro batch but I fail to identify the difference.\r\n\r\nI just decided to increase the timeout between actions for now. This is more just a workaround.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in my Mac.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-02-27T10:20:17Z","updated_at":"2024-02-27T15:36:37Z","closed_at":"2024-02-27T15:36:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d42d84e15642b041324c409e92f50481343f66e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to improve error message from SparkThrowableSuite for better debuggability\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current error message is not very actionable for developer who need regenerating the error class documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API change, but the error message is changed:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\nThe error class document is not up to date. Please regenerate it.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```\r\nhe error class document is not up to date. Please regenerate it by running `SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite -- -t \\\"Error classes match with document\\\"\"`\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to have a new helper function to help tree traversal: `resolveExpressionsUpWithPruning`. This helper function traverses all expressions of a query tree bottom up and skipping the subtree if the condition returns false.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWithout this helper function, a developer will need to combine `plan.resolveOperatorsUpWithPruning` and `case p: LogicalPlan => p.transformExpressionsUpWithPruning` to achieve the same thing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisable parquet filter pushdown when expression is referencing a non default collated column/field in a struct.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBecause parquet min/max stats don't know about the concept of collation and data skipping based on them could lead to incorrect results for certain collation types (lowercase collation for example).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nUsers should now always get the correct result when using collated string columns.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nWith new UTs in `ParquetFilterSuite`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDisable bucketing on columns that are non default collated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith current implementation bucketIds are generated from a string value where each unique string guarantees unique id, but when collation is turned on, this is not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds new error class.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\n./build/mvn -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.SparkThrowableSuite test\r\n./build/mvn
