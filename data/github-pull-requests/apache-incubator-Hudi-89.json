What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Fixing Index look up to return partitions for a given key along with fileId with Global Bloom\r\n- Use-case: If a record is updated with Partition2, which was previously inserted with Partition1, with global index as index type, this patch will ignore Partition2 and will update the record in Partition1. \r\n\r\nUse-case: \r\nIf a record is updated with a different partition than where it exists, with Global bloom, an exception is thrown as given [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-389). This patch fixes the same. \r\n\r\nEssentially in HoodieGlobaIndex#tagLocationBacktoRecords, each record is tagged with the right fileId and Partition and not just fileId (which was the case before this patch). In order to achieve this, I had to change the interface for IndexFileFilter from getMatchingFiles(String partitionPath, String recordKey) returning Set<FileId>s to returning Set<Pair<ParitionPath, fileId>>s. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Change interface of IndexfileFilter to return Set<Pair<PartitionPath, fileId>>\r\n  - Fix Global Bloom to tag records with correct partitonPath from index look up and not from the passed in records(HoodieKey). \r\n\r\nTests:\r\n\r\nAdded test in TestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage#testUpsertToDiffPartitionGlobaIndex.

from this pull request have been consolidated and moved to  https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1233.**\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nDiskBasedMap is used by ExternalSpillableMap for writing (K,V) pair to a file,\r\n  keeping the (K, fileMetadata) in memory, to reduce the foot print of the record on disk.\r\n\r\n  This change improves the performance of the record get/read (random read/sequential read) and put/write operations from/to disk, by introducing a data buffer/cache.\r\n\r\n  Before the performance improvement:\r\nRecordsHandled:\t10000\ttotalTestTime:\t3145\twriteTime:\t1176\treadTime:\t255\r\nRecordsHandled:\t50000\ttotalTestTime:\t5775\twriteTime:\t4187\treadTime:\t1175\r\nRecordsHandled:\t100000\ttotalTestTime:\t10570\twriteTime:\t7718\treadTime:\t2203\r\nRecordsHandled:\t500000\ttotalTestTime:\t59723\twriteTime:\t45618\treadTime:\t11093\r\nRecordsHandled:\t1000000\ttotalTestTime:\t120022\twriteTime:\t87918\treadTime:\t22355\r\nRecordsHandled:\t2000000\ttotalTestTime:\t258627\twriteTime:\t187185\treadTime:\t56431\r\n\r\n

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are only two reporters MetricsGraphiteReporter and InMemoryMetricsReporter. InMemoryMetricsReporter is used for testing. So actually we only have one metrics reporter. Since JMX is a standard of the monitor on the JVM platform, I propose to provide a JMX metrics reporter.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*The changes are as follows:*\r\n  - *pom.xml*\r\n  -

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHi, opening this pull request for feedback on the goal here and approach. Very open to alternatives to accomplish this functionality.\r\n\r\nTo provide a way for Hudi users to delete/update records with same record_key across all partitions without first querying to find the partitions.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I have seen the JIRA that wants to set the HoodieIndex as part of the table properties. This conflicts with the usecase here. Can you help me understand the motivation of locking down the index type?\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis change adds the HoodieGlobalPartitionBloomIndex. This index is\r\nintended to be compatible with the HoodieBloomIndex but allow you to\r\nupdate and delete records across all partitions.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nCurrent tests pass.\r\nTests can be added for this specific feature. Looking for feedback on the approach to this first.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-26T23:16:14Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T19:42:53Z","closed_at":"2019-12-10T19:42:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f577d4f780648b1263903e8729d61aaf7655107","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1052/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1052/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1052/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/b22a55a78c9f10b1e81eb60513c2b594e64dff9d","head":{"label":"bschell:crosspartitionindex","ref":"crosspartitionindex","sha":"b22a55a78c9f10b1e81eb60513c2b594e64dff9d","user":{"login":"bschell","id":8600774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDA3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8600774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell","html_url":"https://github.com/bschell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":223274629,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjMyNzQ2Mjk=","name":"incubator-hudi","full_name":"bschell/incubator-hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bschell","id":8600774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MDA3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8600774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell","html_url":"https://github.com/bschell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bschell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bschell/incubator-hudi","description":"Upserts

 What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdd support for hive style partitioning\r\nJira: https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-353\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Add a new option in Spark datasource named HIVE_STYLE_PARTITIONING_FILED_OPT_KEY which indicates whether using hive style partitioning or not. By default this option is false (not use)*\r\n  - *Modify key generators to support this option when generating partition path*\r\n  - *Also, if using hive style partitioning, instead of scanning the dataset and manually adding/updating all partitions, we can use \"MSCK REPAIR TABLE <table_name>\" to automatically sync all the partition info with Hive MetaStore*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added additional test cases in TestDataSourceDefaults to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

[HUDI-308] Avoid Renames for tracking state transitions of all actions on dataset\r\n\r\nWith this PR,  Hudi Timeline management no longer uses rename to mark state transitions.  As renames can be non-atomic in some cloud stores, this PR addresses this issue in a clean way.\r\n\r\nRelated Changes:\r\n\r\n1.  Introduce new metadata layout version to Hudi table properties and use this to determine if renames should be used or not while writing. Any existing table created prior to 0.5.1 will preserve old semantics. Newer tables that are created after 0.5.1 will automatically avoid renames. Hudi Query Engine integration should be able to handle both cases. We expect the deployment to first upgrade query engines before upgrading writer\r\n\r\n2. As the new format enforces write once semantics, there is no longer any need to write compaction and cleaner plan in both places (.hoodie and .hoodie/.aux). Code changes handles this\r\n\r\n3. Commits/DeltaCommits also follow requested -> inflight -> completed state transitions. Rollback for \"requested\" state (failure during index lookup) is trivial as no side-effects happened. \r\n\r\n4. Commit Archiving handles the case of intermediate state files also being present
