What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the SerializableConfiguration, which makes the Hadoop configuration serializable is private. This makes it public, with a developer annotation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMany data source depend on the Hadoop configuration which may have specific components on the driver. Inside of Spark's own DataSourceV2 implementations this is frequently used (Parquet, Json, Orc, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis provides a new developer API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo new tests are added as this only exposes a previously developed & thoroughly used + tested component.","created_at":"2019-09-18T23:41:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T16:21:43Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T05:39:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c84d6bb185d5eae176cf76a12a71682e5c73c36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of the [review comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25706#discussion_r321923311).\r\n\r\nThis patch unifies the default wait time to be 10 seconds as it would fit most of UTs (as they have smaller timeouts) and doesn't bring additional latency since it will return if the condition is met.\r\n\r\nThis patch doesn't touch the one which waits 100000 milliseconds (100 seconds), to not break anything unintentionally, though I'd rather questionable that we really need to wait for 100 seconds.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt simplifies the test code and get rid of various heuristic values on timeout.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI build will test the patch, as it would be the best environment to test the patch (builds are running there).","created_at":"2019-09-18T22:39:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T07:08:11Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T06:12:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2644bc281c34ecc9a81569f3ad2bb5a42cad543","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support special timestamp and date values introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25716 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25708 only when the SQL config `spark.sql.dialect` is set to `PostgreSQL`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe special values are PostgreSQL specific feature. It should be supported under a config to avoid performance penalties and potential impact on user apps.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, special date/timestamp values like `epoch`, `now`, today`, tomorrow`, `yesterday` are supported only in the PostgreSQL dialect.\r\n\r\nIn the Spark dialect (the default dialect):\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.dialect=Spark;\r\nspark.sql.dialect\tSpark\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'today';\r\nError in query: \r\nCannot parse the TIMESTAMP value: today(line 1, pos 7)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect timestamp'today'\r\n-------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the PostgreSQL dialect:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.dialect=PostgreSQL;\r\nspark.sql.dialect\tPostgreSQL\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'today';\r\n2019-09-18 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing test suite `TimestampFormatterSuite`, `DateTimeUtilsSuite` and `Csv`/`JsonFunctionsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-18T18:14:50Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T19:57:33Z","closed_at":"2019-09-27T17:36:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58ca02546a70d2b730a49b29ebfb591ff107bb20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25834/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25834/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25834/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/94abaeaed5e7140a28e3784f5a7e5c89022f0eda","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:special-values-under-config","ref":"special-values-under-config","sha":"94abaeaed5e7140a28e3784f5a7e5c89022f0eda","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative proposal to #25822 and #25651. The problem we're trying to solve is that when a catalog doesn't exist when using a data source, there is no good way to create a V2 table with partitioning and table property information. Spark users have been using data source options to connect to such data sources such as Kafka, JDBC tables through data source options, and it should be possible to continue to create tables as such.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a couple interfaces: `SupportsCreateTable` and `SupportsIdentifierTranslation`. `SupportsCreateTable` are the parts that existed in `TableCatalog` that are related to the creation/dropping of tables. This is pulled out, and `TableCatalog` extends this interface. `SupportsIdentifierTranslation` is a way for data sources to go from data source options to an internal identifier that can be used to describe how to access that table. A `TableProvider` can extend `SupportsIdentifierTranslation` and `SupportsCreateTable` to be able to support the creation of tables without requiring an explicit catalog.\r\n\r\nThis would:\r\n 1. Fix the behavior for `DataFrameWriter.save` when passing in partitioning information to data sources\r\n 2. Allow `ErrorIfExists` and `Ignore` to be supported for `DataFrameWriter.save`\r\n 3. Open the path for supporting path based tables in `DataFrameWriterV2`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`DataFrameWriter.save` is broken for all data sources that want to get partitioning information and support different `SaveMode`s that migrate from DataSource V1 to V2 APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe behavior of a DataSource that used to be DataSource V1 in Spark 2.4 can behave identically with DataSource V2 in Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWill add tests after comments\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-18T16:42:38Z","updated_at":"2019-11-16T02:45:11Z","closed_at":"2019-11-11T19:55:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe634e3e5bac12d7004e9ef013d37c748c939840","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25833/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25833/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25833/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e48a5c490334a33f3edade649d1ed8cefaf672d0","head":{"label":"brkyvz:radicalV2","ref":"radicalV2","sha":"e48a5c490334a33f3edade649d1ed8cefaf672d0","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrevious comment was true for Apache Spark 2.3.0. The 2.4.0 release brought multiple watermark policy and therefore stating that the 'min' is always chosen is misleading.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the comments about multiple watermark policy. They aren't true anymore since in case of multiple watermarks, we can configure which one will be applied to the query. This change was brought with Apache Spark 2.4.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt introduces some confusion about the real execution of the commented code. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe tests weren't added because the change is only about the documentation level.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr is to propagate all the SQL configurations to executors in `SQLQueryTestSuite`. When the propagation enabled in the tests, a potential bug below becomes apparent;\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE num_data (id int, val decimal(38,10)) USING parquet;\r\n....\r\n select sum(udf(CAST(null AS Decimal(38,0)))) from range(1,4): QueryOutput(select sum(udf(CAST(null AS Decimal(38,0)))) from range(1,4),struct<>,java.lang.IllegalArgumentException\r\n[info]   requirement failed: MutableProjection cannot use UnsafeRow for output data types: decimal(38,0)) (SQLQueryTestSuite.scala:380)\r\n``` \r\nThe root culprit is that `InterpretedMutableProjection` has incorrect validation in the interpreter mode: `validExprs.forall { case (e, _) => UnsafeRow.isFixedLength(e.dataType) }`. This validation should be the same with the condition (`isMutable`) in `HashAggregate.supportsAggregate`: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/aggregate/HashAggregateExec.scala#L1126\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fixes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue brought by [SPARK-21870](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21870): when generating code for parameter type, it doesn't consider array type in javaType. At least we have one, Spark should generate code for BinaryType as `byte[]`, but Spark create the code for BinaryType as `[B` and generated code fails compilation.\r\n\r\nBelow is the generated code which failed compilation (Line 380):\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* 380 */   private void agg_doAggregate_count_0([B agg_expr_1_1, boolean agg_exprIsNull_1_1, org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow agg_unsafeRowAggBuffer_1) throws java.io.IOException {\r\n/* 381 */     // evaluate aggregate function for count\r\n/* 382 */     boolean agg_isNull_26 = false;\r\n/* 383 */     long agg_value_28 = -1L;\r\n/* 384 */     if (!false && agg_exprIsNull_1_1) {\r\n/* 385 */       long agg_value_31 = agg_unsafeRowAggBuffer_1.getLong(1);\r\n/* 386 */       agg_isNull_26 = false;\r\n/* 387 */       agg_value_28 = agg_value_31;\r\n/* 388 */     } else {\r\n/* 389 */       long agg_value_33 = agg_unsafeRowAggBuffer_1.getLong(1);\r\n/* 390 */\r\n/* 391 */       long agg_value_32 = -1L;\r\n/* 392 */\r\n/* 393 */       agg_value_32 = agg_value_33 + 1L;\r\n/* 394 */       agg_isNull_26 = false;\r\n/* 395 */       agg_value_28 = agg_value_32;\r\n/* 396 */     }\r\n/* 397 */     // update unsafe row buffer\r\n/* 398 */     agg_unsafeRowAggBuffer_1.setLong(1, agg_value_28);\r\n/* 399 */   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere wasn't any test for HashAggregateExec specifically testing this, but randomized test in ObjectHashAggregateSuite could encounter this and that's why ObjectHashAggregateSuite is flaky.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout the fix, generated code from HashAggregateExec may fail compilation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new UT. Without the fix, newly added UT fails.","created_at":"2019-09-18T13:04:52Z","updated_at":"2019-09-21T08:07:15Z","closed_at":"2019-09-21T07:29:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a76d80baf7e2ebbacc38349173eb98e3f069784","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25830/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25830/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25830/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c00a2b5386f318fbbded9e7f7e1daee7782758b","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-29140","ref":"SPARK-29140","sha":"4c00a2b5386f318fbbded9e7f7e1daee7782758b","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRefactored SQL-related benchmark and made them depend on `SqlBasedBenchmark`. In particular, creation of Spark session are moved into `override def getSparkSession: SparkSession`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis should simplify maintenance of SQL-based benchmarks by reducing the number of dependencies. In the future, it should be easier to refactor & extend all SQL benchmarks by changing only one trait. Finally, all SQL-based benchmarks will look uniformly. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running the modified

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe already have found and fixed the correctness issue before when RDD output is INDETERMINATE. One missing part is sampling-based RDD. This kind of RDDs is order sensitive to its input. A sampling-based RDD with unordered input, should be INDETERMINATE.\r\n\r\nNote that this is backport of original PR to branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA sampling-based RDD with unordered input is just like MapPartitionsRDD with isOrderSensitive parameter as true. The RDD output can be different after a rerun. \r\n\r\nIt is a problem in ML applications.\r\n\r\nIn ML, sample is used to prepare training data. ML algorithm fits the model based on the sampled data. If rerun tasks of sample produce different output during model fitting, ML results will be unreliable and also buggy.\r\n\r\nEach sample is random output, but once you sampled, the output should be determinate.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPreviously, a sampling-based RDD can possibly come with different output after a rerun.\r\nAfter this patch, sampling-based RDD is INDETERMINATE. For an INDETERMINATE map stage, currently Spark scheduler will re-try all the tasks of the failed stage.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-18T03:38:44Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:37:43Z","closed_at":"2019-09-18T20:08:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31214b67c73ebbbc5a4fa3c4302c1f70ac9bf3ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe add a new interface `SupportsCreateTable` to support the passing of partitioning transforms and table properties for tables that can be created without the existence of a catalog. Traditionally, data sources were passed all necessary information to define a table through the options in DataFrameWriter in conjunction with `save`.\r\n\r\nThrough this new interface, we can continue to perform the necessary checks for SaveMode.ErrorIfExists and SaveMode.Ignore through `save` for V2 tables. For example, a file based data source such as parquet can check if the target directory is empty or not as part of the `SupportsCreateTable.canCreateTable` to support these save modes. In addition, if metadata is available for a table (e.g. the schema of a jdbc data source would be available), the data source can check if the correct schema and partitioning transforms have been provided as part of the `SupportsCreateTable.buildTable` if a table already exists for the given options. The `buildTable` method also takes in table properties. While this isn't available for save, they can be provided through the DataFrameWriterV2 API.\r\n\r\nThoughts about DataFrameWriterV2:\r\nI'm also thinking that there could be a separate API that can potentially go from and to `options <-> Identifier`. This can make sure that these data sources can also leverage the DFWriterV2 API without requiring a catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently partitioning and bucketing information cannot be passed through for DataSources that migrate to DataSource V2 through the DataFrameWriter.save method which is one of the most commonly used methods used in Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis adds a new interface `SupportsCreateTable` which DataSource developers can implement as part of their `TableProvider` interface to support the creation of tables when a catalog is not available.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests in DataSourceV2DataFrameSuite","created_at":"2019-09-17T22:11:29Z","updated_at":"2019-11-16T02:45:05Z","closed_at":"2019-11-11T19:55:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee6c9683487fc7dbc0894f9a369931ad57a669e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f1aabaa0b27825b74cc16388152ec6d127d79f2","head":{"label":"brkyvz:radical","ref":"radical","sha":"5f1aabaa0b27825b74cc16388152ec6d127d79f2","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSupport for dot product with:\r\n- `ml.linalg.Vector`\r\n- `ml.linalg.Vectors`\r\n- `mllib.linalg.Vector`\r\n- `mllib.linalg.Vectors`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDot product is useful for feature engineering and scoring.  BLAS routines are already there, just a wrapper is needed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo user facing changes, just some new functionality.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTests were written and added to the appropriate `VectorSuites` classes.  They can be quickly run with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsbt \"mllib-local/testOnly org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.VectorsSuite\"\r\nsbt \"mllib/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded new benchmarks for `make_date()` and `make_timestamp()` to detect performance issues, and figure out functions speed on foldable arguments.\r\n- `make_date()` is benchmarked on fully foldable arguments. \r\n- `make_timestamp()` is benchmarked on corner case `60.0`, foldable time fields and foldable date.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo find out inputs where `make_date()` and `make_timestamp()` have performance problems. This should be useful in the future optimizations of the functions and users apps.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the benchmark and manually checking generated dates/timestamps.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-17T08:10:13Z","updated_at":"2019-10-05T19:17:57Z","closed_at":"2019-09-17T22:09:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05ea1d273de8aa9b8ed5f386aac1b0c50d98f7c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cc8061fd7b09c6d55632d39282c5a562ede1f009","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:make_datetime-benchmark","ref":"make_datetime-benchmark","sha":"cc8061fd7b09c6d55632d39282c5a562ede1f009","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes adding new feature to KVStore, snapshot (dump) & restore. The structure of snapshot file is also described to the design doc, but it's alike the structure of delta/snapshot file in HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider.\r\n\r\nHere's the format of snapshot file. The file is in binary format, and follows the way how DataOutputStream writes the types of “int” and “byte[]”, hence it follows “big-endian” when writing “int” type of value.\r\n\r\n* write(int) : https://github.com/jdk-mirror/openjdk8/blob/d15d915ceb0f6a5bfab067a23a9e4a674dac3da8/java/io/DataOutputStream.java#L187-L202\r\n* write(byte[]) : https://github.com/jdk-mirror/openjdk8/blob/master/java/io/FilterOutputStream.java#L80-L127\r\n\r\nThe file will start with metadata information, as KVStore has at most one metadata object being stored.\r\n\r\n> the length of metadata class name (int) | metadata class name (byte[]) | the length of serialized metadata object (int) | serialized metadata object (byte[]) | -2 (int)\r\n\r\nIf there's no metadata stored in KVStore, the length of metadata class name would be -2, which denotes following fields will not be presented.\r\n\r\nAnd the file will contain normal objects for each type which format is below:\r\n\r\n> the length of class name (int) | class name (byte[]) | the length of `#1` serialized object (int) | `#1` serialized object (byte[]) | ... (`#2`, `#3`, ...) | -2 (int)\r\n\r\nAbove format will be repeated for each type, and when no object is left for dumping, we simply put -1 in the place where the length of class name is expected to mark the end of file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe new feature will be used as a building block for [SPARK-28870](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28870). The patch is intended to be separate with the issue, as I would like to make each PR smaller.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as KVStore interface is defined as `@Private`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new UTs.","created_at":"2019-09-17T03:35:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T07:58:47Z","closed_at":"2020-01-26T07:58:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d0118d2ceb966b6d10068707c6bf0fba4f8d47c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`PipedRDD` will invoke `stdinWriterThread.interrupt()` at task completion, and `obj.wait` will get `InterruptedException`. However, there exists a possibility which the thread termination gets delayed because the thread starts from `obj.wait()` with that exception. To prevent test flakiness, we need to use `eventually`. Also, This PR fixes the typo in code comment and variable name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n```\r\n- stdin writer thread should be exited when task is finished *** FAILED ***\r\n  Some(Thread[stdin writer for List(cat),5,]) was not empty (PipedRDDSuite.scala:107)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.7/6867/testReport/junit/org.apache.spark.rdd/PipedRDDSuite/stdin_writer_thread_should_be_exited_when_task_is_finished/\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual. \r\n\r\nWe can reproduce the same failure like Jenkins if we catch `InterruptedException` and sleep longer than the `eventually` timeout inside the test code. The following is the example to reproduce it.\r\n```scala\r\nval nums = sc.makeRDD(Array(1, 2, 3, 4), 1).map { x =>\r\n  try {\r\n    obj.synchronized {\r\n      obj.wait() // make the thread waits here.\r\n    }\r\n  } catch {\r\n    case ie: InterruptedException =>\r\n      Thread.sleep(15000)\r\n      throw ie\r\n  }\r\n  x\r\n}\r\n```","created_at":"2019-09-16T23:23:22Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T16:09:03Z","closed_at":"2019-09-17T11:21:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"877229dfdbe66f4e4ca305b29a37b321c8a2b3ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCheck schema fields to see if they contain the exact column name, add to error message in DataSet#resolve\r\n\r\nAdd test for extra error message piece\r\n\r\nAdds an additional check in `DataSet#resolve`, in the else clause (i.e. column not resolved), that appends a suffix to the error message for the `AnalysisException` if that column name is literally found in the schema fields, to suggest to the user that it might need to be quoted via backticks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nForgetting to quote such column names is a common occurrence for new Spark users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo (other than the extra suffix on the error message).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`test` was run for `core` in `sbt`, and passed.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-16T21:37:01Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T01:36:03Z","closed_at":"2019-10-01T01:35:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4331b6f36b0b0510748803b73b7d3c01cbc5db0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen InSet generates Java switch-based code, if the input set is empty, we don't generate switch condition, but a simple expression that is default case of original switch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSPARK-26205 adds an optimization to InSet that generates Java switch condition for certain cases. When the given set is empty, it is possibly that codegen causes compilation error:\r\n \r\n```\r\n[info] - SPARK-29100: InSet with empty input set *** FAILED *** (58 milliseconds)                                      \r\n[info]   Code generation of input[0, int, true] INSET () failed:                                                                        \r\n[info]   org.codehaus.janino.InternalCompilerException: failed to compile: org.codehaus.janino.InternalCompilerException: Compiling \"GeneratedClass\" in \"generated.java\": Compiling \"apply(java.lang.Object _i)\"; apply(java.lang.Object _i): Operand stack inconsistent at offset 45: Previous size 0, now 1                                                                                                           \r\n[info]   org.codehaus.janino.InternalCompilerException: failed to compile: org.codehaus.janino.InternalCompilerException: Compiling \"GeneratedClass\" in \"generated.java\": Compiling \"apply(java.lang.Object _i)\"; apply(java.lang.Object _i): Operand stack inconsistent at offset 45: Previous size 0, now 1                                                                                                           \r\n[info]         at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeGenerator$.org$apache$spark$sql$catalyst$expressions$codegen$CodeGenerator$$doCompile(CodeGenerator.scala:1308)                                                                                        \r\n[info]         at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeGenerator$$anon$1.load(CodeGenerator.scala:1386)               \r\n[info]         at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeGenerator$$anon$1.load(CodeGenerator.scala:1383)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Previously, when users have InSet against an empty set, generated code causes compilation error.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n1. After https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21599, if the option \"spark.sql.failOnIntegralTypeOverflow\" is enabled, all the Binary Arithmetic operator will used the exact version function.\r\nHowever, only `Add`/`Substract`/`Multiply` has a corresponding exact function in java.lang.Math . When the option \"spark.sql.failOnIntegralTypeOverflow\" is enabled, a runtime exception \"BinaryArithmetics must override either exactMathMethod or genCode\" is thrown if the other Binary Arithmetic operators are used, such as \"Divide\", \"Remainder\".\r\nThe exact math method should be called only when there is a corresponding function in `java.lang.Math`\r\n2. Revise the log output of casting to `Int`/`Short`\r\n3. Enable `spark.sql.failOnIntegralTypeOverflow` for pgSQL tests in `SQLQueryTestSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Fix the bugs of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21599\r\n2. The test case of pgSQL intends to check the overflow of integer/long type. We should enable `spark.sql.failOnIntegralTypeOverflow`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test.","created_at":"2019-09-16T12:47:31Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T08:59:40Z","closed_at":"2019-09-18T08:59:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ac41bfad3f48add6c6e0b5ac35212878fd51e21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25804/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25804/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25804/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5674e40dc876cef12e5ed1627ecbe496daaad38","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:enableIntegerOverflowInSQLTest","ref":"enableIntegerOverflowInSQLTest","sha":"c5674e40dc876cef12e5ed1627ecbe496daaad38","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25638 to switch `scala-library` from `test` dependency to `compile` dependency in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the bug regarding NPE in SQLConf.get, which is only possible when SparkContext._dagScheduler is null due to stopping SparkContext. The logic doesn't seem to consider active SparkContext could be in progress of stopping.\r\n\r\nNote that it can't be encountered easily as SparkContext.stop() blocks the main thread, but there're many cases which SQLConf.get is accessed concurrently while SparkContext.stop() is executing - users run another threads, or listener is accessing SQLConf.get after dagScheduler is set to null (this is the case what I encountered.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe bug brings NPE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPrevious patch #25753 was tested with new UT, and due to disruption with other tests in concurrent test run, the test is excluded in this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEven we set spark.history.fs.numReplayThreads to a large number, such as 30.\r\nThe history server still replays logs slowly. \r\nWe found that, if there is a straggler in a batch of replay tasks, all the other threads will wait for this \r\nstraggler.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we create processing to save the logs which are being replayed.\r\nSo that

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch ensures accessing recorded values in listener is always after letting listeners fully process all events. To ensure this, this patch adds new class to hide these values and access with methods which will ensure above condition. Without this guard, two threads are running concurrently - 1) listeners process thread 2) test main thread - and race condition would occur.\r\n\r\nThat's why we also see very odd thing, error message saying condition is met but test failed:\r\n```\r\n- Barrier task failures from the same stage attempt don't trigger multiple stage retries *** FAILED ***\r\n  ArrayBuffer(0) did not equal List(0) (DAGSchedulerSuite.scala:2656)\r\n```\r\nwhich means verification failed, and condition is met just before constructing error message.\r\n\r\nThe guard is properly placed in many spots, but missed in some places. This patch enforces that it can't be missed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUT fails intermittently and this patch will address the flakyness.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UT. \r\n\r\nAlso made the flaky tests artificially failing via applying 50ms of sleep on each onXXX method. \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-07 at 7 44 15 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/64465178-1747ad00-d146-11e9-92f6-f4ed4a1f4b08.png)\r\n\r\nI found 3 methods being failed. (They've marked as X. Just ignore ! as they failed on waiting listener in given timeout and these tests don't deal with these recorded values - it uses other timeout value 1000ms than 10000ms for this listener so affected via side-effect.)\r\n\r\nWhen I applied same in this patch all tests marked as X passed.","created_at":"2019-09-15T05:57:45Z","updated_at":"2019-09-15T12:02:13Z","closed_at":"2019-09-15T08:04:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d12cb43ad59908a1a4fdfa492aca6e2215c8f7d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #24088 to avoid CCE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen we run YarnSchedulerBackendSuite, the class path seems to be made from the classes folder(`resource-managers/yarn/target/scala-2.12/classes`) instead of jar (`resource-managers/yarn/target/spark-yarn_2.12-*-SNAPSHOT.jar`) . `ui.getHandlers` is in spark-core and its loaded from spark-core.jar which is shaded and hence refers to `org.spark_project.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler`\r\n\r\nHere in  org.apache.spark.scheduler.cluster.YarnSchedulerBackend, as its not shaded, it expects org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler\r\n\r\nRefer discussion  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27122?focusedCommentId=16792318&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16792318\r\n\r\nHence as a fix, org.apache.spark.ui.WebUI must only return a wrapper class instance or references so that Jetty classes can be avoided in getters which are accessed outside spark-core\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-27122](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24088) fixes `ClassCastException` at `yarn` module by introducing `DelegatingServletContextHandler`. Initially, this was discovered with JDK9+, but the class path issues affected JDK8 environment, too. After [SPARK-28709](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25439), I also hit the similar issue at `streaming` module. \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `streaming` module by adding `getContextPath` to `DelegatingServletContextHandler` and using it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we test `streaming` module independently, it fails like the following.\r\n```\r\n$ build/mvn test -pl streaming\r\n...\r\nUISeleniumSuite:\r\n- attaching and detaching a Streaming tab *** FAILED ***\r\n  java.lang.ClassCastException: org.sparkproject.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler cannot be cast to org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.ServletContextHandler\r\n...\r\nTests: succeeded 337, failed 1, canceled 0, ignored 1, pending 0\r\n*** 1 TEST FAILED ***\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the modified tests. And do the following manually.\r\nSince you can observe this when you run `streaming` module test only (instead of running all), you need to install the changed `core` module and use it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ java -version\r\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_222\"\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 1.8.0_222-b10)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (AdoptOpenJDK)(build 25.222-b10, mixed mode)\r\n$ build/mvn install -DskipTests\r\n$ build/mvn test -pl streaming\r\n```","created_at":"2019-09-15T02:36:46Z","updated_at":"2019-09-15T17:16:31Z","closed_at":"2019-09-15T17:15:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86b7f28c374255352658a59c2fe042033dea644b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the bug regarding NPE in SQLConf.get, which is only possible when SparkContext._dagScheduler is null due to stopping SparkContext. The logic doesn't seem to consider active SparkContext could be in progress of stopping.\r\n\r\nNote that it can't be encountered easily as SparkContext.stop() blocks the main thread, but there're many cases which SQLConf.get is accessed concurrently while SparkContext.stop() is executing - users run another threads, or listener is accessing SQLConf.get after dagScheduler is set to null (this is the case what I encountered.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe bug brings NPE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPrevious patch #25753 was tested with new UT, and due to disruption with other tests in concurrent test run, the test is excluded in this patch.","created_at":"2019-09-14T13:30:23Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T01:35:13Z","closed_at":"2019-09-15T18:05:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"44cb3e094495bc33a1fc937ad758d904cc62405b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25790/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25790/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25790/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db247879a92200c2ec34b7229c0281cd593e10b2","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-29046-v2","ref":"SPARK-29046-v2","sha":"db247879a92200c2ec34b7229c0281cd593e10b2","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFitting ALS model can be failed due to nondeterministic input data. Currently the failure is thrown by an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException which is not explainable for end users what is wrong in fitting.\r\n\r\nThis patch catches this exception and rethrows a more explainable one, when the input data is nondeterministic.\r\n\r\nBecause we may not exactly know the output deterministic level of RDDs produced by user code, this patch also adds a note to Scala/Python/R ALS document about the training data deterministic level.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was observed during fitting ALS model. It was caused by mismatching between in/out user/item blocks during computing ratings.\r\n\r\nIf the training RDD output is nondeterministic, when fetch failure is happened, rerun part of training RDD can produce inconsistent user/item blocks.\r\n\r\nThis patch is needed to notify users ALS fitting on nondeterministic input.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. When fitting ALS model on nondeterministic input data, previously if rerun happens, users would see ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException caused by mismatch between In/Out user/item blocks.\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, a SparkException with more clear message will be thrown, and original ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is wrapped.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested on development cluster.","created_at":"2019-09-14T04:43:58Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:22:55Z","closed_at":"2019-09-18T14:22:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc7916b0f9727f60e81038531aa7f0a6005ebf24","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ed2d32abe2d1af61a09fa09a48667cd8a1d0010c","head":{"label":"viirya:als-indeterminate-input","ref":"als-indeterminate-input","sha":"ed2d32abe2d1af61a09fa09a48667cd8a1d0010c","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

use of `SerializationUtils.clone` with new `Utils.cloneProperties` method\r\nAdd benchmark + results showing dramatic speed up for effectively equivalent functionality.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhile I am not sure that SerializationUtils.clone is a performance issue in production, I am sure that it is overkill for the task it is doing (providing a distinct copy of a `Properties` object).\r\nThis PR provides a benchmark showing the dramatic improvement over the clone operation and replaces uses of `SerializationUtils.clone` on `Properties` with the more specialized `Utils.cloneProperties`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nStrings are immutable so there is no reason to serialize and deserialize them, it just creates extra garbage.\r\nThe only functionality that would be changed is the unsupported insertion of non-String objects into the spark local properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Pass the Jenkins with the existing tests.\r\n2. Since this is a performance improvement PR, manually run the benchmark.","created_at":"2019-09-13T23:09:50Z","updated_at":"2019-09-15T07:28:40Z","closed_at":"2019-09-15T07:28:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d0f2a0ec9caa0d3c5485fca81ada0b473a3f54f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExplicit calling `System.exit` after user's main code runs. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27812\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27927\r\n\r\nIf there are non-daemon threads running, the JVM won't call `ShutdownHook` after the driver's main exits. This means that any job running on kubernetes that doesn't explicitly call `SparkSession#stop` will hang. I believe that expecting users to include this to every job is unreasonable since they also need to remember to add an `UncaughtExceptionHandler`. If there's no exception handler, any exception thrown on the driver's side will also hang the process.\r\n\r\nSince I'm not that familiar with spark's codebase, this could be a terrible idea and I'm hopping that some of you guys could propose a better solution if that's the case. My educated guess is that there's no expectation that the application will continue to run after the declared main, the only difference is that we're now calling `System.exit` so shutdown hooks run independently of random non daemon threads.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that no. It does not introduce something that the user should notice(besides the fix)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTook `SparkPI` example and removed the `spark.stop()` call. Expected behaviour is that the driver exits after the job, but it doesn't. This patch fixed this.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake r file extension check case insensitive for spark-submit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nspark-submit does not accept `.r` files as R scripts. Some codebases have r files that end with lowercase file extensions. It is inconvenient to use spark-submit with lowercase extension R files. The error is not very clear (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmitArguments.scala#L232). \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-submit

used to run R scripts with `.r` file extension.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mv examples/src/main/r/dataframe.R examples/src/main/r/dataframe.r\r\n$

the full spark-submit command in SparkSubmit#launchApplication\r\n\r\nAdding .python-version (pyenv file) to RAT exclusion list\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOriginal motivation [here](http://apache-spark-user-list.1001560.n3.nabble.com/Is-it-possible-to-obtain-the-full-command-to-be-invoked-by-SparkLauncher-td35144.html), expanded in the [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29070)..  In essence, we want to be able to log the full `spark-submit` command being constructed by `SparkLauncher`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is not possible to directly obtain this information from the `SparkLauncher` instance, which makes debugging and customer support more difficult.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`core` `sbt` tests were executed.  The `SparkLauncherSuite` (where I added assertions to an existing test) was also checked.  Within that, `testSparkLauncherGetError` is failing, but that appears not to have been caused by this change (failing for me even on the parent commit of c18f849d7667012597fe747448845d80a367b1bb).","created_at":"2019-09-12T17:30:44Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T18:42:51Z","closed_at":"2019-09-27T18:32:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb858b900fd48754394c5c759627473f64edf7cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend `ExtractBenchmark` and add new ones for:\r\n- `EXTRACT` and `DATE` as input column\r\n- the `DATE_PART` function and `DATE`/`TIMESTAMP` input column\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe `EXTRACT` expression is rebased on the `DATE_PART` expression by the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25410 where some of sub-expressions take `DATE` column as the input (`Millennium`, `Year` and etc.) but others require `TIMESTAMP` column (`Hour`, `Minute`). Separate benchmarks for `DATE` should exclude overhead of implicit conversions `DATE` <-> `TIMESTAMP`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it doesn't.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Regenerated results of `ExtractBenchmark`\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-12T07:06:53Z","updated_at":"2019-10-05T19:17:38Z","closed_at":"2019-09-12T12:32:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1120b6135aecbd57a8ecbc93ed2f797c8cf58123","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/766110ad07bc1a9911b80a179033df6ad9c924fb","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:date_part-benchmark","ref":"date_part-benchmark","sha":"766110ad07bc1a9911b80a179033df6ad9c924fb","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR exposes USE CATALOG/USE SQL commands as described in this [SPIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jEcvomPiTc5GtB9F7d2RTVVpMY64Qy7INCA_rFEd9HQ/edit#)\r\n\r\nIt also exposes `currentCatalog` in `CatalogManager`.\r\n\r\nFinally, it changes `SHOW NAMESPACES` and `SHOW TABLES` to use the current catalog if no catalog is specified (instead of default catalog).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is currently no mechanism to change current catalog/namespace thru SQL commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, you can perform the following:\r\n```scala\r\n// Sets the current catalog to 'testcat'\r\nspark.sql(\"USE CATALOG testcat\")\r\n\r\n// Sets the current catalog to 'testcat' and current namespace to 'ns1.ns2'.\r\nspark.sql(\"USE ns1.ns2 IN testcat\")\r\n\r\n// Now, the following will use 'testcat' as the current catalog and 'ns1.ns2' as the current namespace.\r\nspark.sql(\"SHOW NAMESPACES\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests.","created_at":"2019-09-12T04:52:04Z","updated_at":"2019-10-02T13:55:54Z","closed_at":"2019-10-02T13:55:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32baed141e4a585f6d0ef46379660d3a35136cb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84856190f5bf7f7865ce3428986cca61471c9845","head":{"label":"imback82:use_namespace","ref":"use_namespace","sha":"84856190f5bf7f7865ce3428986cca61471c9845","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAt Apache Spark 3.0.0, [SPARK-23429](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21221) added the ability to collect executor metrics via heartbeats and to expose it as a REST API. This PR aims to extend it to support `Prometheus` format additionally.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPrometheus.io is a CNCF project used widely with K8s.\r\n- https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. New web interfaces are added along with the existing JSON API.\r\n\r\n|              |                JSON End Point                    |            Prometheus End Point         | \r\n| ------- |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to simplify `Prometheus` support by adding `PrometheusServlet`. The main use cases are `K8s` and `Spark Standalone` cluster environments.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPrometheus.io is a CNCF project used widely with K8s.\r\n- https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus\r\n\r\nFor `Master/Worker/Driver`, `Spark JMX Sink` and `Prometheus JMX Converter` combination is used in many cases. One way to achieve that is having the followings.\r\n\r\n**JMX Sink (conf/metrics.properties)**\r\n```\r\n*.sink.jmx.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.JmxSink\r\n```\r\n\r\n**JMX Converter(conf/spark-env.sh)**\r\n- https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/prometheus/jmx/jmx_prometheus_javaagent/0.12.0/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.12.0.jar\r\n```\r\nexport SPARK_DAEMON_JAVA_OPTS=\r\n\"-javaagent:${PWD}/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-${JMX_PROMETHEUS_VERSION}.jar=\r\n${PORT_AGENT}:jmx_prometheus.yaml\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis agent approach requires `PORT_AGENT` additionally. Instead, this PR natively support `Prometheus` format exporting with reusing REST API port for the better UX.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. New web interfaces are added along with the existing JSON API.\r\n\r\n|              |                         JSON End Point                       |            Prometheus End Point          | \r\n|

tested?\r\n\r\nManually connect the new end-points with `curl`.\r\n\r\n**Setup (Master/Worker/Driver)**\r\nAdd the followings at `conf/metrics.properties` (`conf/metrics.properties.template` has these examples)\r\n```\r\n*.sink.prometheusServlet.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.PrometheusServlet\r\n*.sink.prometheusServlet.path=/metrics/prometheus\r\nmaster.sink.prometheusServlet.path=/metrics/master/prometheus\r\napplications.sink.prometheusServlet.path=/metrics/applications/prometheus\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModify the approach in `DataFrameNaFunctions.fillValue`, the new one uses `df.withColumns` which only address the columns need to be filled. After this change, there are no more ambiguous fileds detected for joined dataframe.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore this change, when you have a joined table that has the same field name from both original table, fillna will fail even if you specify a subset that does not include the 'ambiguous' fields.\r\n```\r\nscala> val df1 = Seq((\"f1-1\", \"f2\", null), (\"f1-2\", null, null), (\"f1-3\", \"f2\", \"f3-1\"), (\"f1-4\", \"f2\", \"f3-1\")).toDF(\"f1\", \"f2\", \"f3\")\r\nscala> val df2 = Seq((\"f1-1\", null, null), (\"f1-2\", \"f2\", null), (\"f1-3\", \"f2\", \"f4-1\")).toDF(\"f1\", \"f2\", \"f4\")\r\nscala> val df_join = df1.alias(\"df1\").join(df2.alias(\"df2\"), Seq(\"f1\"), joinType=\"left_outer\")\r\nscala> df_join.na.fill(\"\", cols=Seq(\"f4\"))\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Reference 'f2' is ambiguous, could be: df1.f2, df2.f2.;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, fillna operation will pass and give the right answer for a joined table.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nLocal test and newly added UT.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-12T03:22:49Z","updated_at":"2019-09-21T02:38:33Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T23:26:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf7c2bb988e4baaf827a0478b03bee180d3b13e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25768/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25768/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25768/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/59106dce05b97125c064950c67763ece4e3e19b6","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-29063","ref":"SPARK-29063","sha":"59106dce05b97125c064950c67763ece4e3e19b6","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the checks in the Analyzer require that V2 Tables have BATCH_WRITE defined for all tables that have V1 Write fallbacks. This is confusing as these tables may not have the V2 writer interface implemented yet. This PR adds this table capability to these checks.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this allows V2 tables to leverage the V1 APIs for DataFrameWriter.save if they do extend the V1_BATCH_WRITE capability. This way, these tables can continue to receive partitioning information and also perform checks for the existence of tables, and support all SaveModes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPartitioned saves through DataFrame.write are otherwise broken for V2 tables that support the V1\r\nwrite API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nV1WriteFallbackSuite","created_at":"2019-09-12T00:46:29Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T14:04:49Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T14:04:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20227d5c1f60bd39684cbc115aef0b833ab8030b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25767/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25767/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25767/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb396765335d92ed43584eb69d3fddb4dff02a9b","head":{"label":"brkyvz:bwcheck","ref":"bwcheck","sha":"cb396765335d92ed43584eb69d3fddb4dff02a9b","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a utility class `AdaptiveSparkPlanHelper` which provides methods related to tree traversal of an `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` plan. Unlike their counterparts in `TreeNode` or\r\n`QueryPlan`, these methods traverse down leaf nodes of adaptive plans, i.e., `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` and `QueryStageExec`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis utility class can greatly simplify tree traversal code for adaptive spark plans.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRefined `AdaptiveQueryExecSuite` with the help of the new utility methods.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-11T19:27:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T13:49:34Z","closed_at":"2019-09-12T13:49:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"704c3246c81df511b94305e219f7898b3aa7b6cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25764/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25764/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25764/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6401d9cf25e8a9d1aec96c9478fe01741de82f12","head":{"label":"maryannxue:aqe-utils","ref":"aqe-utils","sha":"6401d9cf25e8a9d1aec96c9478fe01741de82f12","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove `InsertIntoTable` and replace it's usage by `InsertIntoStatement`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`InsertIntoTable` and `InsertIntoStatement` are almost identical (except some namings). It doesn't make sense to keep 2 identical plans. After the removal of `InsertIntoTable`, the analysis process becomes:\r\n1. parser creates `InsertIntoStatement`\r\n2. v2 rule `ResolveInsertInto` converts `InsertIntoStatement` to v2 commands.\r\n3. v1 rules like `DataSourceAnalysis` and `HiveAnalysis` convert `InsertIntoStatement` to v1 commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue of substituting aliases while collecting filters in  `PhysicalOperation.collectProjectsAndFilters`. When the `AttributeReference` in alias map differs from the `AttributeReference` in filter condition only in qualifier, it does not substitute alias and throws exception saying `key videoid#47L not found` in the following scenario.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[1] Project [userid#0]\r\n+- [2] Filter (isnotnull(videoid#47L) && NOT (videoid#47L = 30))\r\n   +- [3] Project [factorial(videoid#1) AS videoid#47L, userid#0]\r\n      +- [4] Filter (isnotnull(avebitrate#2) && (avebitrate#2 < 10))\r\n         +- [5] Relation[userid#0,videoid#1,avebitrate#2]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe need to use `AttributeMap` where the key is `AttributeReference`'s `ExprId` instead of `Map[Attribute, Expression]` while collecting and substituting aliases in `PhysicalOperation.collectProjectsAndFilters`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests were added in `TestPhysicalOperation` which reproduces the bug\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-11T15:15:00Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T04:07:30Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T04:02:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b75ae3302d7b7474793670966649bfbadeff48c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605297,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1Mjk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/OPTIMIZER","name":"OPTIMIZER","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25761/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25761/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25761/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/847c9ece22f6757162acac7b7a8981731f3573e5","head":{"label":"nikitagkonda:SPARK-29029-use-attributemap-for-aliasmap-in-physicaloperation","ref":"SPARK-29029-use-attributemap-for-aliasmap-in-physicaloperation","sha":"847c9ece22f6757162acac7b7a8981731f3573e5","user":{"login":"nikitagkonda","id":32120079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTIwMDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32120079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitagkonda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":207441903,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDc0NDE5MDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"nikitagkonda/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nikitagkonda","id":32120079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTIwMDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32120079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda","html_url":"https://github.com/nikitagkonda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikitagkonda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nikitagkonda/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nKafka consumers are cached. If delegation token is used and the token is expired, then exception is thrown. Such case new consumer is created in a Task retry with the latest delegation token. This can be enhanced by detecting the existence of a new delegation token. In this PR I'm detecting whether the token in the consumer is the same as the latest stored in the `UGI` (`targetServersRegex` must match not to create a consumer with another cluster's token).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt would be good to avoid Task retry to pick up the latest delegation token.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + new unit tests.\r\nAdditionally executed the following code snippet to measure `ensureConsumerHasLatestToken` time consumption:\r\n```\r\n    val startTimeNs = System.nanoTime()\r\n    for (i <- 0 until 10000) {\r\n      consumer.ensureConsumerHasLatestToken()\r\n    }\r\n    logInfo(s\"It took ${TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toMillis(System.nanoTime() - startTimeNs)} ms\" +\r\n      \" to call ensureConsumerHasLatestToken 10000 times\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here are the results:\r\n```\r\n19/09/11

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no migration section for PySpark, SparkCore and Structured Streaming.\r\nIt is difficult for users to know what to do when they upgrade.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to create create a \"Migration Guide\" tap at Spark documentation.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-11 at 7 02 05

PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/64689915-389ff480-d4ca-11e9-8c54-7f46095d0d23.png)\r\n\r\nThis page will contain migration guides for Spark SQL, PySpark, SparkR, MLlib, Structured Streaming and Core. Basically it is a refactoring.\r\n\r\nThere are some new information added, which I will leave a comment inlined for easier review.\r\n\r\n1. **MLlib**\r\n  Merge [ml-guide.html#migration-guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html#migration-guide) and [ml-migration-guides.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-migration-guides.html)\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    'docs/ml-guide.md'\r\n            ↓ Merge new/old migration guides\r\n    'docs/ml-migration-guide.md'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. **PySpark**\r\n  Extract PySpark specific items from https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-migration-guide-upgrade.html\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    'docs/sql-migration-guide-upgrade.md'\r\n           ↓ Extract PySpark specific items\r\n    'docs/pyspark-migration-guide.md'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. **SparkR**\r\n  Move [sparkr.html#migration-guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html#migration-guide) into a separate file, and extract from [sql-migration-guide-upgrade.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-migration-guide-upgrade.html)\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    'docs/sparkr.md'                     'docs/sql-migration-guide-upgrade.md'\r\n     Move migration guide section ↘     ↙ Extract SparkR specific items\r\n                     docs/sparkr-migration-guide.md \r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. **Core**\r\n  Newly created at `'docs/core-migration-guide.md'`. I skimmed resolved JIRAs at 3.0.0 and found some items to note.\r\n\r\n5. **Structured Streaming**\r\n  Newly created at `'docs/ss-migration-guide.md'`. I skimmed resolved JIRAs at 3.0.0 and found some items to note.\r\n \r\n6. **SQL**\r\n  Merged [sql-migration-guide-upgrade.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-migration-guide-upgrade.html) and [sql-migration-guide-hive-compatibility.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-migration-guide-hive-compatibility.html)\r\n    ```\r\n    'docs/sql-migration-guide-hive-compatibility.md'     'docs/sql-migration-guide-upgrade.md'\r\n     Move Hive compatibility section ↘                   ↙ Left over after filtering PySpark and SparkR items\r\n                                  'docs/sql-migration-guide.md'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order for users in production to effectively migrate to higher versions, and detect behaviour or breaking changes before upgrading and/or migrating.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, this changes Spark's documentation at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually build the doc. This can be verified as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd docs\r\nSKIP_API=1 jekyll build\r\nopen _site/index.html\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-11T10:25:15Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:17:58Z","closed_at":"2019-09-15T18:17:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18b223c3d59c82ce3f3ea243a6841bf42bb14459","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `Column.isInCollection()` with a large size collection will generate an expression with large size children expressions. This make analyzer and optimizer take a long time to run.\r\nIn this PR, in `isInCollection()` function, directly generate `InSet` expression, avoid generating too many children expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Column.isInCollection()` with a large size collection sometimes become a bottleneck when running sql.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually benchmark it in spark-shell:\r\n```\r\ndef testExplainTime(collectionSize: Int) = {\r\n        val df = spark.range(10).withColumn(\"id2\", col(\"id\") + 1)\r\n        val list = Range(0, collectionSize).toList\r\n        val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis() \r\n        df.where(col(\"id\").isInCollection(list)).where(col(\"id2\").isInCollection(list)).explain()\r\n        val elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime\r\n        println(s\"cost time: ${elapsedTime}ms\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen test on collection size 5, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, test result is:\r\n\r\ncollection size | explain time (before) | explain time (after)\r\n------ | ------ | ------\r\n5 | 26ms | 29ms\r\n10 | 30ms | 48ms\r\n100 | 104ms | 50ms\r\n1000 | 1202ms | 58ms\r\n10000 | 10012ms |

The logic doesn't seem to consider active SparkContext could be in progress of stopping.\r\n\r\nNote that it can't be encountered easily as `SparkContext.stop()` blocks the main thread, but there're many cases which SQLConf.get is accessed concurrently while SparkContext.stop() is executing - users run another threads, or listener is accessing SQLConf.get after dagScheduler is set to null (this is the case what I encountered.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe bug brings NPE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new UT to verify NPE doesn't occur.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe already have found and fixed the correctness issue before when RDD output is INDETERMINATE. One missing part is sampling-based RDD. This kind of RDDs is order sensitive to its input. A sampling-based RDD with unordered input, should be INDETERMINATE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA sampling-based RDD with unordered input is just like MapPartitionsRDD with isOrderSensitive parameter as true. The RDD output can be different after a rerun. \r\n\r\nIt is a problem in ML applications.\r\n\r\nIn ML, sample is used to prepare training data. ML algorithm fits the model based on the sampled data. If rerun tasks of sample produce different output during model fitting, ML results will be unreliable and also buggy.\r\n\r\nEach sample is random output, but once you sampled, the output should be determinate.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPreviously, a sampling-based RDD can possibly come with different output after a rerun.\r\nAfter this patch, sampling-based RDD is INDETERMINATE. For an INDETERMINATE map stage, currently Spark scheduler will re-try all the tasks of the failed stage.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-11T01:21:00Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:22:55Z","closed_at":"2019-09-13T21:07:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e5d7c032ea16887a4b434fe1cb867284e5686c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to allow `bytes` as an acceptable type for binary type for `createDataFrame`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`bytes` is a standard type for binary in Python. This should be respected in PySpark side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, _when specified type is binary_, we will allow `bytes` as a binary type. Previously this was not allowed in both Python 2 and Python 3 as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.createDataFrame([[b\"abcd\"]], \"col binary\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nin Python 3\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently we deal with different `ParsedStatement` in many places and write duplicated catalog/table lookup logic. In general the lookup logic is\r\n1. try look up the catalog by name. If no such catalog, and default catalog is not set, convert `ParsedStatement` to v1 command like `ShowDatabasesCommand`. Otherwise, convert `ParsedStatement` to v2 command like `ShowNamespaces`.\r\n2. try look up the table by name. If no such table, fail. If the table is a `V1Table`, convert `ParsedStatement` to v1 command like `CreateTable`. Otherwise, convert `ParsedStatement` to v2 command like `CreateV2Table`.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the code is duplicated we don't apply this lookup logic consistently. For example, we forget to consider the v2 session catalog in several places.\r\n\r\nThis PR centralizes the catalog/table lookup logic by 3 rules.\r\n1. `ResolveCatalogs` (in catalyst). This rule resolves v2 catalog from the multipart identifier in SQL statements, and convert the statement to v2 command if the resolved catalog is not session catalog. If the command needs to resolve the table (e.g. ALTER TABLE), put an `UnresolvedV2Table` in the command.\r\n2. `ResolveTables` (in catalyst). It resolves `UnresolvedV2Table` to `DataSourceV2Relation`.\r\n3. `ResolveSessionCatalog` (in sql/core). This rule is only effective if the resolved catalog is session catalog. For commands that don't need to resolve the table, this rule converts the statement to v1 command directly. Otherwise, it converts the statement to v1 command if the resolved table is v1 table, and convert to v2 command if the resolved table is v2 table. Hopefully we can remove this rule eventually when v1 fallback is not needed anymore.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nReduce duplicated code and make the catalog/table lookup logic consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

The former produces `GenericInternalRows`, while the latter produces `UnsafeRow`s. Both expressions extend the `CreateNameStructLike` trait.\r\n\r\nThe \"unsafe\" version was added in SPARK-9373 / #7689 to support structs in `GenerateUnsafeProjection` (this was fairly early in the Tungsten effort, circa mid-2015 / Spark 1.5.x). \r\n\r\nThis PR changes Spark so the UnsafeRow-based codepath is always used and removes the GenericRow-based path. For ease-of-review, I've broken this into two commits:\r\n\r\n- The first commit changes `CreateNamedStruct` to use the `CreateNamedStructUnsafe` implementation (producing `UnsafeRow`) and deletes `CreateNamedStructUnsafe`.\r\n- The second commit removes the  `CreateNameStructLike` trait (since at that point it only has a single implementation).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe old `CreateNamedStruct` code path allocated a fresh `GenericInternalRow` on every invocation, incurring object allocation and primitive-boxing performance overheads.\r\n\r\nI suspect that this can be a significant performance problem in code which uses `Dataset`s: Spark's `ExpressionEncoder` uses `CreateNamedStruct` for serializing / deserializing case classes, so the `GenericInternalRow` performance problems can impact typed Dataset operations (e.g. `.map()`).\r\n\r\nI spotted this while doing a deep-dive into Encoder-generated code.\r\n\r\nI think there's also code-simplification benefits: if we only have a single implementation of `CreateNamedStruct` then we're removing the possibility for bugs in case code authors pattern-match on concrete classes instead of the `CreateNamedStructLike` trait.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere is no expected user-facing behavioral change.\r\n\r\nHowever, there **is** an  binary-compatibility-breaking change due to the deletion of `CreateNamedStructUnsafe` and `CreateNamedStructLike`. I suspect that these were originally intended to be internal / private classes and therefore propose that this is an acceptable breaking change in Spark 3.x (since it seems pretty unlikely that Spark users would be directly using those internal interfaces).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI believe this is covered by Spark's existing tests. `CreateNamedStructUnsafe` is already used in `GenerateUnsafeProjection` and thus already had some pre-existing test coverage.
