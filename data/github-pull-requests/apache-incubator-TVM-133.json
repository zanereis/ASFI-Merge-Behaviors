TVMArray simply allocates a DLTensor which is a plain C type. This PR change that into a NDArray, which is reference counted and can be used as container in c++.\r\n\r\nThe TVMArray now is backed by the C++ NDArray::Container, and can pass back and forth in PackedFunc. The python NDArray argument is now passed as NDArray type.\r\n\r\nThe callee can also directly take out DLTensor* when NDArray is passed, which is compatible with the previous behavior. Moreover, the API allows the callee to take out NDArray from TVMArgs and capture that in the function(by automatically increasing ref count).  PackedFunc can now also return NDArray. \r\n\r\nThe NDArray::Container* is DLTensor* compatible, and can be directly viewed as DLTensor*.\r\n\r\n## Known Limitations\r\nNDArray is a reference counted type and cannot pass RPC boundary. When NDArray is passed as an argument as a remote function, the argument is downgraded to DLTensor*, so passing NDArray as argument still work if the remote function modifies the data content. Remote function cannot return NDArray.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-11T06:22:42Z","updated_at":"2018-07-12T01:31:30Z","closed_at":"2018-07-12T01:31:29Z","merged_at":"2018-07-12T01:31:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"eda20382479e884573f3bb1c66273e4fc52d0edf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/74bd284f88d65a3901bc6c05578e31bbddb38d6b","head":{"label":"tqchen:master","ref":"master","sha":"74bd284f88d65a3901bc6c05578e31bbddb38d6b","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqc

one common use mode of tvm is to use all the available cores on a system, as defined in [MaxConcurrency](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/cdfdda4e01d90f6ded9208ff2de9cc699f1beea8/src/runtime/sgx/trusted/threading_backend.cc#L60). On asymmetric or heterogeneous multicores (e.g., big.LITTLE), however, we may want to specify a subset of CPU cores (with a preference for the CPU core type).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new global function to change the runtime configuration `runtime.config_threadpool` which allows the user to specify a CPU type as well as the number of threads to use. \r\narguments: \r\n`mode` : `{big, little, default}`\r\n`nthreads`: `{0, 1, 2, ...}`\r\nMode will select the preferred CPU type (based on CPU clock rate). \"big\" will prefer higher clocked cores first, while \"little\" will prefer lower clocked cores first.  Choosing \"default\" will not change the CPU affinity preference order from the system's CPU id ordering.\r\nNthreads selects the number of CPUs to use, picking CPUs to use in the order specified by `mode`.\r\nIf a value of 0 is picked, all of the cores of the preferred `mode` will be used.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nSystem has 4x Cortex A-53 (LITTLE) + 2x Cortex A-72 (big).\r\ncpuid 0: LITTLE\r\ncpuid 1: LITTLE\r\ncpuid 2: LITTLE\r\ncpuid 3: LITTLE\r\ncpuid 4: big\r\ncpuid 5: big\r\n\r\n`config_threadpool(\"big\", 1)` -> changes affinity order to `[4,5,1,2,3]`, will use CPU 4\r\n`config_threadpool(\"big\", 2)` -> changes affinity order to `[4,5,1,2,3]`, will use CPUs 4, 5\r\n`config_threadpool(\"big\", 3)` -> changes affinity order to `[4,5,1,2,3]`, will use CPUs 4,5,0\r\n`config_threadpool(\"big\", 0)` -> changes affinity order to `[4,5,1,2,3]`, will use CPUs 4,5\r\n\r\n`config_threadpool(\"little\", 0)` ->leaves affinity order as  `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`, will use CPUs 0,1,2,3\r\n`config_threadpool(\"little\", 5)` ->leaves affinity order as  `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`, will use CPUs 0,1,2,3,4\r\n\r\n`config_threadpool(\"default\", 0)` ->leaves affinity order as  `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`, will use CPUs 0,1,2,3,4,5\r\n\r\nNote that if `config_threadpool` is not called, the default behavior remains the same as in current tvm.\r\n\r\nOn a few toy experiments, we can observe that restricting the runtime to 2x A-72 cores can actually outperform 4x A-53 _PLUS_ 2x A-72 cores due to the current static work partitioning scheme.\r\n\r\nmisc:\r\nI do not know the current standard for docstrings of `TVM_REGISTER_GLOBAL` functions, let me know where that should go.\r\n\r\nCurrently this scheme will fix CPU affinity once the runtime spawns the threads for execution. We can modify the scheme to support switching affinity dynamically within the same runtime instance, but this requires considering how we want to handle migrating existing threads, as the existing threading backend implementation only sets thread affinity at thread creation time.

SPIR-V codegen was not generating code compliant with the spec, which was manifesting in all of the vulkan unit tests failing on Windows 10 with a GTX 960 GPU. Specifically, whenever a vulkan kernel was invoked, it would only ever succeed in updating the first element of the input tensor.\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be due to the codegen not generating the `interface` list of `OpEntryPoint`. For the code that TVM generates, the `interface` list should contain both the workgroup id and the local invocation id. See https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/specs/1.0/SPIRV.html#OpEntryPoint for details.\r\n\r\nSPIRV-Tools has recently been updated to detect this situation (see https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/pull/1589), so one way to verify that TVM is generating correct code is to take the output of `get_source`, use `spirv-as` to generate a binary SPIR-V file, and then run a recent release of `spirv-val` on the binary file.\r\n\r\nThe fix in this PR does solve the problem, but I'm not sure if it's the best way of addressing this, so I'm definitely open to

add more robustness to android RPC to facilitate automated schedule optimization via autotvm.\r\n\r\nPreviously the android RPC app would crash if passed a bad schedule as the RPC server ran in the same process as the app (different thread). This PR moves the RPC service to an android service that runs in a separate process to provide process isolation.\r\n\r\nThere is also now a watchdog which periodically polls the RPC service to check if it is alive. The watchdog starts a new RPC service if a bad schedule crashed the service.\r\n\r\nThe watchdog also instructs the RPC service to check if it is currently in a session that has timed out (currently a hard timeout of 30 seconds is enforced). The RPC service kills itself in this case; the app will wait for a respawn from the watchdog. This step is necessary as some bad schedules have been found to leave OpenCL in a bad state where the entire process must be completely restarted while locking up the RPC service.","created_at":"2018-07-05T23:51:53Z","updated_at":"2018-07-08T01:51:23Z","closed_at":"2018-07-08T01:51:19Z","merged_at":"2018-07-08T01:51:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"275142ce069873909f33ccfa9517122b6a6230b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

Issue]( https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/1315)\r\n#https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/1315\r\n\r\nA debug framework for TVM Runtime.\r\nThe current version support the following:\r\n- [x]   Show fused graph summary in curses UI\r\n- [x]   Perform debug run and show node details including inputs & outputs tensors\r\n- [x]   Provide flexibility to run without debug option\r\n\r\n**Design**\r\n1. `debug_runtime.py ` : This is the extension of `graph_runtime.py`. If user enable the debug, then all the graph_runtime interfaces are controlled from here and  the data dumping will be maintained from here. The data dumping to different UX, whether curses or tensorboard is maintained from this file.\r\n\r\n2. `graph_runtime_debug.cc` : This is the extension of graph_runtime.cc file. To compile this file, need to change the make file USE_GRAPH_RUNTIME_DEBUG to ON\r\n\r\n3. `curses` :  This folder contains the curses framework. curses will do the data parsing and visualisation for various features like analyser, stepper & profiler.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation takes care of the following.\r\n- [x] No memory impact for normal run-time since the existing data structures are kept intact.\r\n- [x] No lib size impact for normal run-time, as all the debug modificatios are protected with compilation macro USE_GRAPH_RUNTIME_DEBUG.\r\n- [x] No execution time impact for normal run-time  as there are no change in the existing functions.\r\n- [x] Test case added for debug module creation and partial validation (run cant be tested since the curses ui will come up block the execution)\r\n- [x] The data logging and UX work independently, Output data logged into temporary folder and UX read this data and proceed visualisation.\r\n- [x] Tutorial on how to

PR allows having both SDAccel and other OpenCL platforms.\r\n\r\nWhen the target device is 'sdaccel', the runtime tries to use the Xilinx toolchain and find FPGA devices.  If it fails to find SDAccel environment, it falls back to other OpenCL platforms so that unittests can test sdaccel backend.\r\n\r\nWhen the target device is 'opencl', the runtime tries to find GPU and CPU devices.  The behavior is same as

we allow set a tag field to indicate the type of the compute op.
