adds support for detection of [Unix dump files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dump_(program)) (magic adapted from file(1) magic by Christos Zoulas). I also hand-crafted some minimal test files (magic-only + zero-bytes) for all variations.\r\n\r\nFor this patch I created two new mimetypes `x-tika-unix-dump-old` and `x-tika-unix-dump-new`. Ideally I imagine it might be helpful if Tika would also report on the sub-variations within those types (big-endian, little-endian, ufs2 and 16-bit), but I'm not sure what's the best way to do this. (Maybe by adding a `;version=`, but I don't think that's meant to be used like this).\r\n\r\nIf anyone has suggestions on a better way to do this I'd be happy to adapt  the patch

part of the changes introduced in 1.19 `determineMaxEntityExpansions` needs to read the `jdk.xml.entityExpansionLimit` System Property in order to overwrite the default value of 20, if it is set.\r\nThis is however by reading all System Properties with `System#getProperties()` and attempting to find the relevant key in the properties Object. The issue with this approach is that `System#getProperties()` requires:\r\n```\r\njava.util.PropertyPermission \"*\", \"read,write\"\r\n```\r\nwhich is an overly permissive one to allow for the given use case.\r\n\r\nA more sane approach, following the least privilege design principal would be to use `System.getProperty()` for the specific property that only requires\r\n```\r\njava.util.PropertyPermission \"jdk.xml.entityExpansionLimit\", \"read\"\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-21T13:45:05Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T20:35:19Z","closed_at":"2018-09-21T20:35:05Z","merged_at":"2018-09-21T20:35:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"8fee03ce17b43c72b3c2b7a5dc1b38f1be628dce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/250/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/250/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/250/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/67981dce07a59ed444306f1a32a47c9b216db101","head":{"label":"jkakavas:change-property-access","ref":"change-property-access","sha":"67981dce07a59ed444306f1a32a47c9b216db101","user":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149768288,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDk3NjgyODg=","name":"tika","full_name":"jkakavas/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkakavas","id":10281256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjgxMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10281256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas","html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkakavas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkakavas/tika","description":"Mirror

detection)\r\n\r\nStandard compliance is still not perfect, as some parts, such as page-reloading, do not fit well in TIKA.\r\n\r\nI am open to any remarks or suggestions concerning the code and am ready to rework it if necessary.\r\n\r\nFor a comparison to other encoding detectors, see:

AbstractPDF2XHTML.doOCROnCurrentPage to use the same DPI value\r\n(PDFParserConfig.ocrDPI) for both the PDF rendering and the image metadata.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the PDF was being rendered using ocrImageScale (default 2.0 ==\r\n144dpi) and then putting ocrDPI (default 300) in the image metadata.  Having\r\nthese two things be independent makes no sense, and is surely going to\r\nconfuse Tesseract when the image metadata does not match the data.\r\n\r\nThis change means that ocrDPI drives both values, and ocrImageScale is\r\nremoved.  This also switches from PDFRenderer.renderImage to\r\nPDFRenderer.renderImageWithDPI, but that's just a stub to make it clearer\r\nwhat's going on.\r\n\r\nThis change will have the side-effect that the temporary images between the\r\nPDF rendering and Tesseract will be 4x larger (144dpi to 300dpi).  This will\r\nhave a memory and temporary disk space impact, but it will ensure that the\r\nwhole pipeline uses 300dpi by default.  People who have memory constraints\r\nwill need to reduce ocrDPI and make the corresponding changes on the\r\nTesseract side.","created_at":"2018-04-02T19:15:44Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T21:33:22Z","closed_at":"2019-10-22T21:33:21Z","merged_at":"2019-10-22T21:33:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"849fc385e626d904c50c3338d4668f6ab44bd72a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/232/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/232/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/232/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/fe3df83b961dbdc0e4f5625ec7e1c8d2bce47db1","head":{"label":"NationalBI:TIKA-2624","ref":"TIKA-2624","sha":"fe3df83b961dbdc0e4f5625ec7e1c8d2bce47db1","user":{"login":"NationalBI","id":35704460,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA0NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35704460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI","html_url":"https://github.com/NationalBI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122264552,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjIyNjQ1NTI=","name":"tika","full_name":"NationalBI/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NationalBI","id":35704460,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA0NDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35704460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI","html_url":"https://github.com/NationalBI","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NationalBI/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NationalBI/tika","description":"Mirror

have found that a certain tiff that we manage is now reporting application/x-tar in Tika where it previously reported as a tiff (image/tiff). \r\n\r\nObserve this code in ArchiveStreamFactory, detect

   IOUtils.closeQuietly(tais);             }\r\nWhat if find is that most TIFs, when they get to tais.getNextTarEntry() fail with an exception (i.e fall into the \"simply not a tar\" case). However this tiff actually does NOT fail here. This somewhat makes sense as the internal structure of a fax compressed tifs as a tar-like structure\r\n\r\nNote, the CompositeDetector class eventually does recognize it as a proper tiff as it loops through its detectors in its detect method. It is detected as tiff in the MimeTypes class, which is one of the implementations of the Detector interface\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    public MediaType detect(InputStream input, Metadata metadata)\r\n\r\n            throws IOException {\r\n\r\n        MediaType type = MediaType.OCTET_STREAM;\r\n\r\n        for (Detector detector : getDetectors()) {\r\n\r\n            //short circuit via OverrideDetector\r\n\r\n            //can't rely on ordering because subsequent detector may\r\n\r\n            //change Override's to a specialization of Override's\r\n\r\n            if (detector instanceof OverrideDetector &&        metadata.get(TikaCoreProperties.CONTENT_TYPE_OVERRIDE) != null)\r\n\r\n{                 return detector.detect(input, metadata);             }\r\n            MediaType detected = detector.detect(input, metadata);\r\n\r\n            if (registry.isSpecializationOf(detected, type))\r\n\r\n{                 type = detected;             }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return type;\r\n\r\nHowever since Image/tiff isn't a specialization of application/x-tar it does not replace the type with tiff.\r\n\r\nMy fix was to add a  \"<sub-class-of type=\"application/x-tar\"/>\" to the definition for image/tiff in the tika-mimetypes.xml file\r\n\r\n The file I found this on has HIPPA information on it, so I can't upload it._","created_at":"2018-02-27T15:15:17Z","updated_at":"2019-02-12T14:56:37Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5d8835e471e2769e1f5c1ad1654df3bcb8a057e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/226/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/226/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/226/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/473e9871ee23528d2445fa2aaf00cd20e1746a60","head":{"label":"danschmidt1:master","ref":"master","sha":"473e9871ee23528d2445fa2aaf00cd20e1746a60","user":{"login":"danschmidt1","id":24616875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE2ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24616875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1","html_url":"https://github.com/danschmidt1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123140041,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMxNDAwNDE=","name":"tika","full_name":"danschmidt1/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"danschmidt1","id":24616875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE2ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24616875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1","html_url":"https://github.com/danschmidt1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danschmidt1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/danschmidt1/tika","description":"Mirror

4.0 includes a change to use form feed characters to separate\npages by default in its text output. Previous versions used no separator\nunless you specified the include_page_breaks option.\n\nThis confuses any parser that is not expecting the FF.\nODFParserTest.testOO2Metadata fails, because it is expecting the output of\na blank image to be the empty string, but now the FF is there.\n\nI haven't seen any other failures, but I expect that user code will now see\neither FF or U+FFFD where they are not expecting it (SafeContentHandler\nreplaces the FF with U+FFFD when converting to text to XML).\n\nFix this by setting Tesseract's page_separator option to the empty string.\nThis will preserve the no-page-breaks behavior with both Tesseract 3.x and\n4.0.\n\nAlso, add an option TesseractOCRConfig.pageSeparator so that user code can\nrequest the FF or any other separator, if they want it.","created_at":"2018-02-21T21:23:07Z","updated_at":"2018-03-31T07:48:45Z","closed_at":"2018-03-29T18:58:14Z","merged_at":"2018-03-29T18:58:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"65defb20301d40397e94076a4b2011688cb94637","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/65defb20301d40397e94076a4b2011688cb94637","head":{"label":"ewanmellor:TIKA-2582","ref":"TIKA-2582","sha":"65defb20301d40397e94076a4b2011688cb94637","user":{"login":"ewanmellor","id":894011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NDAxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/894011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor","html_url":"https://github.com/ewanmellor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewanmellor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"cef8494070cfbcb468c37da0f4732e2453d505ee","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206427,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0Mjc=","name":"tika","full_name":"apache/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tika","description":"The
