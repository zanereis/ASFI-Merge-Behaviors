Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR.

However, we do not support json-path append function for ORC format (see https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11722). Earlier, if the user tried to use JsonPath function append earlier, it would have not appended the item, but now the same function will return an exception. We are overriding the parse function used when append is invoked. So, row.getDimension(\"append\") results in java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Unused coming from\r\n\r\n[druid/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/java/util/common/parsers/FlattenerJsonProvider.java](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/0089f6b905f10a498506a747f0e05275fe366851/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/java/util/common/parsers/FlattenerJsonProvider.java#L118)\r\n\r\nThis is a potential issue to watch out for when upgrading.<br><hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nImplement batch kill in azure to speed up segment killing.\r\n\r\nI ran a quick test with 50k segments and kill sped up from 35 mins to ~2 minutes.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nI tried to keep this implementation analagous to the S3DataSegmentKiller. I used the azure batch api to do this. One thing I had to do was ignore the descriptor.json files but I think this is okay because those were discontinued in 2019 and the azure extension was made core in 2020. If someone happens to have segments with descriptor.json from that period the descriptor.json will be left in deep storage and have to get killed manually.\r\n\r\nI think this is worth it because otherwise I would have to fire off 2x as many batches to azure to delete all the descriptor.json files which generally don't exist. These failed requests also mess up the logs.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nSpeed up killing of segments in azure\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `AzureDataSegmentKiller`\r\n * `AzureStorage`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nAs part of becoming FIPS compliance, we are seeing this error: `salt must be at least 128 bits` when we run the Druid code against FIPS Compliant cryptographic security providers.\r\nThis PR fixes the salt size used in Pac4jSessionStore.java\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Even when the same input is used, it is possible to obtain different and unique hashes. These hashes aim to strengthen security, protect against dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, and several others. Very short salts are easier to attack and breach, thereby compromising your password.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

to this patch, we have two layers of mergeRunners for realtime queries: one for each Sink (a logical segment) and one across all Sinks. This is to keep metrics and results grouped by Sink, given that each FireHydrant within a Sink has its own separate storage adapter.\r\n\r\nHowever, it costs extra memory usage due to the extra layer of materialization. This is especially pronounced for groupBy queries, which only use their merge buffers at the top layer of merging. The lower layer of merging materializes ResultRows directly into the heap, which can cause heap exhaustion if there are enough ResultRows.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes to a single layer of merging when `bySegment: false`, just like Historicals. To accommodate that, segment metrics like `query/segment/time` are now per-FireHydrant instead of per-Sink.\r\n\r\nTwo layers of merging are retained when `bySegment: true`. This isn't common, because it's typically only used when segment level caching is enabled on the Broker, which is off by default.","created_at":"2024-01-25T07:21:45Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:32:18Z","closed_at":"2024-01-25T11:07:57Z","merged_at":"2024-01-25T11:07:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"01e9d963bd8615ccf035c2f301d87fc193837f7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

Users can ingest data stored in a Delta Lake table into Apache Druid via a new input source `delta`. This is available via the Delta Lake extension, add the `druid-deltalake-extensions` to the list of loaded extensions. The Delta input source reads the configured Delta Lake table and extracts all the underlying delta files in the table's latest snapshot. Delta Lake files are versioned Parquet format.\r\n\r\nThis is joint work with @abhishekagarwal87, @LakshSingla and @AmatyaAvadhanula.\r\n\r\nExample of a DML query using MSQ:\r\n```sql\r\nREPLACE INTO \"delta-employee-datasource\" OVERWRITE ALL\r\nSELECT * FROM TABLE(\r\n  EXTERN(\r\n    '{\"type\":\"delta\",\"tablePath\":\"s3a://your-bucket/employee-delta-table\"}',\r\n    '{\"type\":\"json\"}'\r\n  )\r\n) EXTEND (\"timestamp\" VARCHAR, \"name\" VARCHAR, \"age\" BIGINT, \"salary\" DOUBLE, \"bonus\" FLOAT)\r\nPARTITIONED BY ALL\r\n```\r\n\r\nDelta `ioConfig` in native batch spec :\r\n```json\r\n    \"ioConfig\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"index_parallel\",\r\n      \"inputSource\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"delta\",\r\n        \"tablePath\": \"s3a://your-bucket/employee-delta-table\"\r\n      },\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWeb-console screenshots:\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-01-30 at 02 45 51@2x](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/8687261/27a23382-f8d3-4c82-a783-12abda24d2a9)\r\n\r\nSample and ingestion of a mock dataset from the cloud:\r\n<img width=\"1727\" alt=\"CleanShot 2024-01-30 at 02 47 49@2x\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/8687261/1c1869fe-b861-4f7c-9f90-8280e7efe953\">\r\n\r\n\r\n[Delta 3.1.0](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/releases/tag/v3.1.0) just released.

Some of the servers have a DirectQueryRunner that creates `SingleThreadedScheduledExecutor`. In a case when native query was cancelled a thread would be created.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the server was removed from the list we lost a reference to the server view that holds the runner that holds executor. When at least one query was cancelled, but the reference was lost, then the thread would be waiting infinitely, with no possibility to GC it.\r\n\r\nThere was no cleanup of the executor.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n\r\n* Add `AutoClosable` to `QueryRunner` with default empty implementation - this way all functional interfaces implementation are still correct.\r\n* Add timeout of 5 minutes to one of the `future.get` methods that were blocking indefinitely (and they were in our clients case) in `DruidDirectClient`.\r\n* Implement `close` in `DruidDirectClient` that properly shuts down a thread pool.\r\n* Invoke `close` in removal of the `QueryableDruidServer` from the `BrokerServerView`.\r\n\r\n#### Reproducing\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this bug before the patch, we need to have a standard Druid cluster (for example `micro quickstart`) with one broker and one historical. We want to monitor Broker threads (for example with: `jconsol`). We need to have a command to spin up a second historical. Then the steps to reproduce are:\r\n\r\n1. Execute a long running native query and cancel it - this should trigger creation of the `query-cancellation-executor` thread. There should be only _one_ thread now.\r\n2. Start another historical.\r\n3. Execute a long running native query and cancel it - there should be _two_ of these threads\r\n4. Kill this 2nd historical - we still should have two threads on a list\r\n5. Start 2nd historical again\r\n6. Execute a long running native query and cancel it - there should be _three_ of these threads\r\n7. Thread leak detected, as we have 2 historical nodes, but 3 threads.\r\n8. Repeat kill, start, execute, cancel to get more threads.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nFixed: DirectDruidClient no longer leaks query-cancellation-executor threads after being removed by BrokerServerView.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `QueryRunner`\r\n * `DruidDirectClient`\r\n * `BrokerServerView`\r\n * `QueryableDruidServer`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\n- After upgrading the pac4j version here: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15522. We were not able to access the druid ui. \r\n- Upgraded the Nimbus libraries version to a compatible version to pac4j.\r\n-  In the older pac4j version, when we return RedirectAction there we also update the webcontext Response status code and add the authentication URL to the header. But in the newer pac4j version, we just simply return the RedirectAction. So that's why it was not getting redirected to the generated authentication URL.\r\n- To fix the above, I have updated the NOOP_HTTP_ACTION_ADAPTER to JEE_HTTP_ACTION_ADAPTER and it updates the HTTP Response in context as per the HTTP Action.\r\n \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR contains:\r\n* remove `integration-tests-ex/cases` from excluded projects from initial build\r\n* enable ErrorProne's `CheckedExceptionNotThrown` to get earlier errors than `intellij-inspections`\r\n* correct version for `ddsketch` module \r\n* fixed some spelling errors introduced by the merge of the `ddsketch` PR #15049\r\n\r\nI've bumped into some unrelated intellij errors fora PR and it turned out that its not specific to any PR:\r\n* recent runs of master shows that sometimes `intellij-inspections` for example this [build](https://github.com/apache/druid/actions/runs/7607133428/job/20713977290)\r\n* the contents of the commits are not related to these errors - they sometimes just happen; even in PR runs.\r\n* however the reported errors are always the same; and they always come from the `integration-tests-ex/cases/` module\r\n* the github workflow builds the whole project - except a few submodules ;and `integration-tests-ex/cases/` is one of them\r\n* because of that the intellij check is building that module \r\n\r\nbased on the above:\r\n* I think the preceeding build should not exclude that module\r\n* I've run a few times this job and the issue disappeared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>reported errors</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-01-22T06:30:04.0874181Z [ERROR]

https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15336 \r\n\r\n###  Revert PR Description: \r\nA low value of inSubQueryThreshold can cause queries with IN filter to plan as joins more commonly. However, some of these join queries may not get planned as IN filter on data nodes and causes significant perf regression.\r\nWe had reverted this default value of inSubQueryThreshold to 20, causing in filters with more elements to be planned as joins instead of OR filters, thus reverting it back to Integer.MAX_VALUE. We still need to find the best number for this value.\r\n\r\nThe default inSubQueryThreshold is Integer.MAX_VALUE. This was chosen at the time to maintain the then current behavior. However, this value is too high for most cases, and significant slowdown has been observed for large number of values, compared to joins.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

a utility function in Azure Storage.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently the batchDeleteFiles method in AzureStorage calls BlobBatchClient.deleteBlobs with DeleteSnapshotsOptionType.ONLY. This will only delete the snapshots and not the actual blob (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70880598/azure-blob-deletion-using-azure-storage-blob-and-nodejs)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the BatchBlobClient.deleteBlobs method needs the whole URI of the blobs it is deleting, rather than just the path. I had to patch the method to map blob paths to whole uris.\r\n\r\nI realized the URI error was getting swallowed up because the azure BatchBlobClient handles errors weirdly. If there are errors in the suboperations, it will throw a BlobStorageException or BlobBatchStorageException if any of the suboperations have failed, but only if you actually try to check the suboperation status. To get this method to actually throw a exception when there are errors, I added the forEach debug logging block. I thought this was a bit weird but this is actually how the azure docs reccomend making this call https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.batch.blobbatchclient?view=azure-java-stable.\r\n\r\nCurrently this utility method is used in one place, by the azure MSQE storage connector to cleanup intermediate files. Without this fix, those files will hang around until the task log cleaner cleans them up.\r\n\r\nI tested this in a test druid + azure setup by putting files into the durable storage directory in Azure and making sure they were cleaned up.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nFixed a bug with MSQE intermediate file cleanup.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Azure + MSQE durable storage cleanup bugfix.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `AzureStorage`\r\n * `AzureStorageConnector`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Changes\r\n- Simplify `DruidCluster.Builder`\r\n- Merge `BroadcastDistributionRuleSerdeTest` into `BroadcastDistributionRuleTest`\r\n- Refactor `UnloadUnusedSegmentsTest` and other tests to avoid mocking `DruidServer` and `LoadQueuePeon` objects.\r\n- Add abstract test class `CoordinatorBaseTest`.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a bigger PR which refactors `RunRulesTest` as well but as that was becoming too cumbersome, I have broken it up into smaller parts.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Description\r\nA low value of inSubQueryThreshold can cause queries with IN filter to plan as joins more commonly. However, some of these join queries may not get planned as IN filter on data nodes and causes significant perf regression.\r\nWe had reverted this default value of inSubQueryThreshold to 20, causing in filters with more elements to be planned as joins instead of OR filters, thus reverting it back to  Integer.MAX_VALUE. We still need to find the best number for this value.\r\n\r\nThe default inSubQueryThreshold is Integer.MAX_VALUE. This was chosen at the time to maintain the then current behavior. However, this value is too high for most cases, and significant slowdown has been observed for large number of values, compared to joins.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

It should be 1 thread per scheduled task. If the kafka emitter was emitting every eventType the lost event logging callable would never get called.\r\n\r\nThis change intelligently provisions the correct number of threads per scheduled task. 1 for each event type, and 1 for logging the lost events. This is a change to make this work. But in the future it would be worthwhile to make each task not be greedy and share threads so there isn't a need of a thread per task.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

tasks were removed from the documentation in #13107. Even at that time, they weren't really documented per se— just mentioned. They existed solely to support Tranquility, which is an obsolete ingestion method that predates migration of Druid to ASF and is no longer being maintained. Tranquility docs were de-linked from the sidebars and other docs earlier, in #11134. Only a stub remains today, so people with links to the page can see that it's no longer recommended.\r\n\r\n`index_realtime_appenderator` tasks existed in the code base, but were never documented, nor as far as I am aware were they used for any purpose.\r\n\r\nSince they are both obsolete, this patch removes both task types completely, as well as removes all supporting code that was otherwise unused. It also updates the stub doc for Tranquility to be firmer that it is not compatible. (Previously, the stub doc said it wasn't recommended, and pointed out that it is built against an ancient 0.9.2 version of Druid.)\r\n\r\nThis patch also has some related metrics changes:\r\n\r\n- rename FireDepartmentMetrics to SegmentGenerationMetrics\r\n- removes a useless call to `fireDepartmentMetrics.incrementProcessed()` in `SinglePhaseSubTask` (this metric was not being emitted anyway)","created_at":"2024-01-18T11:07:02Z","updated_at":"2024-06-26T16:44:23Z","closed_at":"2024-06-26T16:44:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d633c2c6d72a5270fe4366dd080f3928473c58bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

incorrect scale when reading decimal from parquet\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nGetting the Primitive from Group gives us back unscaledValue. We need to do unscaledValue * 10^(-scale) as explained in https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#decimal. The solution used here is similar to https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/pull/530 (which is using the movePointLeft method of BigDecimal to adjust based on the scale value)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a portion of the changes from the inactive draft PR for integrating the catalog with the Calcite planner https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13686 from @paul-rogers, allowing the datasource table schemas defined in the catalog to be validated against when ingesting data into the underlying datasource, during SQL based ingestion. This allows for SQL based ingestion into a table with a declared schema to produce segments that conform to that schema. If partitioning and clustering is not defined at ingestion time, defaults for these parameters, as defined in the catalog for the table, if found, are used.\r\n\r\nTODO: add more tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Problem Description\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12599, operators can configure `druid.coordinator.kill.bufferPeriod`,\r\n allowing the `KillUnusedSegments` duty to utilize the buffer period to find candidate unused segments.\r\n\r\n- The coordinator duty `KillUnusedSegments` determines an umbrella interval\r\n   for each datasource to determine the kill interval. The umbrella interval can be a widened\r\n   interval and there can be multiple unused segments in this interval with different\r\n  `used_status_last_updated` timestamps. For example, consider two unused segments in the\r\n   interval `[2023-01-01/2023-01-05]` that  were marked as unused at different times, one that \r\n   is 30 days old and another that is 1 hour old.\r\n   \r\n - However, when a kill task is instantiated with this umbrella interval, it’d kill all the unused segments\r\n    found in the interval regardless of the last updated timestamp. In the above example, the kill task\r\n    after the 30-day mark would kill both the unused segments and not retain the 1-hour old one.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nPass in the `maxUsedFlagLastUpdatedTime` to the kill task and the unused segments retrieve task action.\r\nAdjust the metadata SQL query to account for `used_status_last_updated` <= `maxUsedStatusLastUpdatedTime` when `maxUsedFlagLastUpdatedTime` is non-null.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

This occurred when multiple unused segments within an interval were marked as unused at different times.\r\n- Users can submit kill tasks with an optional parameter `maxUsedStatusLastUpdatedTime`. When set to a date time, the kill task considers segments in the specified `interval` marked as unused no later than this time. The default behavior is to kill all unused segments in the interval regardless of the time when segments where marked as unused.\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #15704 \r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n Add pre-check for heavy debug log\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to #14695  to move configs from using skife to regular `JsonConfigurator`.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n- More structured configs that adhere to rest of the Druid code.\r\n- Classes that need only a small subset of configs need not be passed the entire `DruidCoordinatorConfig` object\r\n- Easier validation of configs done on service startup rather than when running duties.\r\n\r\n### Change summary\r\n- Add new config classes `CoordinatorRunConfig`, `CoordinatorKillConfigs`, `CoordinatorPeriodConfig`\r\n- Bind new config classes to property paths instead of `DruidCoordinatorConfig`\r\n- Make `DruidCoordinatorConfig` act as a container for the above configs\r\n- Add `MetadataCleanupConfig` to serve as a common config container for all metadata cleanups\r\n- Move validations from `MetadataCleanupDuty` to `DruidCoordinatorConfig` for cleaner code and to allow coordinator to fail fast on startup in case of invalid config values.\r\n- Disable zk-based segment loading option\r\n- All configs (except zk-based loading) retain their current paths and default values\r\n\r\n### Added configs\r\n\r\n#### 1. `CoordinatorRunConfig`\r\nPath: `druid.coordinator`\r\nFields: `period`, `startDelay`\r\nDescription: Configs related to the running of the coordinator\r\n\r\n#### 2. `CoordinatorPeriodConfig`\r\nPath: `druid.coordinator.period`\r\nFields: `indexingPeriod`, `metadataStoreManagementPeriod`\r\nDescription: Additional periods related to the operation of the coordinator\r\n\r\n#### 3. `CoordinatorKillConfigs`\r\nPath: `druid.coordinator.kill`\r\nFields 1: `audit`, `compaction`, `datasource`, `rules`, `supervisors`, `pendingSegments`\r\nDescription: Each of the above fields is deserialized as a `MetadataCleanupConfig` which in-turn contains the following fields:\r\n- `on`: Whether cleanup is enabled\r\n- `period`: Cleanup period\r\n- `durationToRetain`: Duration of metadata to retain\r\n\r\nFields 2: `on`, `period`, `durationToRetain`, `bufferPeriod`, `ignoreDurationToRetain`, `maxSegments`\r\nDescription: These fields are related to cleanup of unused segments.\r\n\r\n### ZK-based segment loading disabled\r\n- ZK-based segment loading has been deprecated for several Druid releases\r\n- This PR is getting rid of the config `druid.coordinator.loadqueuepeon.type`, thus always using `HttpLoadQueuePeon`\r\n- The code for ZK-based segment loading is not being removed yet as it might be needed for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\nZookeeper-based segment loading is being removed as it is known to have issues and has been deprecated for several releases. The recent improvements made to the Druid coordinator are also known to work much better with HTTP-based segment loading.\r\n\r\nThe following configs are being removed as they are not needed anymore:\r\n- `druid.coordinator.load.timeout`: Not needed as the default value of this parameter (15 minutes) is known to work well for all clusters\r\n- `druid.coordinator.loadqueuepeon.type`: Not needed as this value will always be `http`\r\n- `druid.coordinator.curator.loadqueuepeon.numCallbackThreads`: Not needed as zookeeper(curator)-based segment loading is not an option anymore\r\n\r\nAuto-cleanup of compaction configs of inactive datasources is now enabled by default.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-17T11:38:20Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T08:21:14Z","closed_at":"2024-04-29T18:37:13Z","merged_at":"2024-04-29T18:37:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa4631497158d657bafb3d1831f7ac4cc2c6ca9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

PR aims to let the original RetrieveUsedSegmentsAction work with REPLACE locks by introducing a boolean flag.\r\nWhen the task does not hold any REPLACE locks, the behaviour is identical to the existing behaviour.\r\nHowever, when there are REPLACE locks, only segments that were created before the times corresponding to the versions of the locks will be fetched for their respective intervals.\r\n\r\nUsing the original action helps with rolling upgrades where the flag is simply ignored when the overlord has not been upgraded.\r\nIt also helps eliminate the need for the undocumented parameter introduced in #15430 \r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

#14866, there is no longer a reason for IncrementalIndex#add to be thread-safe.\r\n\r\nIt turns out it already was not using its selectors in a thread-safe way, as exposed by #15615 making `testMultithreadAddFactsUsingExpressionAndJavaScript` in `IncrementalIndexIngestionTest` flaky. Note that this problem isn't new: Strings have been stored in the dimension selectors for some time, but we didn't have a test that checked for that case; we only have this test that checks for concurrent adds involving numeric selectors.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, this patch changes OnheapIncrementalIndex to no longer try to offer a thread-safe \"add\" method. It also improves performance a bit by adding a row ID supplier to the selectors it uses to read InputRows, meaning that it can get the benefit of caching values inside the selectors.\r\n\r\nThis patch also:\r\n\r\n1) Adds synchronization to HyperUniquesAggregator and CardinalityAggregator,\r\n   which the similar datasketches versions already have. This is done to\r\n   help them adhere to the contract of Aggregator: concurrent calls to\r\n   \"aggregate\" and \"get\" must be thread-safe.\r\n\r\n2) Updates OnHeapIncrementalIndexBenchmark to use JMH and moves it to the\r\n   druid-benchmarks module.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks below. I think the speedup is mainly due to the additional caching enabled by the row ID supplier. The benchmark involves two primitive aggregators reading the same input fields, which would now be able to make use of in-selector caching.\r\n\r\n```\r\npatch\r\n\r\nBenchmark

Description\r\nImplement pushTaskPayload/streamTaskPayload for azure blob storage so mmless ingestion can run with larger ingestion payloads when using azure as the deep storage location.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you try running mmless ingestion with azure blob storage as the deep storage provider and use a task payload that is too large, the task logs will throw a NotImplementedException because the relevant functions are not implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nSupport ingestion payloads larger than ~1MB for mmless ingestion on azure.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `AzureTaskLogs`\r\n * `AzureTaskLogsTest`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been

discussed after #15552 was merged (relevant conversation starts from [this comment](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15552#issuecomment-1879849582) ) there might be a chance that the patch have caused the `ConstantExpr` classes to be unsafe due to the fact that `ExprEval` is unsafe as it contains a string-caching logic.\r\n\r\nTo become thread-safe for sure - but still retain the benefits of not producing `ExprEval` objects every time a constant is evaluated; this patch adds:\r\n* `Expr#singleThreaded` which creates a singleThreaded version of the actual expression (caching ExprEval is allowed)\r\n* `Expr#makeSingleThreaded` to make a whole subtree of expressions *singleThreaded*\r\n   * uses `Shuttle` to create the new expression tree\r\n* `ConstantExpr#singleThreaded` creates a specialized `ConstantExpr` which does cache the `ExprEval`\r\n* some `@Immutable` annotations were added to make it more likely to notice that there might be something off if a similar change will be made around here for some

readers were running UTF-8 decode on the provided entity to convert it to a String, then parsing the String as JSON. The patch changes them to parse the provided entity's input stream directly.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the nice error messages that include parse errors, the readers now need to open the entity again on the error path, to re-read the data. To make this possible, the InputEntity#open contract is tightened to require the ability to re-open entities, and existing InputEntity implementations are updated to allow re-opening.\r\n\r\nThis patch also renames JsonLineReaderBenchmark to JsonInputFormatBenchmark, updates it to benchmark all three JSON readers, and adds a case that reads fields out of the parsed row (not just creates it).\r\n\r\nBenchmarks below. Findings:\r\n\r\n- The `reader` and `node_reader` (used if `useJsonNodeReader` is set) readers are ~22% faster on `parseAndRead`. `reader` is the default for stream ingest; `node_reader` is used for stream ingest if `useJsonNodeReader` is set.\r\n- The high variance in the `patch` branch with `node_reader` + `discovery = true` happened because my computer fell asleep while running that one. I didn't re-run it, because I felt the other results were compelling enough.\r\n- The `line_reader` wasn't changed in this patch and performance is similar (likely within margin of error). This one is default for batch ingest, and used for streaming if `assumeNewlineDelimited` is set.\r\n\r\nSo, the speedups are mainly for streaming ingest. But #15681 has a similar speedup for `line_reader` if that's the one you care about!\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster\r\n\r\nBenchmark                              (discovery)  (readerTypeString)  Mode  Cnt

a bug where the KafkaInputFormat would parse incoming JSON newline-delimited (as if it were a batch ingest) rather than as a whole entity (as is typical for streaming ingest).\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nJsonInputFormat has a `withLineSplittable` method that can be used to control whether JSON is read line-by-line, or as a whole. The intent is that in streaming ingestion, `lineSplittable` is false (although it can be overridden by `assumeNewlineDelimited`), and in batch ingestion, `lineSplittable` is true.\r\n\r\nWhen a `json` format is wrapped by a `kafka` format, this isn't set properly. This patch updates KafkaInputFormat to set this on an underlying `json` format.\r\n\r\nThe tests for KafkaInputFormat were overriding the `lineSplittable` parameter explicitly, which wasn't really fair, because that made them unrealistic to what happens in production. Now they omit the parameter and get the production behavior.","created_at":"2024-01-16T07:08:11Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T08:50:10Z","closed_at":"2024-01-18T11:22:41Z","merged_at":"2024-01-18T11:22:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"764f41d9593b280cf00a06869dc0f6efedcb7566","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563043,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Streaming%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Problem\r\n\r\nDruid currently does not allow export of tables in a programmatic manner. While is is possible to download results from a SELECT query, this relies on writing the results to a single query report, which cannot support large datasets. An export syntax which writes the results in a desired format directly to an external location (such as s3 or hdfs) would be useful. \r\n\r\n```\r\n(INSERT/REPLACE) INTO\r\nEXTERN(<external source function>)\r\nAS <format>\r\n[OVERWRITE ALL]\r\n<select query>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example: A statement to export all rows from a table into S3 as CSV files would look like \r\n```\r\nREPLACE INTO \r\nEXTERN(s3(bucket='bucket1', prefix='export/', tempDir='/var/temp'))\r\nAS CSV\r\nOVERWRITE ALL\r\nSELECT * FROM wikipedia\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitially, only CSV is supported as an export format, but this can be expanded to support other formats easily.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n- Adds export statements to MSQ, as a part of INSERT and REPLACE statements.

Description\r\nNested columns maintain a null value bitmap for which rows are nulls, however I forgot to wire up a `ColumnIndexSupplier` to nested columns when filtering the 'raw' data itself, so these were not able to be used. This PR fixes that by adding a supplier that can return `NullValueIndex` to be used by the `NullFilter`, which should speed up `is null` and `is not null` filters on json columns.\r\n\r\nI haven't spent the time to measure the difference yet, but I imagine it should be a significant speed increase.\r\n\r\nNote that I only wired this up if `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false` (sql compatible mode), the reason being that the SQL planner still uses selector filter, which is unable to properly handle any arrays or complex types (including json, even checking for nulls). The reason for this is so that the behavior is consistent between using the index and using the value matcher, otherwise we get into a situation where using the index has correct behavior but using the value matcher does not, which I was trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nWe could consider modifying the SQL planner to always use the new equality and null filters if the type is array or complex, but that is a bit larger change.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

When a task lock posse is created, add the task to it immediately. This would help avoid leaving behind phantom posses without associated tasks. This helps simplify changes made as part of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14966.\r\n  A task posse could be created but the task may not be associated with it due to failures during segment allocation etc. This can leave behind an empty posse associated with a phantom lock that can block ingestion. The workaround was to restart the overlord. The change made in this PR associates the task with its requested posse immediately and will help the task lockbox to clean it up when `unlock` is called.\r\n\r\n2) When an appending task lock is acquired by a task, check if any of the conflicting locks is superseded by it. If yes, unlock the unneeded old locks associated with the task. \r\n   Consider an appending lock acquired for an hour granularity by a streaming task with concurrent append and replace. If a concurrent replacing task increments the version of the segments and changes the granularity from hour to day, the next allocation from the task for the same timestamp would create a day lock which supersedes the existing hour lock. If both the locks are associated with the task, this can lead to the transactional append action to fail because of an invalid state of the locks. The change in this PR would prevent such a state from occurring.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.61.0</h2>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove unused experimental API ManagedChannelBuilder.enableFullStreamDecompression (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10744\">#10744</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Deprecate LoadBalancer.EMPTY_PICKER added in 1.58.0 in favor of FixedResultPicker (860b5cb1f)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>binder: Experimental support for asynchronous security policies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10566\">#10566</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: reduce CompositeReadableBuffer allocation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/3279\">#3279</a>)</li>\n<li>core: Improve error message clarity when a channel leak is detected (201893f5e)</li>\n<li>util: use shared index across <code>round_robin</code> pickers (dca89b25b). This makes its implementation more similar to <code>weighted_round_robin</code>.</li>\n<li>xds: Implement ADS stream flow control mechanism (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10674\">#10674</a>). This limits the maximum memory consumed if the control plane sends updates more rapidly than they can be processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Check outbound maximum message size for the compressed size in addition to the already-checked uncompressed size (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10739\">#10739</a>). Fixed the status code to be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead of UNKNOWN.</li>\n<li>util: Fix NPE when multiple addresses are in an address group for petiole load balancer policies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10769\">#10769</a>)</li>\n<li>util: Disable publishing of fixtures (8ac43dd81). The Gradle test fixtures are for use by grpc-java's internal tests.</li>\n<li>okhttp: Ignore known conscrypt socket close issue (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10812\">#10812</a>). This stops an exception from being thrown when a known Conscrypt synchronization issue happens.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop support for Bazel 5 (55a9c012c). Bazel 7 is available, and Protobuf has already dropped support for Bazel 5.</li>\n<li>Change many compile deps to runtime deps (d6830d7f9). This reduces the transitive classes &quot;leaked&quot; into the compile classpath. In particular, grpc-core (<code>io.grpc.internal</code>) will be less frequently included transitively at compile time.</li>\n<li>Upgrade dependencies (c985797d9)\n<ul>\n<li>Protobuf to 3.25.1</li>\n<li>auto-value-annotations to 1.10.4</li>\n<li>error_prone_annotations to 2.23.0</li>\n<li>proto-google-common-protos to 2.29.0</li>\n<li>google-cloud-logging to 3.15.14</li>\n<li>guava to 32.1.3-android</li>\n<li>okio to 3.4.0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Gordiychuk\"><code>@​Gordiychuk</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jroper\"><code>@​jroper</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jyane\"><code>@​jyane</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ulfjack\"><code>@​ulfjack</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.60.1</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>util: Fix NPE when multiple addresses in an address group for petiole load balancer policies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10770\">#10770</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.60.0</h2>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Stabilize <code>ForwardingServerBuilder</code>, <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code>, and <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code>. Note that <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code> is stabilized (no changes will be made to it), but immediately deprecated in favor of <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10586\">#10586</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Deprecate <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder.delegate()</code>. De facto this deprecates the class itself, since all classes extending <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code> implement the <code>delegate()</code> method. See javadoc for details (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10587\">#10587</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Changed recently-introduced <code>LoadBalancer.acceptResolvedAddresses()</code> to return <code>Status</code> instead of <code>boolean</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10636\">#10636</a>).

patch adds a new ImmutableLookupMap, which comes with an ImmutableLookupExtractor. It uses a fastutil open hashmap plus two lists to store its data in such a way that forward and reverse lookups can both be done quickly. I also observed footprint to be somewhat smaller than Java HashMap + MapLookupExtractor for a 1 million row lookup.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage, though, is that reverse lookups can be done much more quickly than MapLookupExtractor (which iterates the entire map for each call to unapplyAll). This speeds up the recently added ReverseLookupRule (#15626) during SQL planning with very large lookups.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMore details on benchmarks and size analysis below.\r\n\r\nIn the benchmark report, `keysPerValue` is the number of keys that map to each value. `lookupType` is either `hashmap` (MapLookupExtractor backed by Java HashMap, as we use today) or `immutable` (the new one). The test cases are `lookupApply` (forward lookup), `lookupUnapplyOne` (reverse lookup of a single value), and `lookupUnapplyOneThousand` (reverse lookup of one thousand values).\r\n\r\nI also took heap dumps from the benchmark datasets, to measure how much space the two implementations take.\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\n\r\n- `apply` is about the same speed in both implementations.\r\n- All the reverse lookup calls are substantially faster with `immutable`. Performance is closest for the `keysPerValue: 1000`, `lookupUnapplyOneThousand` case. In this case, the reverse lookup is returning the entire key space, because it's 1,000 values * 1,000 keys per value = 1,000,000 keys.\r\n- MapLookupExtractor backed by HashMap had a table with 2097152 entries. It measured 168,388,688 bytes total retained.\r\n- ImmutableLookupMap had a `keysToEntry` table with 2097153 entries, and `keys` and `values` lists with 1000000 entries. It measured 154,501,488 bytes total retained. It's smaller because it ends up being three string arrays and one int array, which compares favorably to the array of hashtable bucket objects that HashMap uses.\r\n\r\nGiven these findings, I think it's a good idea to use the immutable version wherever we can. So, the patch also updates the main static lookups (URI and JDBC) to use it always.\r\n\r\nIn a future patch, for getting faster reverse Kafka lookups, it's probably a good idea to implement a mutable lookup that supports faster reverse lookups, and run that only on the Broker. (Assuming it will end up being larger footprint than the `ConcurrentHashMap` we use today, we wouldn't want to run it on every data server. Only the Broker needs fast reverse lookups.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                          (keysPerValue)  (lookupType)  (numKeys)   Mode  Cnt          Score         Error

now allows empty ingest queries by default. For such queries that don't generate any output rows, the query counters in the async status result object/task report don't contain `numTotalRows` and `totalSizeInBytes`. These properties when not set/undefined can be confusing to API clients. For example, the web-console treats it as unknown values.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the counters by explicitly reporting them as 0 instead of null for empty ingest queries.\r\n\r\n- Add a test case each for an empty insert and empty replace query in `SqlMSQStatementResourcePostTest.java`. Validate the responses which now include `ResultSetInformation` with 0 rows instead of null.\r\n- Add test coverage for all the MSQ Destinations, including `DataSourceMSQDestination` and `TaskReportMSQDestination` in `SqlStatementResourceHelperTest.java`. We don't report 0 values for `DurableStorageDestination` type as it only applies to select queries as it can be unknown, so the behavior is preserved as-is.\r\n- Some miscellaneous spacing, typo and interpolation log fixes in `QueryHostFinder.java` that I found while testing this patch.\r\n\r\nBefore the fix, web-console interpreting as unknown number of rows:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"462\" alt=\"CleanShot 2024-01-11 at 23 39 53@2x\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/8687261/766b1226-bc40-44d5-a583-22e1baa4b9cf\">\r\n\r\nAfter the fix:\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n* Enables MSQ tests on queries using EARLIEST/LATEST/EARLIEST_BY/LATEST_BY aggregators\r\n* Removes the limitations in the docs, since numeric first/last can now be used with MSQ and at ingestion time\r\n* (THIS IS REMOVED FROM THIS PATCH) Disallows EARLIEST_BY and LATEST_BY to be used with rolled-up pairLongObjects. This is done to prevent the caller from supplying the timeExpr, which will get ignored by the native engine, and might be unexpected behavior. The correct way to further aggregate such columns would be using EARLIEST/LATEST, where the caller understands that the time column would be implicitly taken from the rolled-up metric. In the following example:\r\n* \r\n```sql\r\n-- Insert data into a table using the following query. 'finalize' should be false in the query context to enable rollup\r\nINSERT INTO dim1 foo EARLIEST_BY(m1, timestampCol1) FROM EXTERN(...) GROUP BY dim1\r\n\r\n-- Rollup the pre-aggregated metric, with a different timestamp column\r\n-- In such a case, the native aggregator will ignore the value from the timestampCol2 and use the value that was aggregated during the ingestion. To prevent such errors, the call is disallowed, and user friendly message is thrown\r\nSELECT EARLIEST_BY(m1, timestampCol2) FROM foo\r\n  \r\n-- Rollup, with the column that was used during the ingestion time\r\nSELECT EARLIEST(m1) FROM foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst/Last aggregators call `.toString()` on complex metrics (that aren't type of pairLongLong, pairLongString...) and array types, which is also weird, however, that hasn't been changed, because that has been supported for a long time, and is also documented implicitly. \r\n\r\nDisallowing `EARLIEST_BY(aggregatedMetric, timestampCol2)` will call the users to change their queries, however the equivalent call to this is `EARLIEST(aggregatedMetric)`, which is a lot more clear, as the explicitly typed column by the user isn't ignored. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nEARLIEST_BY and LATEST_BY cannot be used with complex objects created during ingestion (with rollup) with the first/last aggregators. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

patch changes the `WindowFrame` internals / representation a bit; introduces a dedicated frametype for `rows`, `groups`, `unbounded` - so that later if we decide to add better ranges support it will less likely need a bigger refactor\r\n\r\nit also changes how its represented in the native query:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-      frame: { peerType: \"ROWS\", lowUnbounded: true, lowOffset: 0, uppUnbounded:

Description\r\nThis PR cleans up some stuff after the removal of group by v1 in #14866 so that stuff is a bit easier to follow. The biggest material change is that all common code of `GroupByQueryEngineV2` that is used by both non-vectorized and vectorized engines has been moved into `GroupingEngine`, including the `process` method which chooses which of non-vectorized and vectorized processing to use, and has been inlined into the `process` method of `GroupingEngine`.  \r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n* `GroupByQueryEngineV2` has been renamed to `GroupByQueryEngine`, and now is totally focused on non-vectorized processing (since shared stuff has been moved into `GroupingEngine`\r\n* `GroupByMergingQueryRunnerV2` has been renamed to `GroupByMergingQueryRunner`\r\n* `GroupByBinaryFnV2` has been renamed to `GroupByResultMergeFn`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #15663 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

speedups for FrameChannelMerger (which does k-way merging in MSQ):\r\n\r\n1) Replace the priority queue with a tournament tree, which does fewer comparisons.\r\n\r\n2) Compare keys using 8-byte strides, rather than 1 byte at a time.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks below. In these benchmarks:\r\n\r\n- keys can be `random` (20 random characters) or `sequential` (incrementing numbers stored as zero-padded strings, like `'00000000000000000001'`, `'00000000000000000002'`, etc).\r\n- rows can be distributed `round_robin` across channels (first key to first channel, second key to second channel, etc) or `clustered` (first N keys to first channel, next N keys to second channel, etc).\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\n\r\n- The tournament tree and priority queue are about the same speed when there are two channels, but for 16 channels, the tournament tree is ~30% faster. Presumably this is due to doing fewer comparisons.\r\n- 8-byte strides give a ~5% speedup when there are two channels. For 16 channels, they give a bigger ~15% speedup over tournament trees alone. Presumably this is due to 16 channels requiring more comparisons, so there's more opportunities for the longer stride to make a difference.\r\n- Overall, combining tournament trees and 8-byte strides gives a ~5% speedup for two channels, and ~40% speedup for 16 channels. \r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster (priority queue, 1 byte stride)\r\n\r\nBenchmark

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n \r\nCurrently prometheus-emitter extension exposes prometheus metric types histogram, gauge and counter as `timer`, `gauge` and `count` respectively. Users can chose the metric type for each Druid metric by supplying a dimension map in the form of a json file. Otherwise a [default mapping](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-contrib/prometheus-emitter/src/main/resources/defaultMetrics.json) is chosen. Example of this json file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"query/time\" : { \"dimensions\" : [\"dataSource\", \"type\"], \"type\" : \"timer\", \"conversionFactor\": 1000.0, \"help\":  \"Seconds taken to complete a query.\"},\r\n\"query/bytes\" : { \"dimensions\" : [\"dataSource\", \"type\"], \"type\" : \"count\", \"help\":  \"Number of bytes returned in query response.\"},\r\n\"segment/scan/pending\" : { \"dimensions\" : [], \"type\" : \"gauge\", \"help\": \"Number of segments in queue waiting to be scanned.\"},\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now the emitter creates histograms with pre-defined buckets and allows a scaling factor if the bucket sizes are unsuitable. This has the following problems:\r\n* the pre-defined buckets might not be suitable for all use-cases\r\n* bucket sizing has to differ depending on the metric, for example query latency buckets might be different from TTFB\r\n* every observation is divided by the scaling factor, but if its not provided the observation ends up in the largest bucket because we are effectively dividing by zero.\r\n\r\n#### Other problems this PR tries to fix:\r\n* prometheus histogram metric is exposed as a `Timer` with pre-defined buckets. This assumes that histogram is only suitable for duration observations and not size observations.\r\n* Additional prometheus metric types like `Summary` are not supported currently.\r\n* [explicit casting to prometheus metric](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-contrib/prometheus-emitter/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/emitter/prometheus/PrometheusEmitter.java#L172) making it messy to support `Timer` and `Histogram` metric types simultaneously.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn this patch we try to solve these issues by:\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n#### Supporting new metric types\r\nThis patch adds explicit support for `histogram` and `summary`. So users will be able to define these metrics in the `dimensionMap.json` like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"sqlQuery/time\": {\"dimensions\":  [\"dataSource\"], \"type\":  \"histogram\", \"buckets\":  [100, 250, 500, 1000, 5000], \"help\": \"Milliseconds taken to complete SQL query\"},\r\n  \"sqlQuery/planningTimeMs\": {\"dimensions\":  [\"dataSource\"], \"type\": \"summary\", \"quantiles\":  [0.5, 0.95, 0.99], \"errors\":  [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001], \"ageSeconds\": 100, \"ageBuckets\": 5, \"help\": \"Milliseconds to plan a SQL query to native query.\"},\r\n```\r\n#### Enabling generics\r\nTo prevent any casting errors and to make our intention of simultaneously supporting `timer` and `histogram` explicit; java generics are used, with the `Timer` class extending the `Histogram` class.\r\n\r\nFollowing classes are removed:\r\n* [`DimensionsAndCollector`](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-contrib/prometheus-emitter/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/emitter/prometheus/DimensionsAndCollector.java) class is removed and in its place  [`Metrics`](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/8c5640b0e977bc96e615609386ed9104b2f523fa/extensions-contrib/prometheus-emitter/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/emitter/prometheus/metrics/Metric.java) abstract class is added that contains all common logic across metric types.\r\n\r\nFollowing classes are added for each prometheus metric types that extend the abstract class:\r\n* `Gauge` for  prometheus gauge, should appear as `gauge` in the dimension map\r\n* `Counter` for prometheus counter, should appear as `count` in the dimension map\r\n* `Summary` for prometheus summary, should appear as `summary` in the dimension map\r\n* `Histogram` for prometheus histogram, should appear as `histogram` in the dimension map\r\n* `Timer` that extends the `Histogram` with predefined buckets, should appear as `timer` in the dimension map\r\n* `MetricType` enum is added and used by jackson to differentiate between metric types.\r\n\r\nThe naming convention of `count` for `Counter` and support for `Timer` is for backward compatibility. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable?
