What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nsupport to set the meta conf in HiveMetastoreClient. you can pass meta info to an external multi-tenant metasotre by utilizing the meta conf, such as user name, auth info etc. \r\n\r\nfor example,  you should add the following config in SparkConf, to use the meta conf `user.name` .\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql.hive.metastore.metaconf.prefix     hive.metastore.metaconf.\r\nspark.hive.metastore.metaconf.user.name      xxx\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\ncurrently, we can't set the meta conf in `HiveMetastoreClient`,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix `Series.astype` when converting datetime type to StringDtype, to match the behavior of pandas 1.3.\r\n\r\nIn pandas < 1.3,\r\n```python\r\n>>> pd.Series([\"2020-10-27 00:00:01\", None], name=\"datetime\").astype(\"string\")\r\n0    2020-10-27 00:00:01\r\n1                    NaT\r\nName: datetime, dtype:

<NA>\r\nName: datetime, dtype: string\r\n```\r\n\r\nin pandas >= 1.3, so we follow the behavior of latest pandas.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause pandas-on-Spark always follow the behavior of latest pandas.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the behavior is changed to latest pandas when converting datetime to nullable string

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a task thread is interrupted, the underlying output stream referred by `DiskBlockObjectWriter.mcs` may have been closed, then we get IOException when flushing the buffered data. This breaks the assumption that `revertPartialWritesAndClose()` should not throw exceptions.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, we can catch the IOException in `ManualCloseOutputStream.manualClose()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously the IOException was not captured, thus `revertPartialWritesAndClose()` threw an exception. When this happens, `BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter.stop()` would stop deleting the temp_shuffle files tracked by `partitionWriters`, hens lead to temp_shuffle file leak issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is an internal bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by running a longevity stress test. After the fix, there is no more leaked temp_shuffle files.","created_at":"2021-08-12T20:45:31Z","updated_at":"2021-08-13T17:49:15Z","closed_at":"2021-08-13T10:25:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4ba86b4be03d314f79a2c3e8fb42fe87e944a6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33731/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33731/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33731/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49216a2262ddff76252fed56d094478b64305633","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:temp_shuffle","ref":"temp_shuffle","sha":"49216a2262ddff76252fed56d094478b64305633","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, `null + interval` will become `cast(cast(null as timestamp) + interval) as null`. This is a unexpected behavior and the result should not be of null type.\r\nThis weird behavior applies to `null - interval`, `interval + null`, `interval - null` as well.\r\nTo change it, I propose to cast the null as the same data type of the other element in the add/subtract:\r\n```\r\nnull + interval => cast(null as interval) + interval\r\nnull - interval => cast(null as interval) - interval\r\ninterval + null=> interval + cast(null as interval)\r\ninterval - null => interval - cast(null as interval)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nChange the confusing behavior of `Interval +/- NULL` and `NULL +/- Interval`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the new interval type is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently we have the following logic to deal with the JDBC keytab provided by the `--files` option\r\n\r\n`if (keytabParam != null && FilenameUtils.getPath(keytabParam).isEmpty)`\r\n`{`     \r\n`    ` `val result = SparkFiles.get(keytabParam)`     \r\n`    ` `logDebug(s\"Keytab path not found, assuming --files, file name used on executor: $result\")`     \r\n`    ` `result` \r\n`}` ` else {`\r\n`    ` `logDebug(\"Keytab path found, assuming manual upload\")`\r\n`    ` `keytabParam`\r\n`}`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpark has already created the soft link in the current working directory of driver (application master) for the file submitted by the `--files` option in cluster mode. Here is an example.\r\n`testusera1.keytab -> /var/opt/hadoop/temp/nm-local-dir/usercache/testusera1/appcache/application_1628584679772_0003/filecache/12/testusera1.keytab`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, SparkFiles.get will get a wrong path of keytab for the driver in cluster mode. In cluster mode, the keytab is available at the following location for both the driver and executors\r\n`/var/opt/hadoop/temp/nm-local-dir/usercache/testusera1/appcache/application_1628584679772_0003/container_1628584679772_0030_01_000001/testusera1.keytab`\r\nwhile `SparkFiles.get` brings the following wrong location\r\n`/var/opt/hadoop/temp/nm-local-dir/usercache/testusera1/appcache/application_1628584679772_0003/spark-8fb0f437-c842-4a9f-9612-39de40082e40/userFiles-5075388b-0928-4bc3-a498-7f6c84b27808/testusera1.keytab`\r\n\r\nSo there is no need to call the function `SparkFiles.get` to get the absolute path of the keytab file if it exists at the current working directory of Yarn container. We can directly use the variable `keytabParam` as the keytab file path.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe need to check whether the keytab exists in the current directory. If it is in the current directory, we do not need to call SparkFiles.get to obtain the file. To check whether the keytab exists in the current directory, we use the function call `!Files.exists(Paths.get(keytabParam))`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. Promote more string literal in subtractions. In the ANSI type coercion rule, we already promoted \r\n```\r\nstring - timestamp => cast(string as timestamp) - timestamp\r\n```\r\nThis PR is to promote the following string literals:\r\n```\r\nstring - date => cast(string as date) - date\r\ndate - string => date - cast(date as string)\r\ntimestamp - string => timestamp\r\n```\r\nIt is very straightforward to cast the string literal as the data type of the other side in the subtraction.\r\n\r\n2. Merge the string promotion logic from the rule `StringLiteralCoercion`:\r\n```\r\ndate_sub(date, string) => date_sub(date, cast(string as int))\r\ndate_add(date, string) => date_add(date, cast(string as int))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Promote the string literal in the subtraction as the data type of the other side. This is straightforward and consistent with PostgreSQL\r\n2. Certerize all the string literal promotion in the ANSI type coercion rule\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the new ANSI type coercion rules are not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current `MapOutputTracker` class may throw `NegativeArraySizeException` with a large number of partitions. Within the serializeOutputStatuses() method, it is trying to compress an array of mapStatuses and outputting the binary data into (Apache)ByteArrayOutputStream . Inside the (Apache)ByteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray(), negative index exception happens because the index is int and overflows (2GB limit) when the output binary size is too large.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes two high-level ideas:\r\n  1. Use `org.apache.spark.util.io.ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream`, which has a way to output the underlying buffer as `Array[Array[Byte]]`.\r\n  2. Change the signatures from `Array[Byte]` to `Array[Array[Byte]]` in order to handle over 2GB compressed data.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis issue seems to be missed out in the earlier effort of addressing 2GB limitations [SPARK-6235](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-6235)\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, `spark.default.parallelism` needs to be kept at the low number. The drawback of setting smaller spark.default.parallelism is that it requires more executor memory (more data per partition). Setting `spark.io.compression.zstd.level` to higher number (default 1) hardly helps.\r\n\r\nThat essentially means we have the data size limit that for shuffling and does not scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPassed existing tests\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"core/testOnly org.apache.spark.MapOutputTrackerSuite\"\r\n```\r\nAlso added a new unit test\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"core/testOnly org.apache.spark.MapOutputTrackerSuite  -- -z SPARK-32210\"\r\n```\r\nRan the benchmark using GitHub Actions and didn't not observe any performance penalties. The results are attached in this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement `DataFrame.combine_first`.\r\n\r\nThe PR is based on https://github.com/databricks/koalas/pull/1950. Thanks @AishwaryaKalloli for the prototype.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUpdate null elements with value in the same location in another is a common use case.\r\nThat is supported in pandas. We should support that as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. `DataFrame.combine_first` can be used.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> ps.set_option(\"compute.ops_on_diff_frames\", True)\r\n>>> df1 = ps.DataFrame({'A': [None, 0], 'B': [None, 4]})\r\n>>> df2 = ps.DataFrame({'A': [1, 1], 'B': [3, 3]})\r\n>>> df1.combine_first(df2).sort_index()\r\n     A    B\r\n0  1.0  3.0\r\n1  0.0  4.0\r\n\r\n# Null values still persist if the location of that null value does not exist in other\r\n\r\n>>> df1 = ps.DataFrame({'A': [None, 0], 'B': [4, None]})\r\n>>> df2 = ps.DataFrame({'B': [3, 3], 'C': [1, 1]}, index=[1, 2])\r\n>>> df1.combine_first(df2).sort_index()\r\n     A    B    C\r\n0  NaN  4.0

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fixing. Aggregates over no grouping keys should return a single row.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new test in

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSeveral Spark ML components already allow setting of an initial model, including KMeans, LogisticRegression, and GaussianMixture. This is useful to begin training from a known reasonably good model.\r\n\r\nHowever, the method in LogisticRegression is private to Spark. I don't see a good reason why it should be as the others in KMeans et al are not.\r\n\r\nNone of these are exposed in Pyspark, which I don't necessarily want to question or deal with now; there are other places one could arguably set an initial model too, but, here just interested in exposing the existing, tested functionality to callers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nOther than the new API method, no.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-11T15:52:41Z","updated_at":"2021-09-10T12:54:30Z","closed_at":"2021-08-11T23:21:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d14fd3e8b3eb213936a8ccdad883843612d30031","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33710/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33710/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33710/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bfb43efddb2e492187fb18b6202f8db73b151650","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-36481","ref":"SPARK-36481","sha":"bfb43efddb2e492187fb18b6202f8db73b151650","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use the `CAST` logic when the pattern is not specified in `DateFormatter` or `TimestampFormatter`. In particular, invoke the `DateTimeUtils.stringToTimestampAnsi()` or `stringToDateAnsi()` in the case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. This can improve user experience with Spark SQL by making the default date/timestamp parsers more flexible and tolerant to their inputs.\r\n2. We make the default case consistent to the behavior of the `CAST` expression which makes implementation more consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe changes shouldn't introduce behavior change in regular cases but it can influence on corner cases. New implementation is able to parse more dates/timestamps by default. For instance, old (current) date parses can recognize dates only in the format **yyyy-MM-dd** but new one can handle:\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*`\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m`\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m-[d]d`\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m-[d]d `\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m-[d]d *`\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m-[d]dT*`\r\n\r\nSimilarly for timestamps. The old (current) timestamp formatter is able to parse timestamps only in the format **yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss** by default, but new implementation can handle:\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*`\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m`\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m-[d]d`\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m-[d]d `\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m-[d]d [h]h:[m]m:[s]s.[ms][ms][ms][us][us][us][zone_id]`\r\n   * `[+-]yyyy*-[m]m-[d]dT[h]h:[m]m:[s]s.[ms][ms][ms][us][us][us][zone_id]`\r\n   * `[h]h:[m]m:[s]s.[ms][ms][ms][us][us][us][zone_id]`\r\n   * `T[h]h:[m]m:[s]s.[ms][ms][ms][us][us][us][zone_id]`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ImageFileFormatSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetV2PartitionDiscoverySuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-08-11T14:03:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T06:15:24Z","closed_at":"2021-08-16T15:29:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05ffbd9dc049360a381831efa49eaee8bed081a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6a3c61f654903d5764b3d3546cf557e156b7464","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:datetime-cast-default-pattern","ref":"datetime-cast-default-pattern","sha":"c6a3c61f654903d5764b3d3546cf557e156b7464","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark should check result plan's output schema name\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn current code, some optimizer rule may change plan's output schema, since in the code we always use semantic equal to check output, but it may change the plan's output schema.\r\nFor example, for SchemaPruning, if we have a plan\r\n```\r\nProject[a, B]\r\n|--Scan[A, b, c]\r\n```\r\nthe origin output schema is `a, B`, after SchemaPruning. it become\r\n```\r\nProject[A, b]\r\n|--Scan[A, b]\r\n```\r\nIt change the plan's schema. when we use CTAS, the schema is same as query plan's output.\r\nThen since we change the schema, it not consistent with origin SQL. So we need to check final result plan's schema with origin plan's schema\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisted UT\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-11T08:54:12Z","updated_at":"2021-08-25T05:54:58Z","closed_at":"2021-08-25T05:54:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69d569469de44645984e8e721ef42b01541fe2f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33703/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33703/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33703/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6a80c348312b6f95e1c4c3caa08ed4e40c266a5","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-36352-3.1","ref":"SPARK-36352-3.1","sha":"e6a80c348312b6f95e1c4c3caa08ed4e40c266a5","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs a followup from discussion in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29804#discussion_r493229395 , currently the query plan for data source v1 scan operator - `FileSourceScanExec` has no information to indicate whether the table is read as bucketed table or not. And if table not read as bucketed table, what's the reason behind it. Add this info into `FileSourceScanExec` physical query plan output, can help users and developers understand query plan more easily without spending a lot of time debugging why table is not read as bucketed table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nHelp users and developers debug query plan for bucketed table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe added `Bucketed` information in physical query plan when reading bucketed table.\r\nNote for reading non-bucketed table, the query plan stays same and nothing is changed.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSeq((1, 2), (2, 3)).toDF(\"i\", \"j\").write.bucketBy(8, \"i\").saveAsTable(\"t1\")\r\nSeq(2, 3).toDF(\"i\").write.bucketBy(8, \"i\").saveAsTable(\"t2\")\r\nval df1 = spark.table(\"t1\")\r\nval df2 = spark.table(\"t2\")\r\ndf1.join(df2, df1(\"i\") === df2(\"i\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- SortMergeJoin [i#20], [i#24], Inner\r\n   :- Sort [i#20 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   :  +- Filter isnotnull(i#20)\r\n   :     +- FileScan parquet default.t1[i#20,j#21] Batched: true, Bucketed: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#20)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sq..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int>, SelectedBucketsCount: 8 out of 8\r\n   +- Sort [i#24 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n      +- Filter isnotnull(i#24)\r\n         +- FileScan parquet default.t2[i#24] Batched: true, Bucketed: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#24)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sq..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int>, SelectedBucketsCount: 8 out of 8\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

In particular, this introduces the following changes:\r\n1. Added a new class `ParquetType` which binds a Spark type with its corresponding  Parquet definition & repetition level. This is used when Spark assembles a vector of complex type for Parquet.\r\n2. Changed `ParquetSchemaConverter` and added a new method `convertTypeInfo` which converts a Parquet `MessageType` to a `ParquetType` above. The existing conversion logic in the class remains the same but now operates with `ParquetType` instead of `DataType`, and annotate the former with extra information such as definition & repetition level, column path, column descriptor, etc.\r\n3. Added a new class `ParquetColumn` which encapsulates all the necessary information needed when reading a Parquet column, including the `ParquetType` for the column, the repetition & definition levels (only allocated for a leaf-node of a complex type), as well as the reader for the column. In addition, it also contains logic for assembling nested columnar batches, via interpreting Parquet repetition & definition levels. \r\n4. Changes are made in `VectorizedParquetRecordReader` to initialize a list of `ParquetColumn` for the columns read.\r\n5. `VectorizedColumnReader` now also creates a reader for repetition column. Depending on whether maximum repetition level is 0, the batch read is now split into two code paths, e.g., `readBatch` versus `readBatchNested`.\r\n6. Added logic to handle complex type in `VectorizedRleValuesReader`. For data types involving only struct or primitive types, it still goes with the old `readBatch` method which now also saves definition levels into a vector for later assembly. Otherwise, for data types involving array or map, a separate code path `readBatchNested` is introduced to handle repetition levels.\r\n7. Added a new config `spark.sql.parquet.enableNestedColumnVectorizedReader` to turn on or turn off the feature. By default it is true.\r\n8. Modified `WritableColumnVector` to better support null structs. Currently it requires populating null entries to all child vectors when there is a null struct, however this will waste space and also doesn't work well with Parquet scan. This adds an extra field `structOffsets` which records the mapping from a row ID to the position of the row in the child vector, so that child vectors will only need to store real null elements.\r\n\r\nTo test this, the PR introduced an interface `ParquetRowGroupReader ` in `SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase` to abstract the Parquet file reading logic. The bulk of the tests are in `ParquetVectorizedSuite` which covers different batch size & page size, column index, first row index, nulls, etc.\r\n\r\nThe `DataSourceReadBenchmark` is extended with two more cases: reading struct fields of primitive types and reading array of struct & map field. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhenever read schema containing complex types, at the moment Spark will fallback to the row-based reader in parquet-mr, which is much slower. As benchmark shows, by adding support into the vectorized reader, we can get ~15x on average speed up on reading struct fields, and ~1.5x when reading array of struct and map.\r\n\r\nMicro benchmark of reading primitive fields from a struct, over 400m rows:\r\n```\r\n================================================================================================\r\nSQL Single Numeric Column Scan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement `Index.map`.\r\n\r\nThe PR is based on https://github.com/databricks/koalas/pull/2136. Thanks @awdavidson for the prototype.\r\n\r\n`map` of CategoricalIndex and DatetimeIndex will be implemented in separate PRs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMapping values using input correspondence (a dict, Series, or function) is supported in pandas as [Index.map](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Index.map.html).\r\nWe shall also support hat.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. `Index.map` is available now.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> psidx = ps.Index([1, 2, 3])\r\n\r\n>>> psidx.map({1: \"one\", 2: \"two\", 3: \"three\"})\r\nIndex(['one', 'two', 'three'], dtype='object')\r\n                                  \r\n>>> psidx.map(lambda id: \"{id} + 1\".format(id=id))\r\nIndex(['1 + 1', '2 + 1', '3 + 1'], dtype='object')\r\n\r\n>>> pser = pd.Series([\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"], index=[1, 2, 3])\r\n>>> psidx.map(pser)\r\nIndex(['one', 'two', 'three'], dtype='object')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch supports dynamic gap duration in session window.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe gap duration used in session window for now is a static value. To support more complex usage, it is better to support dynamic gap duration which determines the gap duration by looking at the current data. For example, in our usecase, we may have different gap by looking at the certain column in the input rows.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users can specify dynamic gap duration.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nModified existing tests and new test.","created_at":"2021-08-10T05:52:06Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:27:28Z","closed_at":"2021-08-16T02:06:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd14010140c0f86ebdc4fde63b7d9ef98ce01643","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `size` method of `ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream` returns a `Long` value; however, the underlying `_size` variable is initialized as `Int`.\r\nThat causes an overflow and returns a negative size when over 2GB data is written into `ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream`\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change the underlying `_size` variable from `Int` to `Long` at the initialization\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBe cause the `size` method of `ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream` incorrectly returns a negative value when over 2GB data is written.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPassed existing tests\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"core/testOnly *ChunkedByteBufferOutputStreamSuite\"\r\n```\r\nAlso added a new unit test\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"core/testOnly *ChunkedByteBufferOutputStreamSuite – -z

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to prohibit update mode in streaming aggregation with session window.\r\n\r\nUnsupportedOperationChecker will check and prohibit the case. As a side effect, this PR also simplifies the code as we can remove the implementation of iterator to support outputs of update mode.\r\n\r\nThis PR also cleans up test code via deduplicating.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe semantic of \"update\" mode for session window based streaming aggregation is quite unclear.\r\n\r\nFor normal streaming aggregation, Spark will provide the outputs which can be \"upsert\"ed based on the grouping key. This is based on the fact grouping key won't be changed.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't hold true for session window based streaming aggregation, as session range is changing.\r\n\r\nIf end users leverage their knowledge about streaming aggregation, they will consider the key as grouping key + session (since they'll specify these things in groupBy), and it's high likely possible that existing row is not updated (overwritten) and ended up with having different rows.\r\n\r\nIf end users consider the key as grouping key, there's a small chance for end users to upsert the session correctly, though only the last updated session will be stored so it won't work with event time processing which there could be multiple active sessions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as we haven't released this feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated tests.","created_at":"2021-08-10T03:34:19Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T01:46:04Z","closed_at":"2021-08-11T01:46:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cb740204737d4d0765723fd7d9fc75060746b1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPull out NoOpMergedShuffleFileManager inner class outside. This is required since passing dollar sign ($) for the config (`spark.shuffle.server.mergedShuffleFileManagerImpl`) value can be an issue. Currently `spark.shuffle.server.mergedShuffleFileManagerImpl` is by default set to `org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.ExternalBlockHandler$NoOpMergedShuffleFileManager`. After this change the default value be set to `org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.NoOpMergedShuffleFileManager`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPassing `$` for the config value can be an issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSuggesting to refactor the way the _builtin_table is defined in the `python/pyspark/pandas/groupby.py` module.\r\nPandas has recently refactored the way we import the _builtin_table and is now part of the pandas.core.common module instead of being an attribute of the pandas.core.base.SelectionMixin class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change is not fully needed but the current implementation redefines this table within pyspark, so any changes of this table from the pandas library would need to be updated in the pyspark repository as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan the following command successfully :\r\n```sh\r\npython/run-tests --testnames 'pyspark.pandas.tests.test_groupby'\r\n```\r\nTests passed in 327

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are some compilation warnings related to `method closeQuietly in class IOUtils is deprecated`,  `Apache commons-io` suggests that we should use the `try-with-resources` statement or handle suppressed exceptions manually.\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr is replace  `o.a.commons.io.IOUtils.closeQuietly` with `o.a.s.network.util.JavaUtils.closeQuietly` directly because all original logic is suppressing `IOException`.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up compilation warnings related to `method closeQuietly in class IOUtils is deprecated`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new example of complex sessionization, which leverages flatMapGroupsWithState.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe have replaced an example of sessionization from flatMapGroupsWithState to native support of session window. Given there are still use cases on sessionization which native support of session window cannot cover, it would be nice if we can demonstrate such case. It will also be used as an example of flatMapGroupsWithState.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. Example data is given in class

owner:abc, createTime:1627994412, lastAccessTime:0, retention:0, sd:StorageDescriptor(cols:[FieldSchema(name:id, type:string, comment:null), FieldSchema(name:c1, type:map<int,string>, comment:null)], location:/user/hive/warehouse/complex2, inputFormat:org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat, outputFormat:org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat, compressed:false, numBuckets:-1\r\n\r\nselect * from complex2;\r\nOK\r\n1 {1:\"u\"}\r\n2 {1:\"u\",2:\"uo\"}\r\n1 {1:\"u\",2:\"uo\"}\r\nTime taken: 0.363 seconds, Fetched: 3 row(s)\r\n\r\nWorking Scenario in Hive -: \r\n\r\nselect id, c1, count(*) from complex2 group by id, c1;\r\nOK\r\n1 {1:\"u\"} 1\r\n1 {1:\"u\",2:\"uo\"} 1\r\n2 {1:\"u\",2:\"uo\"} 1\r\nTime taken: 1.621 seconds, Fetched: 3 row(s)\r\n\r\nFailed Scenario in Hive -: \r\nWhen map type is present in aggregated expression \r\nselect id, max(c1), count(*) from complex2 group by id, c1; \r\nFAILED: UDFArgumentTypeException Cannot support comparison of map<> type or complex type containing map<>.\r\n```\r\nBut in spark where the group by map column failed for this scenario where the map column is used in the select without any aggregation, The one that works in hive.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select id,c1, count(*) from complex2 group by id, c1\").show\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: expression spark_catalog.default.complex2.`c1` cannot be used as a grouping expression because its data type map<int,string> is not an orderable data type.;\r\nAggregate [id#1, c1#2], [id#1, c1#2, count(1) AS count(1)#3L]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.complex2\r\n +- HiveTableRelation [`default`.`complex2`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, Data Cols: [id#1, c1#2], Partition Cols: []]\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis.failAnalysis(CheckAnalysis.scala:50)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is need to add the this scenario where grouping expression can have map type if aggregated expression does not have the that map type reference. This helps in migrating the user from hive to Spark.\r\n\r\nAfter the code change \r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select id,c1, count(*) from complex2 group by id, c1\").show\r\n+---+-----------------+--------+                                                \r\n| id|               c1|count(1)|\r\n+---+-----------------+--------+\r\n|  1|         {1 -> u}|       1|\r\n|  2|{1 -> u, 2 -> uo}|       1|\r\n|  1|{1 -> u, 2 -> uo}|       1|\r\n+---+-----------------+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded the unit test and also tested using spark-shell the scenario\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-08T13:14:15Z","updated_at":"2021-11-19T00:12:20Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T00:12:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7ece8612d59ca76edf33429da00e65cbc477b77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33679/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33679/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33679/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a09e37faec1be04a20785846f9a2b53c8fdfd663","head":{"label":"SaurabhChawla100:SPARK-36452","ref":"SPARK-36452","sha":"a09e37faec1be04a20785846f9a2b53c8fdfd663","user":{"login":"SaurabhChawla100","id":34540906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTQwOTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34540906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100","html_url":"https://github.com/SaurabhChawla100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235058981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzUwNTg5ODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"SaurabhChawla100/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SaurabhChawla100","id":34540906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTQwOTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34540906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100","html_url":"https://github.com/SaurabhChawla100","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SaurabhChawla100/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SaurabhChawla100/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change allows a spark user to provide a class which implements fabric's OAuthTokenProvider to refresh tokens throughout the life of the spark app.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.kubernetes.authenticate.submission.oauthTokenProvider=<token>\r\nspark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.oauthTokenProvider=<token>\r\nspark.kubernetes.authenticate.oauthTokenProvider=<token>\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://javadoc.io/doc/io.fabric8/kubernetes-client/5.6.0/io/fabric8/kubernetes/client/OAuthTokenProvider.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, while running spark on kubernetes, one should specify oauth tokens via config before starting an application.\r\n```\r\nspark.kubernetes.authenticate.submission.oauthToken=<token>\r\nspark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.oauthToken=<token>\r\nspark.kubernetes.authenticate.oauthToken=<token>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe token has an expiration time (usually an hour, for GKE) and there is no way to update the token in the runtime. The spark app starts to throw exceptions.\r\n```\r\nio.fabric8.kubernetes.client.KubernetesClientException: Unauthorized\r\n\tat io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.dsl.internal.WatchConnectionManager$1.onFailure(WatchConnectionManager.java:202)\r\n\tat okhttp3.internal.ws.RealWebSocket.failWebSocket(RealWebSocket.java:571)\r\n\tat okhttp3.internal.ws.RealWebSocket$2.onResponse(RealWebSocket.java:198)\r\n\tat okhttp3.RealCall$AsyncCall.execute(RealCall.java:203)\r\n\tat okhttp3.internal.NamedRunnable.run(NamedRunnable.java:32)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1128)\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:628)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA class which implements OAuthTokenProvider interface[0] was added into the classpath on driver node with no other spark options for tokens specified \r\nIt was also tested with expired tokens specified, and the token was updated via the user-provided class.\r\n```\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.submission.oauthToken=<expired>\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.oauthToken=<expired> \r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.authenticate.oauthToken=<expired>\r\n```\r\nThere is no need to use any other token-related configuration options if this class is provided.\r\n\r\nAn example of the user-provided class for GKE\r\n[0] https://gist.github.com/haodemon/5490fefdb258275c1f805d584319090b\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.OAuthTokenProvider\r\n\r\nclass OAuthGoogleTokenProvider extends OAuthTokenProvider {\r\n  private val binary = \"gcloud\"\r\n  private val args = \"config config-helper --format=json\"\r\n\r\n  override def getToken: String = {\r\n    val response = (binary + \" \" + args).!!\r\n    val token = new ObjectMapper().readTree(response)\r\n      .get(\"credential\")\r\n      .get(\"access_token\")\r\n    token.getTextValue\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd the credentials from previous JobConf into the new JobConf to reuse the FileSystem Delegation Token.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark Job creates a new JobConf (which will have a new Credentials) for every hive table partition, the token is not reused and gets fetched for every partition. This is slowing down the query as each delegation token has to go through KDC and SSL handshake on Secure Clusters.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, while user querying partitioned hive table.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange all exceptions in NoSuchItemException.scala to case classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExceptions in NoSuchItemException.scala are not case classes. This is causing issues because in Analyzer's executeAndCheck method always calls the `copy` method on the exception. However, since these exceptions are not case classes, the `copy` method was always delegated to `AnalysisException::copy`, which is not the specialized version.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes an existing correctness issue where a non-deterministic With-CTE can be executed multiple times producing different results, by deferring the inline of With-CTE to after the analysis stage. This fix also provides the future opportunity of performance improvement by executing deterministic With-CTEs only once in some circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe major changes include:\r\n1. Added new With-CTE logical nodes: `CTERelationDef`, `CTERelationRef`, `WithCTE`. Each `CTERelationDef` has a unique ID and the mapping between CTE def and CTE ref is based on IDs rather than names. `WithCTE` is a resolved version of `With`, only that: 1) `WithCTE` is a multi-children logical node so that most logical rules can automatically apply to CTE defs; 2) In the main query and each subquery, there can only be at most one `WithCTE`, which means nested With-CTEs are combined.\r\n2. Changed `CTESubstitution` rule so that if NOT in legacy mode, CTE defs will not be inlined immediately, but rather transformed into a `CTERelationRef` per reference.\r\n3. Added new With-CTE rules: 1) `ResolveWithCTE` - to update `CTERelationRef`s with resolved output from corresponding `CTERelationDef`s; 2) `InlineCTE` - to inline deterministic CTEs or non-deterministic CTEs with only ONE reference; 3) `UpdateCTERelationStats` - to update stats for `CTERelationRef`s that are not inlined.\r\n4. Added a CTE physical planning strategy to plan `CTERelationRef`s as an independent shuffle with round-robin partitioning so that such CTEs will only be materialized once and different references will later be a shuffle reuse.\r\n\r\nA current limitation is that With-CTEs mixed with SQL commands or DMLs will still go through the old inline code path because of our non-standard language specs and not-unified command/DML interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a correctness issue. Non-deterministic CTEs should produce the same output regardless of how many times it is referenced/used in query, while under the current implementation there is no such guarantee and would lead to incorrect query results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UTs.\r\nRegenerated golden files for TPCDS plan stability tests. There is NO change to the `simplified.txt` files, the only differences are expression IDs.","created_at":"2021-08-06T18:28:32Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T12:09:36Z","closed_at":"2021-08-13T03:37:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4679d1c50c021897342b1c7d46cb66e006a2702f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33671/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33671/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33671/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4cc52f74ab8a12599b74ae163e8f4065a99e359d","head":{"label":"maryannxue:spark-36447","ref":"spark-36447","sha":"4cc52f74ab8a12599b74ae163e8f4065a99e359d","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nImplement a new rule for the date-time operations in the ANSI type coercion system:\r\n1. Date will be converted to Timestamp when it is in the subtraction with Timestmap.\r\n2. Promote string literals in date_add/date_sub/time_add\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently the type coercion rule `DateTimeOperations` doesn't match the design of the ANSI type coercion system:\r\n1. For date_add/date_sub, if the input is timestamp type, Spark should not convert it into date type since date type is narrower than the timestamp type.\r\n2. For date_add/date_sub/time_add, string value can be implicit cast to date/timestamp only when it is literal.\r\n\r\nThus, we need to have a new rule for the date-time operations in the ANSI type coercion system.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the ANSI type coercion rules are not releaesd.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith ANSI mode, `SELECT make_timestamp(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)` fails, because the 'seconds' parameter needs to be of type DECIMAL(8,6), and INT can't be implicitly casted to DECIMAL(8,6) under ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException\r\ncannot resolve 'make_timestamp(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)' due to data type mismatch: argument 6 requires decimal(8,6) type, however, '1' is of int type.; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should update the function `make_timestamp` to allow integer type 'seconds' parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake `make_timestamp` could accepts integer as 'seconds' parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\n`make_timestamp` could accepts

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a performance regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33172\r\n\r\nBefore #33172 , the target size is adaptively calculated based on the default parallelism of the spark cluster. Sometimes it's very small and #33172 sets a min partition size to fix perf issues. Sometimes the calculated size is reasonable, such as dozens of MBs.\r\n\r\nAfter #33172 , we no longer calculate the target size adaptively, and by default always coalesce the partitions into 1 MB. This can cause perf regression if the adaptively calculated size is reasonable.\r\n\r\nThis PR brings back the code that adaptively calculate the target size based on the default parallelism of the spark cluster.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently in `V2ScanRelationPushDown`, we push the filters (partition filters + data filters) to file source, and then pass all the filters (partition filters + data filters) as post scan filters to v2 Scan, and later in `PruneFileSourcePartitions`, we separate partition filters and data filters, set them in the format of `Expression` to file source.  \r\n\r\nChanges in this PR:\r\nWhen we push filters to file sources in `V2ScanRelationPushDown`, since we already have the information about partition column , we want to separate partition filter and data filter there.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of doing this:\r\n- we can handle all the filter related work for v2 file source at one place instead of two (`V2ScanRelationPushDown` and `PruneFileSourcePartitions`), so the code will be cleaner and easier to maintain. \r\n- we actually have to separate partition filters and data filters at `V2ScanRelationPushDown`, otherwise, there is no way to find out which filters are partition filters, and we can't push down aggregate for parquet even if we only have partition filter.\r\n- By separating the filters early at `V2ScanRelationPushDown`, we only needs to check data filters to find out which one needs to be converted to data source filters (e.g. Parquet predicates, ORC predicates) and pushed down to file source, right now we are checking all the filters (both partition filters and data filters)\r\n- Similarly, we can only pass data filters as post scan filters to v2 Scan, because partition filters are used for partition pruning only, no need to pass them as post scan filters.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, we will have the following changes\r\n\r\n-  add `pushFilters` in file source v2. In this method:\r\n    - push both Expression partition filter and Expression data filter to file source. Have to use Expression filters because we need these for partition pruning.\r\n    - data filters are used for filter push down. If file source needs to push down data filters, it translates the data filters from `Expression` to `Sources.Filer`, and then decides which filters to push down.\r\n    - partition filters are used for partition pruning.\r\n- file source v2 no need to implement `SupportsPushdownFilters` any more, because when we separating the two types of filters, we have already set them on file data sources.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nOn the client side, we are currently randomizing the order of push requests before processing each request. In addition we can further randomize the order of blocks within each push request before pushing them.\r\nIn our benchmark, this has resulted in a 60%-70% reduction of blocks that fail to be merged due to bock collision (the existing block merge ratio is already pretty good in general, and this further improves it).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove block merge ratio for push-based shuffle\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nStraightforward small change, no additional test
