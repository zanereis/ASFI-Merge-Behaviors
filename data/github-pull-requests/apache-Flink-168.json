you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the CSV table factory requires `format.fields.`, which makes it hard to use. This PR makes CSV table factory supports `deriveSchema` property to derive schema from DDL body part and avoid to pass `format.fields.` properties.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add a `deriveSchema` property to derive schema from `schema.*` properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Add a `CsvTableSinkFactoryTest` to verify source and sink table factory. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix JDBCLookupFunction getFieldFromResultSet bug, if one column was NULL(SQL) then the next column will be NULL even though it is not null\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *fix JDBCLookupFunction getFieldFromResultSet bug*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n  - *This change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage*\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  \r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n-->\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\nWe plan some steps for FLINK ARM support, taking *flink-core* and *flink-test* related modules as the first targets:\r\n\r\n1. Add the basic build script to ensure the CI system and build job works as expect.  Add the test script to run unit/intergration/e2e test. At this step the --fn parameter will be added to mvn test. It will run the full test cases in Flink, so that we can find what test is failed on ARM.\r\n\r\n2. Once all the tests are passed, remove the --fn parameter and keep watch the CI's status for some days. If some bugs raise then, fix them as what we usually do for travis-ci.\r\n\r\n3. Once the CI is stable enought, we can then change cron job to each-pr trigger job, so that the ARM CI will be the same as travis-ci, to be one of the gate for Flink PR.\r\n\r\n4. Finally, Flink community can announce and release Flink ARM version.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first step that adding the basic ARM CI job definition script for *flink-core*, *flink-test* build and *flink-e2e-test*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add job definition file (.zuul.yaml).\r\n- Add job execution file (files in openlab folder).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added new CI and can be verified through the CI report.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-12T02:33:31Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T08:58:27Z","closed_at":"2019-10-23T02:10:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad9166d0966e0ad9143362976850f140732e30eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem","name":"component=BuildSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c04cdffac657ff1fb10a2a34855e05b94bafd564","head":{"label":"wangxiyuan:add_arm_ci","ref":"add_arm_ci","sha":"c04cdffac657ff1fb10a2a34855e05b94bafd564","user":{"login":"wangxiyuan","id":10891919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODkxOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10891919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/wangxiyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194633053,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2MzMwNTM=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangxiyuan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangxiyuan","id":10891919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODkxOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10891919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/wangxiyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangxiyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangxiyuan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Translate \"Apache Kafka Connector\" page into Chinese*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *I modified the kafka.zh.md file .*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*I have verified the changes by starting the build script in preview mode.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no )\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no )\r\n  - The serializers: ( no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: ( no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (  no )\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? ( not documented )\r\n\r\n@wuchong  @TisonKun \r\nPlease Take A Look .\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-10T09:24:34Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T08:28:41Z","closed_at":"2019-09-25T02:54:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cff0f5a742e2e675b6c8169fa3113e73fd4d6331","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278841078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODQxMDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=chinese-translation","name":"component=chinese-translation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9415/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9415/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9415/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8bf4e488f3fab10c9661922ad418fb7135715c8a","head":{"label":"highfei2011:FLINK-12939","ref":"FLINK-12939","sha":"8bf4e488f3fab10c9661922ad418fb7135715c8a","user":{"login":"highfei2011","id":18230501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjMwNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18230501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011","html_url":"https://github.com/highfei2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":201595570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDE1OTU1NzA=","name":"flink","full_name":"highfei2011/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"highfei2011","id":18230501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MjMwNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18230501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011","html_url":"https://github.com/highfei2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/highfei2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/highfei2011/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Translate \"Concepts -> Glossary\" page into Chinese.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *I modified the glossary.zh.md file .*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*I have  verified the changes by starting the build script in preview mode.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no )\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no )\r\n  - The serializers: ( no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: ( no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (  no )\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? ( not documented )\r\n\r\n@wuchong  @TisonKun  \r\nPlease Take A Look

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nVectorToColumnsMapper maps one vector to many column objects.  The number of columns equals to vector size.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Add VectorToColumnsMapper for mapping Op.*\r\n- *Add VectorToColumnsParams for parameters.*\r\n- *Add VectorToColumnsMapperTest for unit test.*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T15:33:00Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:31Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a88386f9feb44dd8aff03ed4336d737cb4237f75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/66c62a8e028ccf7ff8be989ee30b272e9bada56d","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:vectortocolumns","ref":"vectortocolumns","sha":"66c62a8e028ccf7ff8be989ee30b272e9bada56d","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nVectorSlicerMapper maps a vector to a thin vector , which define by input indices.  It is useful for extracting features from a vector column.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Add VectorSliceMapper for mapping Op.*\r\n- *Add VectorSliceMapperTest  for unit test.* \r\n- *Add VectorSliceParams  for parameters.*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T15:29:33Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:31Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0327ab7efb9e9279ab552bf37da38cb0c5f99d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/55e76e5d450f112e1500036c79cbd4743fcd5889","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:vectorslicemapper","ref":"vectorslicemapper","sha":"55e76e5d450f112e1500036c79cbd4743fcd5889","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nVectorSizeHintMapper maps a vector to one or zero vector. If vector size is right, vector will be output. If vector size is not right or vector is null, then it will be processed by handle invalid type.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Add VectorSizeHintMapper for mapping Op.*\r\n- *Add VectorSizeHintMapperTest  for unit test.* \r\n- *Add VectorSizeHintParams  for parameters.*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T15:26:02Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:30Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"749a2f948e297d28d4051ab3b65b4aa38bc9492f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9411/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9411/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9411/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9cffa68773935aeb4fc7f92c87cafa940ea57944","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:vectorsizehintmapper","ref":"vectorsizehintmapper","sha":"9cffa68773935aeb4fc7f92c87cafa940ea57944","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nNormalizerMapper maps a vector  to a new one which is normalized.  It takes parameter p, which specifies the p-norm used for normalization. This normalization can help standardize your\r\ninput data and improve the behavior of learning algorithms. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Add VectorNormalizeMapper for mapping Op.*\r\n- *Add VectorNormalizeMapperTest  for unit test.* \r\n- *Add VectorNormalizeParams  for parameters.*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T15:22:20Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:30Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f45295f66cbc514a0d9730aa7156bf2dd3486de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9410/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9410/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9410/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e08c7de638ed3770aa4b6808d68704b7672830b3","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:vectornormalizemapper","ref":"vectornormalizemapper","sha":"e08c7de638ed3770aa4b6808d68704b7672830b3","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nVectorInteraction transfroms two vectors or double-valued columns into a single vector column that contains the product of all combinations of one value from each input column.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  ⁃  *Add VectorInteractionMapper for the operation of the vector interaction.*\r\n  ⁃  *Add VectorInteractionParams for the parameters of VectorInteractionMapper.*\r\n  ⁃  *Add VectorInteractionMapperTest for the test example.*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T15:18:12Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:29Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2133bbab861661c9694bf3f2c8aef0fd29c54727","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c95ee221f9ba6098a7f9e70b66c46a6667a44d8c","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:vectorinteractionmapper","ref":"vectorinteractionmapper","sha":"c95ee221f9ba6098a7f9e70b66c46a6667a44d8c","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nVectorEleWiseProduct multiplies each input vector by a provided “scaling” vector, using element-wise multiplication. In other words, it scales each column of the dataset by a scalar multiplier. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  ⁃  *Add VectorEleWiseProductMapper for the operation of the vector elewise production.*\r\n  ⁃  *Add VectorElementwiseProductParams for the parameters of VectorEleWiseProductMapper.*\r\n  ⁃  *Add ElementwiseProductMapperTest for the test example.*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T15:13:54Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:29Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"113e585e0c9bf804ade53287fe6ff4414bfa5316","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9408/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9408/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9408/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b14008db52a3171fc39b7863f440741a9c536039","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:vectorelewiseproductmapper","ref":"vectorelewiseproductmapper","sha":"b14008db52a3171fc39b7863f440741a9c536039","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nVectorAssembler is a transformer that combines a given list of columns(vector or numerical column) into a single vector column. VectorAssembler accepts the following input column types: all numeric types, and vector type. In each row, the values of the input columns will be concatenated into a vector in the specified order.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  ⁃  *Add VectorAssemblerMapper for the operation of the vector assemble.*\r\n  ⁃  *Add VectorAssemblerParams for the parameters of VectorAssemblerMapper.*\r\n  ⁃  *Add VectorAssemblerMapperTest for the test example.*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T15:07:35Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:28Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3797ddb3caf5cffecbe1adda025efc690f85de87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9407/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9407/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9407/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/40621b28dc8bd9098d56e53b8893824e82205614","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:vectorassemblermapper","ref":"vectorassemblermapper","sha":"40621b28dc8bd9098d56e53b8893824e82205614","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBinarizerMapper is a transformer to binarize a continuous variable using a threshold. The features greater than the threshold will be binarized 1.0 and the features equal to or less than threshold will be binarized to 0. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Add BinarizerMapper for the operation of the binarizer.*\r\n- *Add BinarizerParams for the params of BinarizerMapper.*\r\n- *Add BinarizerMapperTest for the test example.*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T15:00:23Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:28Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:06:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0fd038e7b0ae4e16ddcb56bb0b0dd60255e7143","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9406/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9406/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9406/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/525deec064b49a1221e0a963d79440721045e3a4","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:binarizermapper","ref":"binarizermapper","sha":"525deec064b49a1221e0a963d79440721045e3a4","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd abstract classes for three typical scenarios of (Flat)Mapper. \r\n\r\nFlatMapper transforms one Row type data into zero, one, or more Row type result data, and Mapper transforms one Row type data into one Row type result data. For most of practical scenarios, the outputs are single column. Using these extend classes, we can be more focus on the algorithm development.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add SISOFlatMapper for the Single Input column and Single Output column scenario.*\r\n  - *Add SISOMapper for the Single Input column and Single Output column scenario*\r\n  - *Add MISOMapper for the Multi Input column and Single Output column scenario*\r\n  - *Add Param definition for SISOFlatMapper*\r\n  - *Add Param definition for SISOMapper*\r\n  - *Add Param definition for MISOMapper*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T12:23:22Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:07:00Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:07:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd9c4c668fc5af3f421383162c81351e58f6730a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9405/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9405/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/aa63d46aa2beeffe3a581cf664929dc39f32769c","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:sisomisomapper","ref":"sisomisomapper","sha":"aa63d46aa2beeffe3a581cf664929dc39f32769c","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd the utility class for the Table \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add the operations on column name*\r\n  - *Add the operations on column type*\r\n  - *Add unit test case*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T10:27:43Z","updated_at":"2019-12-28T16:26:53Z","closed_at":"2019-12-28T16:26:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8364d79595cf557c837d7270a38b92762f161c52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9404/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9404/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9404/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3b28c422b180379b6a2249c393196143a2a2de37","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:tableutils","ref":"tableutils","sha":"3b28c422b180379b6a2249c393196143a2a2de37","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd an implement of collector with the row type\r\n\r\nthe RowCollector use list as container to collect the data using row type \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add the RowCollector*\r\n  - *Add unit test case*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-09T09:33:48Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T09:07:00Z","closed_at":"2022-05-17T09:07:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d776b714d8936edaacae4bbf1deae96347d02234","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/24d8508b97496d8db713e414d0b56ca35503b393","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:rowcollector","ref":"rowcollector","sha":"24d8508b97496d8db713e414d0b56ca35503b393","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAvoid crashing sql-client when switching to non-existing catalog or database.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Catch `CatalogException` thrown by TableEnvironment and throw a `SqlExecutionException` instead.\r\n  - Add test cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request ports window flatAggregate from Flink planner to Blink planner. \r\n\r\nThe changes mainly include two modules: blink-planner and blink-runtime. The code of the API part can be reused as the two planner share the same API.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nThis pr is further split into the following 4 commits:\r\n\r\n1. Add plan support for table aggregate. [0e875a2](https://github.com/sunjincheng121/flink/commit/0e875a20091a2b53a1614702ced7a7c3c9e117fa)\r\n  This commit adds RelNodes(Logical, FlinkLogical and StreamExec) and Rules in blink planner. The execution procedures are: \r\n  First, the WindowAggregate QueryOperation node in API level will be converted to a LogicalWindowTableAggregate relnode in `QueryOperationConverter`.\r\n  Second, the LogicalWindowTableAggregate will be converted to a FlinkLogicalWindowTableAggregate by the rule in logical optimization phase.\r\n  Third, the FlinkLogicalWindowTableAggregate will be converted to a StreamExecGroupWindowTableAggregate by the rule in physical optimization phase.\r\n\r\n2. Add runtime support for table aggregate. [a1120036](https://github.com/sunjincheng121/flink/commit/a1120036ae215e7831f6cdcc848f4188abc63780) \r\n  This commit adds codegen and window operator support for window table aggregete. \r\n  The AggCodeGen generates a NamespaceTableAggsHandleFunction which is used in the window operator.\r\n  For window operator, this commit refactors the previous window operator by adding a base window operator(`WindowOperator`) and two sub window operators(`AggregateWindowOperator` and `TableAggregateWindowOperator`).\r\n  Additionally, to make the refactor possible, this commit also change the window processing function(`InternalWindowProcessFunction`) by changing the `getWindowAggregationResult` method to `prepareAggregateAccumulatorForEmit`.\r\n  The `prepareAggregateAccumulatorForEmit` method returns the accumulator, with which the `AggregateWindowOperator` can use getValue to return result and the `TableAggregateWindowOperator` can use emitValue to return results.\r\n\r\n3. Add window operator tests for window table aggregate. [686ab9df](https://github.com/sunjincheng121/flink/commit/686ab9df908a914255fcc7bd6b447e42c79e2a9f\r\n) \r\n  Change the `WindowOperatorTest` into a parameterized test which can test both aggregate and table aggregate.\r\n  To simplify the testing logic, the table aggregate outputs same value with the aggregate except that the table aggregate outputs two same records each time.\r\n  \r\n4. Support WindowTableAggregate in some MetadataHandler. [9a5651f1d](https://github.com/sunjincheng121/flink/commit/9a5651f1dee8a7d5da17bc4e54831af55d7002c4)\r\n  MetadataHandler is used to provide Metadata of a relational expression. For example, provide the unique key information of a relnode. The information can be used during optimization.\r\n  This commit adds WindowTableAggregate support in `FlinkRelMdColumnInterval`, `FlinkRelMdFilteredColumnInterval` and `FlinkRelMdModifiedMonotonicity`. The absence of WindowTableAggregate in other MetadataHandlers mainly because:\r\n   \r\n- The WindowTableAggregate can not provide uniqueness information which is required in FlinkRelMdColumnUniqueness, FlinkRelMdDistinctRowCount, FlinkRelMdUniqueGroups, FlinkRelMdUniqueKeys. \r\n- Most of the MetadataHandlers are not been used in streaming jobs，such as FlinkRelMdPercentageOriginalRows，FlinkRelMdPopulationSize, FlinkRelMdRowCount, etc.\r\n\r\nBTW: I do not add the emitpolicy for window aggregate just we want align with Flink Planner.\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n - WindowOperatorContractTest\r\n - WindowOperatorTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

the wrong word used in the comments in class KeyedStream\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* This pull request correct the wrong word used in the comments in class KeyedStream...\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - replace `minimize` with `maximize` in the comments for max(int) function in class KeyedStream.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pull request increases the config value of akka.ask.timeout and web.timeout to fix akka timeout problem of the heavy deployment e2e test.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n Two config values are changed for the heavy deployment e2e test.\r\n - Increase the config value of akka.ask.timeout from default (10s) to 60s\r\n - Increase the config value of web.timeout form default (10,000ms) to 60,000ms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually verified the change by running ./flink-end-to-end-tests/run-single-test.sh ./flink-end-to-end-tests/test-scripts/test_heavy_deployment.sh 500 times locally and modified the .travis.yml config file to trigger heavy deployment test when pushing code and ran the test for more than 200 times on Travis. No akka timeout problem occurred any more.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the issue that Flink cannot access Hive table with decimal columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Avoid conversion between `DataType` and `TypeInformation` in several places.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFollow up on PubSub connector PR. This adds a retry mechanism to acknowledging pubsub messages. Google's PubSub is unstable enough for this to be a must-have imo.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTrivial change.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: Yes, unless we can add this to 1.9. The pubsub connector has not yet been released.\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): Yes, but only for the pubsub connector, not the flink core code.\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nHarden `RegionFailoverITCase` by recording info when checkpoint just completed to avoid the race condition in [FLINK-13601].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Harden `RegionFailoverITCase`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - We use `TestingCompletedCheckpointStore` to record information of checkpoints instead of previous `notifyCheckpointComplete` invoked on task side. This could avoid the race condition in [FLINK-13601](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-13601).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  -

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn a sequence like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntEnv.getConfig().setIdleStateRetentionTime(minRetention, maxRetention);\r\nTable table = tEnv.fromDataStream(elements);\r\ntEnv.toAppendStream(table, Row.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe call to toAppendStream will override the value set in tEnv.getConfig.setIdleStateRetentionTime. I think we should change that behavior, as we want to drop the version with explicit QueryConfig and recommend the described setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIf methods that do not specify QueryConfig explicitly are used in\r\nStreamTableEnvironment than the values from TableConfig will be used.\r\nIf methods that accept QueryConfig are used than those values will be\r\nused to overwrite the TableConfig.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests:\r\n* org.apache.flink.table.api.java.internal.StreamTableEnvironmentImplTest\r\n* org.apache.flink.table.api.scala.internal.StreamTableEnvironmentImplTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no /** don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no /** don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix behavior of several datetime builtin functions in blink planner.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. af3db19573d91acae9cc15e2186680b49b659fdd  Fix NOW() should return TIMESTAMP instead of BIGINT\r\n    This aligns the behavior to other systems (MySQL, Spark). Because NOW() is Synonyms for CURRENT_TIMESTAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. d3af9e280d705e51c1f3bc16908e5650c7a639ea  Fix UNIX_TIMESTAMP(string [,format]) should work in session time zone\r\n    This aligns the behavior to other systems (MySQL, Spark). UNIX_TIMESTAMP(string [,format]) is an inverse of FROM_UNIXTIME(bigint [,format]). We also remove the support of UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timestamp) in this commit.\r\n\r\n3. 5939a990cd86fc16141a39587e565988734162bc  Fix FROM_UNIXTIME(bigint [,format]) should work in session time zone\r\n    This aligns the behavior to other systems (MySQL, Spark).\r\n\r\n4. 584df370a4feb34b1ef1bdb4a81b60809dad7128  Drop TO_DATE(int) function support\r\n    This commit drops TO_DATE(int) function support in blink planner to align with other systems. We only support TO_DATE(string [,format]) in this version.\r\n\r\n5. 1a590b6d9c792b136a109cc5f3ad1ab3bf0f6916  Drop TO_TIMESTAMP(bigint) function support\r\n    This commit drops TO_TIMESTAMP(bigint) function support in blink planner to align with other systems. We only support TO_TIMESTAMP(string [,format]) in this version.\r\n\r\n6. 7dfb34225535a673c99baa4cd7b7dd0ed8a34783  Drop CONVERT_TZ(timestamp, format, from_tz, to_tz) function support\r\n    This commit drops CONVERT_TZ(timestamp, format, from_tz, to_tz) function support in blink planner to align with other systems. We only support CONVERT_TZ(timestamp, from_tz, to_tz) in this version.\r\n\r\n7. c2b09aa4f5c00eb5436e5f2e4ed1983657c9753e  Drop DATE_FORMAT(timestamp, from_format, to_format) function support\r\n    This commit drops DATE_FORMAT(timestamp, from_format, to_format) function support in blink planner to align with other systems. We only support DATE_FORMAT(timestamp, to_format) and DATE_FORMAT(string, to_format) in this version.\r\n\r\n8. 84be6c933af6b8a960df17f6767d620db7f3a59f  Remove some builtin datetime functions which can be covered by existing functions\r\n    Removes DATE_FORMAT_TZ, DATE_ADD,DATE_SUB, DATEDIFF, FROM_TIMESTAMP, TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ builtin functions which can be covered by existing functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests. For the functions changed behavior, we modified existing tests and add some more tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIf counting of mapper restarts in `BatchFineGrainedRecoveryITCase` is based on the open method of user function, the fact of the restart depends on internal implementation of the local Task and whether the open method is eventually called.\r\n\r\nIf execution attempt numbers are used instead, the test behaviour is more stable because it depends only on coordination. The execution attempt numbers can be queried from the REST client of the testing mini cluster.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce `MiniClusterClient` for `BatchFineGrainedRecoveryITCase` to query task attempts\r\n  - Use mapper task attempt numbers instead of user function open method call counters\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun `BatchFineGrainedRecoveryITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor the input data type is Table, but during the ML training process, we need use DataSet and DataStream type. Thus, we need the type transformation utils in the ML algorithm implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Add the transformation between DataSet and Table*\r\n- *Add the transformation between DataStream and Table*\r\n- *Add unit test cases*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-06T13:03:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T17:00:37Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T16:46:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a020da9bd21a9988ada54bf6c68133eff6bef08e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d773cea773b5a63c8515f0343319395e4d5463ee","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:tabletransformations","ref":"tabletransformations","sha":"d773cea773b5a63c8515f0343319395e4d5463ee","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue as reported in FLINK_13593, that due to the asynchronously handling of checkpoint decline message in `LegacyScheduler#declineCheckpoint`, it's possible that the message is handled before job status transition thus `receiveDeclineMessage` grabbed the lock in `CheckpointCoordinator` before `pendingCheckpoints` got cleared by `stopCheckpointScheduler` (as triggered by the job status listener `CheckpointCoordinatorDeActivator`). If the job/tasks restarts quickly enough, the FailJobCallback in CheckpointFailureManager might unexpectedly fail the job again.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd a safe guard when failing the job, passing through the `ExecutionAttemptID` and checking against the current executions to make sure the to-be-failed one is still running, so we won't fail the newly restarted one by accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe issue is revealed by the unstable failure of `KafkaProducerExactlyOnceITCase` thus is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are some transformation names are not set in blink planner. For example, LookupJoin transformation uses \"LookupJoin\" directly which loses a lot of informatoion.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Introduces a RelWriter `RelDisplayNameWriterImpl` to reuse code of \"explainTerms\" to generate operator names\r\n2. Fix some operator names are not set in blink planner\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce ActiveResourceManagerFactory which encapsulates the logic to set relevant\r\nconfiguration values for the active ResourceManager implementations (e.g. managed\r\nmemory).\r\n\r\nLet existing active ResourceManager factory implementations extend ActiveResourceManagerFactory.\r\n\r\nAdd ActiveResourceManagerFactoryTest to ensure that active ResourceManager relevant\r\nconfiguration values are set.\r\n\r\nAdd StandaloneResourceManagerFactoryTest to ensure that a standalone ResourceManager can be\r\nstarted if the memory size is configured to be less than the containered min cutoff size.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added `ActiveResourceManagerFactoryTest` and `StandaloneResourceManagerFactoryTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd an util class to build result row and generate result schema, which will be used in later algorithm implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add class OutputColsHelper.*\r\n  - *Add unit test*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- run test case pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-05T05:12:15Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T01:03:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T01:03:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8fc013e83feda21b02e9f3b8ebd28280c5dd243","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273165811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/MachineLearning","name":"component=Library/MachineLearning","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5aa99c1025af025ef3900a6e22a163c9a590094d","head":{"label":"xuyang1706:outputcolhelper","ref":"outputcolhelper","sha":"5aa99c1025af025ef3900a6e22a163c9a590094d","user":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189197846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxOTc4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuyang1706/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuyang1706","id":51157402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTU3NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51157402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706","html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuyang1706/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuyang1706/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Added a new flink-connector to connect RocketMQ cluster, then can implement the message producing and consumering with RocketMQ, and also the connector can be used as data souce or data sink to integrate Flink and RocketMQ cluster*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Added the RocketMQ sink and source implementation*\r\n  - *Added some unit test*\r\n  - *Added a pom.xml which includes the specail dependence about RocketMQ client version 3.2.6*\r\n  - *Added a simple README .md*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*the unit test can test some construct functions*\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes )\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe purpose of this PR is fix the broken heavy deployment e2e test. By adjusting three config values of the heavy deployment test, the cluster startup failure problem can be solved and the memory pressure of JM/TM can be reduced, which make the e2e test more stable.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nThree config values are changed for the heavy deployment e2e test.\r\n  - *Decrease config value of containerized.heap-cutoff-min from default (600M) to 100M*\r\n  - *Increase JobManager heap size from default (1024M) to 2048M*\r\n  - *Increase TaskManager heap size from 512M to 1024M*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nManually verified the change by running ./flink-end-to-end-tests/run-single-test.sh ./flink-end-to-end-tests/test-scripts/test_heavy_deployment.sh 500 times locally and modify the .travis.yml config file to trigger heavy deployment test when pushing code and run the test for dozens of times on Travis. All the tests were passed.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSimilar to JDBC connectors, Hive connectors communicate with Flink framework using TableSchema, which contains DataType. As the time data read from and write to Hive connectors must be `java.sql.*` types and the default conversion class of our time data types are `java.time.*`, we have to fix Hive connector with DataTypes.DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP support.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `DataTypes.DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP` support for hive connectors, and is similar to PR #9236 .\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Fix `DataTypes.DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP` support for hive connectors.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: run the newly added `HiveFullTest`. This new test is to test if the time data can correctly flow from hive source to flink system and finally to hive sink.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be other bugs in hive connectors. When running this tests along with other hive tests in idea, `HiveTableSinkTest` will fail; bug when running this tests along with others in maven the tests will all pass. @zjuwangg please take a look into this issue.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR make SlotPool to fail batch slot requests immediately if they are unfulfillable, which means they cannot be fulfilled by any slot (available or not) in the cluster.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of request slots from RM failures:\r\n1. RM does not have available slots. All slots are in use at the moment. But they might become available later when the currently running tasks finish.\r\n2. The slot request requires too many resources that can not be fulfilled by any slot (available or not) in the cluster. The request is also not likely to be fulfilled later.\r\n\r\nFor the 2nd kinds of failures, it doesn't make sense to wait for the timeout. SlotPool should fail the job immediately, with proper error messages describing the problem and suggesting the user to tune job or cluster configurations.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 6af614c1647429d76c8514a67e7c5439e90a50e1, 8b5e9ff88e6052dc5845a9fcff684261c697899f: Cleanups for existing codes.\r\n- dbdace5ae68331bd1203525425b357639e334752: Remove `SlotManagerException`, replace with its base class `ResourceException`.\r\n- bb2c7c92fdbafe3644ab76041b300a23a6c87744: Introduce `UnfulfillableSlotRequestException` and fail pending batch slot requests on it.\r\n- dfe5ef072dadfc0e1510f1923911304c635e54af: Add test cases for failing unfulfillable batch slot requests.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Add `SlotPoolBatchSlotRequestTest#testPendingBatchSlotRequestFailsIfAllocationFailsUnfulfillable` that validates that pending batch slot requests fail when allocation fail with unfulfillable exception.\r\n- Add `SlotPoolBatchSlotRequestTest#testPendingBatchSlotRequestFailsIfRMRequestFailsUnfulfillable` that validates that pending batch slot requests fail when requesting slots from RM fail with unfulfillable exception. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-02T09:11:14Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T15:59:02Z","closed_at":"2019-08-02T09:53:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/9338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/9338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bf99b26cf9a452ebb14b6ab7b10003ad1c8a4cba","head":{"label":"apache:release-1.9","ref":"release-1.9","sha":"bf99b26cf9a452ebb14b6ab7b10003ad1c8a4cba","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis PR fixes the issue described in [1] that support priority of the Flink YARN application.\r\n\r\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-13548\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  -  provide APPLICATION_PRIORITY config in YarnConfigOptions\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are a lot of TableSink connectors uses `dataStream.addSink()` without `.setParallelism()` explicitly. This will use default parallelism of the environment. However, the parallelism of input transformation might not be `env.parallelism`, for example, global aggregation has 1 parallelism. In this case, it will lead to data reorder, and result in incorrect result.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChecks all the implementation of `StreamTableSink#emitDataStream/consumeDataStream`, and set parallelism as input parallelism. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, we provide a set of configurations in blink planner to support optimization or enable some advanced feature. However, all the configurations can't be set in SQL CLI.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows setting table environment configurations in SQL CLI by using the following methods:\r\n\r\n* Modify config files:\r\n```yaml\r\nconfiguration:\r\n  table.exec.spill-compression.enabled: true\r\n  table.exec.spill-compression.block-size: 128kb\r\n  table.optimizer.join-reorder-enabled: true\r\n```\r\n* Or use `set` command:\r\n```\r\nSET table.exec.spill-compression.enable=true;\r\nSET table.exec.spill-compression.block-size=128kb;\r\nSET table.optimizer.join-reorder-enabled=true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that different from other options in SQL CLI, the `SET` command about table environment configurations does not start with `configuration.` prefix but directly uses the option name.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Allow setting configurations in SQL CLI\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: run the newly added tests `LocalExecutorITCase::testTableEnvConfigurations` and `ExecutionContextTest::testConfigurations`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnable reuse forks for integration tests in blink planner.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nOverride `maven-surefire-plugin` configuration in blink planner pom.xml.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDuring startup of a transactional Kafka producer from previous state, we recover in two steps:\r\n1) in `TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction`, we commit pending commit-transactions and abort pending transactions and then call into `finishRecoveringContext()`\r\n2) in `FlinkKafkaProducer#finishRecoveringContext()` we iterate over all recovered transaction IDs and abort them.\r\n\r\nThis may lead to some transactions being worked on twice and there is quite some overhead from creating a `KafkaProducer` for each of these transactions.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- provide `finishRecoveringContext()` with a collection of all transactions that `TwoPhaseCommitSinkFunction` already covered\r\n- adapt `FlinkKafkaProducer` and `FlinkKafkaProducer011` to ignores transactional IDs from that set\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `FlinkKafkaProducerITCase` and `KafkaProducerExactlyOnceITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The
