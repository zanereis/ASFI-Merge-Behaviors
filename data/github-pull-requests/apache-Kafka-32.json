First, it changes the handling of IncrementalAlterConfigs to check if the controller is ZK vs KRaft and only forward for KRaft. Second, it adds a check in KafkaZkClient#setOrCreateEntityConfigs to ensure a ZK broker is not directly modifying configs in ZK if there is a KRaft controller. This closes the race condition between KRaft taking over as the active controller and the ZK brokers learning about this.\r\n\r\n## Forwarding\r\n\r\nDuring the ZK migration, there is a time when the ZK brokers are running with migrations enabled, but KRaft has yet to take over as the controller.  Prior to KRaft taking over as the controller, the ZK brokers in migration mode were unconditionally forwarding IncrementalAlterConfigs (IAC) to the ZK controller. This works for some config types, but breaks when setting BROKER and BROKER_LOGGER configs for a specific broker. The behavior in KafkaApis for IAC was to always forward if the forwarding manager was defined. Since ZK brokers in migration mode have forwarding enabled, the forwarding would happen, and the special logic for BROKER and BROKER_LOGGER would be missed, causing the request to fail.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, the IAC handler will check if the controller is KRaft or ZK and only forward for KRaft.\r\n\r\n## Protected ZK Writes\r\n\r\nAs part of KIP-500, we moved most (but not all) ZK mutations to the ZK controller. One of the things we did not move fully to the controller was entity configs. This is because there was some special logic that needed to run on the broker for certain config updates. If a broker-specific config was set, AdminClient would route the request to the proper broker. In KRaft, we have a different mechanism for handling broker-specific config updates.\r\n\r\nLeaving this ZK update on the broker side would be okay if we were guarding writes on the controller epoch, but it turns out KafkaZkClient#setOrCreateEntityConfigs does unprotected \"last writer wins\" updates to ZK. This means a ZK broker could update the contents of ZK _after_ the metadata had been migrated to KRaft. No good! To fix this, this patch adds a check on the controller epoch to KafkaZkClient#setOrCreateEntityConfigs but also adds logic to fail the update if the controller is a KRaft controller.\r\n\r\nThe new logic in setOrCreateEntityConfigs adds STALE_CONTROLLER_EPOCH as a new exception that can be thrown while updating configs.","created_at":"2024-04-17T14:49:00Z","updated_at":"2024-05-07T00:29:57Z","closed_at":"2024-05-07T00:29:57Z","merged_at":"2024-05-07T00:29:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"fe8ccbc92c2b1e75f2dddd81066b3dca0065e1cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9d8948609f64bffb09e1d219427da34b8ac54156","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-16539-alter-configs-pre-migration","ref":"KAFKA-16539-alter-configs-pre-migration","sha":"9d8948609f64bffb09e1d219427da34b8ac54156","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

The behaviour regarding static consumers that join with conflicting group instance id is slightly different between the classic and new consumer protocol, so the expectations in the tests needed to be updated.  \r\n\r\nIf static members join with same instance id:\r\n\r\n- Classic protocol: all members join the group with the same group instance id, and then the first one will eventually fail (receives a HB error with FencedInstanceIdException)\r\n\r\n- Consumer protocol: new member with an instance Id already in use is not able to join, and first member remains active (new member with same instance Id receives an UnreleasedInstanceIdException in the response to the HB to join the group)\r\n\r\nThis PR is keeping the single parametrized test that existed before, given that what's being tested and part of the test itself apply to all protocols. This is just updating the expectations that are different, based on the protocol

running ZK migrating to KRaft process, we encountered an issue that the migrating is hanging and the `ZkMigrationState` cannot move to `MIGRATION` state. And it is because the pollEvent didn't retry with the retriable `MigrationClientException` (ZK client retriable errors) while it should. This PR fixes it and add test. And because of this, the poll event will not poll anymore, which causes the KRaftMigrationDriver hanging.\r\n\r\nWe could consider to let the leader node do the znode creation only to avoid this conflict issue. But that will be another improvement.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [

a missubmitted [PR](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15706): For those cases where only Kafka is used to commit and store offsets (generation <= 0), it is only necessary to remove them from the `groupMetadataCache`, without writing a tombstone message for the `groupMetadataKey`, because such groups have never written the `groupMetadataKey`. Therefore, the cleanup of such groups should also log out relevant logs indicating their removal from the `groupMetadataCache`. The current log printing is not friendly for the cleanup of such groups.","created_at":"2024-04-16T03:39:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-05T03:38:41Z","closed_at":"2025-01-05T03:38:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"satishd","id":2577761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd","html_url":"https://github.com/satishd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

some cases, the network layer is _very_ fast and can process a response and send out a follow-up request within the same millisecond timestamp. This is causing problems due to the way we determine if we already have an inflight request.\r\n\r\nThe previous logic for tracking inflight status used timestamps: if the timestamp from the last received response was less than the timestamp from the last sent request, we'd interpret that as having an inflight request. However, this approach would incorrectly return `false` from `RequestState.requestInFlight()` if the two timestamps were _equal_.\r\n\r\nOne result of this faulty logic is that in such cases, the consumer would accidentally send multiple heartbeat requests to the consumer group coordinator. The consumer group coordinator would interpret these requests as 'join group' requests and create members for each request. Therefore, the coordinator was under the false understanding that there were more members in the group than there really were. Consequently, if your luck was _really_ bad, the coordinator might assign partitions to one of the duplicate members. Those partitions would be assigned to a phantom consumer that was not reading any data, and this led to flaky tests.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a stupid simple flag to `RequestState` that is set in `onSendAttempt` and cleared in `onSuccessfulAttempt`, `onFailedAttempt`, and `reset`. A new unit test has been added and this has been tested against all of the consumer unit and integration tests, and has removed all known occurrences of phantom consumer group members in the system tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

of KIP-773](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11302) deprecated `iotime-total`  and `io-waittime-total` metrics. It wasn't expected to mark `io-ratio` and `io-wait-ratio` deprecated. However, now they have `*Deprecated* ` in their description. Here is the reason:\r\n1. register `io-ratio` (desc: `*Deprecated* The fraction of time ...`) -> registered\r\n2. register `iotime-total` (desc: `*Deprecated* The total time ...`) -> registered \r\n3. register `io-ratio` (desc: `The fraction of time ...`) -> **skipped, the same name already exists in registry**\r\n4. register `io-time-ns-total` (desc: `The total time ...`) -> registered \r\n\r\nAs a result, `io-ratio` has incorrect description. The same for `io-wait-ratio`.

the `cleanupGroupMetadata` method, tombstone messages is written to delete the group's MetadataKey only when the group is in the Dead state and the generation is greater than 0. The comment indicates: 'We avoid writing the tombstone when the generationId is 0, since this group is only using Kafka for offset storage.' This means that groups that only use Kafka for offset storage should not be deleted. However, there is a situation where, for example, Flink commit offsets with a generationId equal to -1. If the ApiKeys.DELETE_GROUPS is called to delete this group, Flink's group metadata will never be deleted. Yet, the logic above has already cleaned up commitKey by writing tombstone messages with `removedOffsets`. Therefore, the actual manifestation is: the group no longer exists (since the offsets have been cleaned up, there is no possibility of adding the group back to the `groupMetadataCache` unless offsets are committed again with the same group name), but the corresponding group metadata information still exists in __consumer_offsets. This leads to the problem that deleting the group does not completely clean up its related information.\r\n\r\nThe group's state is set to Dead only in the following three situations:\r\n1. The group information is unloaded\r\n2. The group is deleted by ApiKeys.DELETE_GROUPS\r\n3. All offsets of the group have expired or removed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, since the group is already in the Dead state and has been removed from the `groupMetadataCache`, why not directly clean up all the information of the group? Even if it is only used for storing offsets.","created_at":"2024-04-12T14:16:18Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T03:23:40Z","closed_at":"2024-04-16T03:23:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e27793976e8d2057dd365435526602f05a92ba73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

for resetting HB timer when the request is sent, rather than when a response is received. This ensures a more accurate timing of the HB, so that a member always sends HB on the interval (not in the interval + any delay in receiving the response).  \r\nThis change, along with the logic already in place for checking in-flights, ensures that if the interval expires but there is a HB in-flight, the next HB is only send after the response for the in-flight is received, without waiting for another full interval. This is btw consistent with the timer reset & inflight behaviour for the auto-commit interval.

creating a topic in KRaft cluster, a config value returned by createTopics() is different than what you get from describeConfigs().​*\r\n\r\n*My guess from reading the code is that describeTopics() will send the request to a specified broker if the config resource is broker (ConfigResouce.Type.BROKER). In the case that the config resource is topic (ConfigResouce.Type.TOPIC), then a broker will be assigned using LeastLoadBrokerOrActiveKController() (in KafkaAdminClient), which in this situation will assign the \"least loaded\" broker. I have tested this and, indeed, each time I use describeConfigs() with the ConfigResource's type being \"TOPIC\", a different broker's static configuration may be returned. My question is: Is it supposed to be the way describeConfigs() should be used with the configResource's type being ConfigResouce.Type.TOPIC? Or even, are we supposed to use describeConfig() with configResource's type being ConfigResouce.Type.TOPIC instead of strictly with ConfigResouce.Type.BROKER?\r\n\r\nI have also added some comments in the code for my understanding of the logic of describeConfigs() *\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

javadoc for `KafkaConsumer.commitSync` says:\r\n\r\n> Note that asynchronous offset commits sent previously with the {https://github.com/link #commitAsync(OffsetCommitCallback)}\r\n> (or similar) are guaranteed to have their callbacks invoked prior to completion of this method.\r\n\r\nThis is not always true in the legacy consumer, when the set of offsets is empty, the execution of the commit callback is not always awaited. There are also various races possible that can avoid callback handler execution. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, there is code in the legacy consumer to await the completion of the commit callback before closing, however, the code doesn't cover all cases and the behavior is therefore inconsistent. While the javadoc doesn't explicitly promise callback execution, it promises \"completing commits\", which one would reasonably expect to include callback execution. Either way, the current behavior of the legacy consumer is inconsistent. \r\n\r\nThis change proposed a number of fixes to clean up the callback execution guarantees:\r\n\r\n - We also need to await async commits that are \"pending\" instead of \"in-flight\", because we do not know the coordinator yet.\r\n - In close, we need do not only execute the commit listeners of \"pending\" commits, but also those of \"in-flight\" commits.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

we want to define server properties for all test cases, and using `BeforeEach` to modify the `ClusterConfig` is the only way. The side effect is that the IDE does not like the style since IDE can't recognize custom ParameterResolver of `ClusterConfig`.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is that we can take `ClusterInstance` from constructor first, and then we modify the inner `ClusterConfig` in `BeforeEach` phase. However, that may confuse users about the life cycle of \"configs\".\r\n\r\nIn short, I prefer to define the server property by `ClusterTestDefaults`. It already includes some server-side default property, and we can enhance that to deal with more existent test case.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

support for the KafkaRaftClient to read the control records KRaftVersionRecord and VotersRecord in the snapshot and log. As the control records in the KRaft partition are read, the replica's known set of voters are updated. This change also contains the necessary changes to include the control records when a snapshot is generated by the KRaft state machine.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that this commit changes the code and the in-memory state to track the sets of voters but it doesn't change any data that is externally exposed. It doesn't change the RPCs, data stored on disk or configuration.\r\n\r\nWhen the KRaft replica starts the PartitionListener reads the latest snapshot and then log segments up to the LEO, updating the in-memory state as it reads KRaftVersionRecord and VotersRecord. When the replica (leader and follower) appends to the log, the PartitionListener catches up to the new LEO. When the replica truncates the log because of a diverging epoch, the PartitionListener also truncates the in-memory state to the new LEO. When the state machine generate a new snapshot the PartitionListener trims any prefix entries that are not needed. This is all done to minimize the amount of data tracked in-memory and to make sure that it matches the state on disk.\r\n\r\nTo implement the functionality described above this commit also makes the following changes:\r\n\r\nAdds control records for KRaftVersionRecord and VotersRecord. KRaftVersionRecord describes the finalized kraft.version supported by all of the replicas. VotersRecords describes the set of voters at a specific offset.\r\n\r\nChanges Kafka's feature version to support 0 as the smallest valid value. This is needed because the default value for kraft.version is 0.\r\n\r\nRefactors FileRawSnapshotWriter so that it doesn't directly call the onSnapshotFrozen callback. It adds NotifyingRawSnapshotWriter for calling such callbacks. This reorganization is needed because in this change both the KafkaMetadataLog and the KafkaRaftClient need to react to snapshots getting frozen.\r\n\r\nCleans up KafkaRaftClient's initialization. Removes initialize from RaftClient - this is an implementation detail that doesn't need to be exposed in the interface. Removes RaftConfig.AddressSpec and simplifies the bootstrapping of the static voter's address. The bootstrapping of the address is delayed because of tests. We should be able to simplify this further in future commits.\r\n\r\nUpdate the DumpLogSegment CLI to support the new control records KRaftVersionRecord and VotersRecord.\r\n\r\nFix the RecordsSnapshotReader implementations so that the iterator includes control records. RecordsIterator is extended to support reading the new control records.\r\nImprove the BatchAccumulator implementation to allow multiple control records in one control batch. This is needed so that KRaft can make sure that VotersRecord is included in the same batch as the control record (KRaftVersionRecord) that upgrades the kraft.version to 1.\r\n\r\nAdd a History interface and default implementation TreeMapHistory. This is used to track all of the sets of voters between the latest snapshot and the LEO. This is needed so that KafkaRaftClient can query for the latest set of voters and so that KafkaRaftClient can include the correct set of voters when the state machine generates a new snapshot at a given offset.\r\n\r\nAdd a builder pattern for RecordsSnapshotWriter. The new builder pattern also implements including the KRaftVersionRecord and VotersRecord control records in the snapshot as necessary. A KRaftVersionRecord should be appended if the kraft.version is greater than 0 at the snapshot's offset. Similarly, a VotersRecord should be appended to the snapshot with the latest value up to the snapshot's offset.","created_at":"2024-04-05T20:17:37Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T20:39:03Z","closed_at":"2024-05-04T19:43:16Z","merged_at":"2024-05-04T19:43:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"bfe81d622979809325c31d549943c40f6f0f7337","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6787634831,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABlJMWjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-853","name":"KIP-853","color":"D00CA6","default":false,"description":"KRaft

changes for improving the logging and docs related to the auto-commit inflight logic, also adding tests to ensure the expected behaviour:\r\n\r\n- auto-commit on the interval does not send a request if another one inflight, and it sends the next as soon as a response is received (without waiting for the full interval again)\r\n- auto-commit before revocation always send a request (even if another one from auto-commit on interval is in-flight), to ensure the latest is committed before revoking partitions. \r\n\r\nNo changes in logic, just adding tests, docs and minor refactoring.

on https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15411, the pr contains triggering of group conversion from a classic group to a consumer group.\r\n\r\nIn consumerGroupHeartbeat, the online migration will be triggered if a joining request (the request member epoch is 0) to an non-empty classic group is received. The converting method will create a new consumer group according to the existing classic group. The new consumer group's reference will be used in the following member joining process but will not be persisted to the timeline data structure until the records are replayed.\r\n\r\nA special case to consider is when the replay of the conversion and joining records fail. A possible solution is discussed in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15587.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

the consumer group protocol is used in a cluster, it is, at the moment, impossible to see all records stored in the `__consumer_offsets` topic with `kafka-dump-log --offsets-decoder`. It does not know how to handle all the new records.\r\n\r\nThis patch refactors the `OffsetsMessageParser` used internally by `kafka-dump-log` to use the `RecordSerde` used by the new group coordinator. It ensures that the tool is always in sync with the coordinator implementation. The patch also changes the format to using the toString'ed representations of the records instead of having custom logic to dump them. It ensures that all the information is always dumped. The downside of the latest is that inner byte arrays (e.g. assignment in the classic protocol) are no longer deserialized. Personally, I feel like that it is acceptable and it is actually better to stay as close as possible to the actual records in this tool. It also avoids issues like https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15603.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

patch changes the behavior of the migrating ZK broker to always delete the local metadata log during startup. This deletion is done immediately before creating the RaftManager which will re-create the log directory and let the broker re-replicate the log from the active controller. \r\n\r\nThis new behavior is only present for ZK brokers that having migrations enabled. KRaft brokers, even those with migrations enabled, will not delete their local metadata log. KRaft controllers are not impacted by this change.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for this change is to make it easier for operators to re-attempt a ZK to KRaft migration after having reverted back to ZK mode. If an operator has reverted back to ZK mode, there will be an invalid metadata log on the disk of each broker. In order to re-attempt the migration in the future, this log needs to be deleted. This can be pretty burdensome to the operator for large clusters, especially since the log deletion must be done while the broker is offline.","created_at":"2024-04-02T18:55:36Z","updated_at":"2024-04-12T17:21:30Z","closed_at":"2024-04-12T17:21:30Z","merged_at":"2024-04-12T17:21:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"e02ffd852fae7c1d2681621be7eb888e3805e027","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/acb9add4881e740e426677fe02d8316493728603","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-16463-delete-metadata-log","ref":"KAFKA-16463-delete-metadata-log","sha":"acb9add4881e740e426677fe02d8316493728603","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

Problem\r\nAs stated in the [KAFKA-15615](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/KAFKA/issues/KAFKA-15615) \r\nWhen a fetch response receives an error about partition leadership, fencing, etc. a metadata refresh is triggered.\r\nUntil its metadata is updated, the consumer will continue to attempt fetching data for the partition, resulting in failure responses due to outdated information.\r\n\r\n# Approach\r\nIn cases where a partition requires metadata updates due to Fetch response, a temporary \"Pause\" approach is applied.\r\n- In this situation, the partition transitions to the `AWAIT_UPDATE` (ADD) state.\r\n- The `AWAIT_UPDATE` state is an Unfetchable state (`TopicPartitionState.isFetchable()` is false).\r\n- In other words, the partition is excluded from the Fetch targets in `AbstractFetch.fetchablePartitions`.\r\n- For KIP-951, if the fetch error response includes CurrentLeader information, the subscription remains fetchable as is.\r\n\r\n\r\n`AWAIT_UPDATE`\r\n- Transitions from\r\n  - `FETCHING`\r\n- Transitions to\r\n  - `FETCHING`\r\n  - `AWAIT_RESET`\r\n  - `AWAIT_VALIDATION`\r\n  - `AWAIT_UPDATE`\r\n- Even if the metadata is updated without changes to Leader and Epoch information in the `AWAIT_UPDATE` state, the. partition transitions to the next state by
