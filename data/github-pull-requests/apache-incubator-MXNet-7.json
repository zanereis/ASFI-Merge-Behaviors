The MXNet source code is distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. However\r\nbuilding MXNet for GPUs requires compiling with Nvidia tools and libraries\r\nthat are not compatible with Apache License, Version 2.0. This will affect the usage for\r\nany binary distributions of MXNet for GPU. \r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the fact that GPU functionality is an optional feature in mxnet, we shouldn't have to include this in the disclaimer.","created_at":"2021-05-04T03:25:29Z","updated_at":"2021-05-04T19:40:27Z","closed_at":"2021-05-04T19:40:24Z","merged_at":"2021-05-04T19:40:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d267558dc0ecf401b1d9959c0e436f2648684a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n\r\nHi there,\r\nThis PR fixes the issue #20232 \r\nWhen a operator is not implemented in MXNet, it will be fallbacked to official numpy operator.\r\nHowever, it triggers a bug when the NDArray only exist in `kwargs`.\r\n\r\nReproduce Example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom mxnet import np, npx\r\nnpx.set_np()\r\ndata = np.array([[1,2,3.], [4.,5.,6]])\r\nprint(np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: x.mean(), axis=1, arr=data))\r\n```\r\n \r\nThe reason is that the function `_as_onp_array` in [`multiarray.py#L380`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/numpy/multiarray.py#L380) could not discriminate the NDArray in `kwargs`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] make the function  `_as_onp_array` in [`multiarray.py#L380`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/numpy/multiarray.py#L380) support NDArray in `kwargs`.\r\n- [x] add a related

Description ##\r\nReuse the params in `cached_op_args` for subsequent calls to `optimize_for`. Currently, if a new param is added during one call to `optimize_for` it is not available for subsequent calls. For example, if you run multiple graph passes then you would need to export/import to get the param. This PR checks if `cached_op_args` is set and reuses those, otherwise it just calls `collect_params` like normal. \r\n\r\nAlso added a check for `backend` argument in `optimize_for` and cleaned up logic to call `hybridize` now that we're using a `clear` argument to control clearing the cached_graph (whereas before we werent calling hybridize in order to not clear the cached_graph). \r\n\r\nFYI

Description ##\r\nThis commit fixes 2 problems:\r\n - previously in the calculation of the workspace size of NMS operator the space for the buffer was not included, resulting in potentially too small allocation\r\n - because the type requested for `uint8_t`, the maximum workspace size without setting large tensor support was 2GB, which was too small for some cases, without any error reporting (going over that limit would make the index_t in Shape1 overflow, resulting in negative value, which would later be cast to size_t in the allocator and MXNet would try to allocate a huge amount of memory, resulting in OoM). This PR changes the type of the allocation to double so that the size limit for workspace rises to 16 GB when large tensor support is not enabled. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n-

Description ##\r\nTo fix Windows GPU VS 2019 build, make CPU only EvalRandom functions' GPU version to call their CPU version. When compiling the C++ standard header file random provided by MSVC 14.28.29910 with `__CUDACC__` (nvcc drives), the _Float_upper_bound fails to compile due to _CONSTEXPR_IF is defined to nothing, if _Ty_digits < _Flt_digits.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Fix Windows GPU build with latest VS 2019 \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- I tried building with the ci/build_windows.py script.\r\n- I don't know why CI or others haven't encountered this problem, but with my newly downloaded VS 2019 (MSVC 14.28.29910), it keeps failing.\r\n- My point is as less of CPU code should be compiled with `__CUDACC__` flag as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-23T17:33:00Z","updated_at":"2021-05-03T08:40:30Z","closed_at":"2021-04-30T14:33:22Z","merged_at":"2021-04-30T14:33:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"2aa24535d782a1dda274d5c999c543c55f394c2c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis change adds oneDNN support for two operators:\r\n- _contrib_interleaved_matmul_selfatt_qk\r\n- _contrib_interleaved_matmul_selfatt_valatt\r\n\r\nBoth operators will be used when backend MKLDNN/MKLDNN_QUANTIZE will be chosen - there is no change in terms of performance between MKL fp32 vs. oneDNN fp32, but the main advantage is utilizing int8 data type\r\n\r\n10 iterations of BERT-Large (gluon-nlp v0.10.x) [Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9940X CPU @ 3.30GHz]:\r\n\r\n**MKL implementation (fp32 as int8 is not

Description ##\r\nCurrently, deconvolution 2D is implemented with oneDNN convolution primitives. Deconvolution forward pass is implemented with convolution backward primitives that do not include bias. This requires you to manually add the bias, which is currently broken (#19768). \r\n\r\nThis change implements oneDNN deconvolution primitives to deconvolution, fixing (#19768).\r\nAs I couldn't reproduce (#12579)  for the 2D case, I enabled the 2D part of this test.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL],

which we can later expand on with other prs\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.Graduate the MX2ONNX module (exporting to ONNX format) from the mx.contrib.onnx namespace to a regular and shallower directory (such as mxnet.mx2onnx).\r\n2.Deprecate the ONNX2MX module (importing from ONNX format)\r\n3.Only support ONNX 1.7, 1.8, and future releases for MX2ONNX.\r\n4.Add a setup.py for MX2ONNX.\r\n5.Up to date, accurate, and better documentation.\r\n\r\n```","created_at":"2021-03-25T22:10:46Z","updated_at":"2021-04-02T19:49:17Z","closed_at":"2021-04-02T19:49:17Z","merged_at":"2021-04-02T19:49:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"852f962e3b9072c6bf1dd0fd113067bd9669344b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

PR adds an option to specify the output shapes of a dynamic onnx graph.

This export also ran fine with onnxruntime. So I suspect there might be some incompatibility issue on TRT's side? I was not able to debug the above error message so I thought maybe the Nvidia team might be able to provide some insights? @TristonC @MoisesHer
