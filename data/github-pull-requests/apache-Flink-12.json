What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nState downloading in Flink can be a time and CPU consuming operation, which is especially visible if CPU resources per task slot are strictly restricted to for example a single CPU. Downloading 1GB of state size can take significant amount of time, while the code doing so is quite inefficient.\r\n\r\nCurrently when downloading state files, Flink is creating an FSDataInputStream from the remote file, and copies its bytes, to an OutputStream pointing to a local file (in the RocksDBStateDownloader#downloadDataForStateHandle method). FSDataInputStream internally is being wrapped by many layers of abstractions and indirections and what’s worse, every file is being copied individually, which leads to quite high overheads for small files. Download times and download process CPU efficiency can be significantly improved if we introduced an API to allow org.apache.flink.core.fs.FileSystem to copy many files natively and all at once.\r\n\r\nFor S3, there are at least two potential implementations. The first one is using AWS SDKv2 directly (Flink currently is using AWS SDKv1 wrapped by hadoop/presto) and Amazon S3 Transfer Manager. Second option is to use a 3rd party tool called s5cmd. It is claimed to be a faster alternative to the official AWS clients, which was confirmed by our benchmarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis PR covers two first steps for FLIP-444:\r\n- [Provide native file copy support for S3 using s5cmd](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35767)\r\n- [Use native file copy in RocksDBStateDownloader](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35768)\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is covered by a couple of new ITCases, that run s5cmd against Minio and some unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPrevents early unregistration of `JobManagerRunner` before it's closed successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMoves the `JobManagerRunner` unregistration to another stage in the `CompletableFuture` in `DefaultJobManagerRunnerRegistry.localCleanupAsync()` to keep `JobManagerRunner` from being unregistered before it's closed successfully.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe existing tests have been modified to check the new behaviour.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(Avoid duplicating broadcast records redundantly for hybrid shuffle)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Avoid duplicating broadcast records redundantly for hybrid shuffle*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix that the latency marker metrics aren't updated after failover.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange the latency metric into the TaskMetricsGroup.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nVerified locally.  \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1093\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/64569824/f25cc6b7-822e-46cd-afcb-87e417fc4ec2\">\r\n\r\nbefore the exception:  \r\n<img width=\"1096\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/64569824/1d131bd7-f9a2-40c6-9459-29ec51753ef3\">\r\n\r\n\r\nafter the exception:   \r\n<img width=\"1123\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/64569824/4b0bdad0-5c68-4e69-a64b-c955cc71679d\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA bit reasoning for the change\r\n\r\nThe reason is that since 1.28.0 ( [CALCITE-4787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4787) - Move core to use Immutables instead of ImmutableBeans ) Calcite started to use Immutables (https://immutables.github.io/) and since 1.29.0 removed ImmutableBeans ( [CALCITE-4839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4839) - Remove remnants of ImmutableBeans post 1.28 release ). All rule configuration related api which is not Immutables based is marked as deprecated. Since Immutables implies code generation while java compilation it is seems impossible to use for rules in Scala code.\r\n\r\nThe PR migrates PythonUtil and SplitPythonConditionFromCorrelateRule to java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n1. Add Table Lineage Vertex into transformation in planner. The final LineageGraph is generated from transformation and put into StreamGraph. The lineage graph will be published to Lineage Listener in follow up PR.\r\n2. Deprecated table source and sink are not considered as no enough info can be used for name and namespace for lineage dataset.\r\n3. Resolve the compile error caused by merge conflicts.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - add table lineage interface and default implementations\r\n  - create lineage vertex and add them to transformation in the phase of physical plan to transformation conversion. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n1. Add TableLineageGraphTest for both stream and batch.\r\n2. Added LineageGraph verification in TransformationsTest for legacy sources.\r\n \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-02T13:34:54Z","updated_at":"2024-07-03T13:14:54Z","closed_at":"2024-07-03T13:14:50Z","merged_at":"2024-07-03T13:14:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b0158b4df97a0a0ae44d43f6c7b6947e8ed433f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d1966e73fe6bfb07931b7e1c71223b6ba402c3af","head":{"label":"rkhachatryan:f35472","ref":"f35472","sha":"d1966e73fe6bfb07931b7e1c71223b6ba402c3af","user":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222429887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI0Mjk4ODc=","name":"flink","full_name":"rkhachatryan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35737\r\n\r\nMemoryExecutionGraphInfoStore registers a ShutdownHook upon construction and deregisters it within its close() method.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic MemoryExecutionGraphInfoStore(...) {\r\n    ...\r\n    this.shutdownHook = ShutdownHookUtil.addShutdownHook(this, getClass().getSimpleName(), LOG);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic void close() throws IOException {\r\n    ...\r\n    // Remove shutdown hook to prevent resource leaks\r\n    ShutdownHookUtil.removeShutdownHook(shutdownHook, getClass().getSimpleName(), LOG);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, MiniCluster instantiates a MemoryExecutionGraphInfoStore object but doesn't retain a reference to it, nor does it call close() during its own shutdown process.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        final DispatcherResourceManagerComponent dispatcherResourceManagerComponent =\r\n                dispatcherResourceManagerComponentFactory.create(\r\n                        ...\r\n                        new MemoryExecutionGraphInfoStore(),  // -> new\r\n                        ...); \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior leads to an accumulation of ShutdownHooks when running multiple Flink jobs within the same local JVM. These accumulating hooks, along with their associated references, contribute to a memory leak.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses the issue by ensuring that MemoryExecutionGraphInfoStore's close() method is invoked during MiniCluster shutdown.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-02T03:45:36Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T12:25:01Z","closed_at":"2025-01-07T12:25:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c485881e62494e78334e3a72ac0905eeb2427871","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Samrat002","id":40290566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjkwNTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40290566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002","html_url":"https://github.com/Samrat002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samrat002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25009/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25009/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25009/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9a2ed928920182c7a8353346c0da223f40ea6668","head":{"label":"fengjiajie:dev/1.18/FLINK-35737","ref":"dev/1.18/FLINK-35737","sha":"9a2ed928920182c7a8353346c0da223f40ea6668","user":{"login":"fengjiajie","id":16379560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzc5NTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16379560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/fengjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":698574667,"node_id":"R_kgDOKaNnSw","name":"flink","full_name":"fengjiajie/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fengjiajie","id":16379560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzc5NTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16379560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie","html_url":"https://github.com/fengjiajie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fengjiajie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fengjiajie/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - fix parquet flink-runtime dependency version\r\n  - optimize put null flags logics\r\n  - relocation exclude three flink-runtime class.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as org.apache.flink.formats.parquet.vector.ParquetColumnarRowSplitReaderTest\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nChange org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull to javax.annotation.Nonnull\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull to javax.annotation.Nonnull\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix incorrect parallelism configured detection for Sink V2.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Fix incorrect parallelism configured detection for Sink V2.\r\n  - Set job vertex parallelism in advance when forward group parallelism is decided to ensure CommittableSummary and CommittableWithLineage order.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change can be verified by StreamingJobGraphGeneratorTest#testParallelismConfiguredForSinkV2 and SinkITCase.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-28T23:31:55Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T23:36:14Z","closed_at":"2024-06-28T23:36:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24995/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24995/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24995/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b739e000f1ad7e9ce6f1dcbb3fbd2bfb27016083","head":{"label":"jeyhunkarimov:v4-watermark","ref":"v4-watermark","sha":"b739e000f1ad7e9ce6f1dcbb3fbd2bfb27016083","user":{"login":"jeyhunkarimov","id":5923880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5923880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov","html_url":"https://github.com/jeyhunkarimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":696473165,"node_id":"R_kgDOKYNWTQ","name":"flink","full_name":"jeyhunkarimov/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jeyhunkarimov","id":5923880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjM4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5923880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov","html_url":"https://github.com/jeyhunkarimov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyhunkarimov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jeyhunkarimov/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen using cast, Flink uses `ExtendedSqlRowTypeNameSpec` to derive the row type, and we should change the `StructKind` from `FULLY_QUALIFIED` in Calcite to `PEEK_FIELDS_NO_EXPAND` in Flink.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Return a Row type with PEEK_FIELDS_NO_EXPAND as the target type in CAST*\r\n  - *Add tests to verify this pr.*\r\n\r\n\r\n##

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen `AsyncScalarFunction` is used in a join, the UDF may be part of the join expression.  This is not currently handled since it expects all uses of the UDF to be in a calc.  So, this PR introduces a logical rule which factors out the UDF call to filter on the result of the join in a calc, which can be handled with existing rules.\r\n\r\nNote that there are existing rules which attempt to either push ON conditions down or pull WHERE conditions up in certain circumstances.  Only when you have what's effectively an INNER JOIN can you take a join condition and safely pull it after the join (since you don't want to do that for ON clauses and a LEFT JOIN, for example).\r\n\r\nThis is similar to `SplitPythonConditionFromJoinRule` and therefore the implementation was split out into `SplitRemoteConditionFromJoinRule` which is now shared in both places.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nCall the UDF within join condition and verify that the UDF is not part of the join logical node:\r\n```\r\nSELECT a from MyTable RIGHT JOIN MyTable2 ON a = a2 \"\r\n                        + \"WHERE a = a2 AND func6(a, a2) > 10\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Added AsyncCalcSplitRuleTest.java test which verifies this.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-27T17:01:38Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T15:05:49Z","closed_at":"2024-08-21T15:05:49Z","merged_at":"2024-08-21T15:05:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"9ecf4cf405c3c55f20f08f7a8970eeacc1ba1ab1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/64bc8a45f5be397f21ef29bc60e3b60cbf1a9f7d","head":{"label":"AlanConfluent:async_scalar_fix_joins","ref":"async_scalar_fix_joins","sha":"64bc8a45f5be397f21ef29bc60e3b60cbf1a9f7d","user":{"login":"AlanConfluent","id":57688982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg4OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57688982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":572267320,"node_id":"R_kgDOIhwbOA","name":"flink","full_name":"AlanConfluent/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlanConfluent","id":57688982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg4OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57688982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\nThis pull request supports parquet read nested data such as array<array>, array<map>, array<row>.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  -  add new structure to record every column's repetition level and definition level.\r\n  - add utils to support parse correct structure with repetition level and definition level.\r\n  - make HeapRowVector supports set child fields\r\n  - make HeapMapVector supports set key vector and value vector\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test case to validate the parsing correct nested structure.\r\n  - Manually verified the change by running flink jobs.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no \r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? JavaDocs\r\n  - \r\n### About how to use definition level and repetition level to parse data\r\nAs we know each column of parquet has three type values: \r\n- data\r\n- repetition level\r\n- definition level\r\nOnly repeated fields increment the repetition level, only non-required fields increment the definition level.\r\n#### Repetition Level\r\nLet’s use the following example to explain how repetition level works.\r\nHere is a message type of parquet:\r\n```\r\nmessage nested {\r\n  repeated group leve1 {\r\n    repeated string leve2;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the column value is as below:\r\nData:                        a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j\r\nRepetition leve(R):  0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, (0)\r\nIn general, R = 0 means this is a new row. So a is the first element of the inner array: [[a]]\r\nFor b, the R = 2 means it belongs to level2, so it belongs to the first inner array, so as c : [[a, b, c]]\r\nFor d, the R = 1 means it belongs to level1, which means it belongs to a new inner array: [[a, b, c], [d]]\r\nFor e, f, g, it’s the same as b and c, so when read to g, the row will be [[a, b, c], [d, e, f, g]].\r\nFor h, the R = 0, which means this is the beginning of a new row.\r\nso whole data will be:\r\nR1: [[a, b, c], [d, e, f, g]]\r\nR2: [[h], [i, j]]\r\n\r\n#### Definition Level\r\nDefinition used to judge whether the value is existing or not.\r\nHere is a message type of parquet:\r\n```\r\nmessage ExampleDefinitionLevel {\r\n  optional group a {\r\n    optional group b {\r\n      optional string c;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this message, it contains a column \"a.b.c\" where each node of the column is of optional type. When \"c\" is defined, both \"a\" and \"b\" are guaranteed to be defined. When \"c\" is undefined, we need to indicate from which level it is undefined. The value and meaning is as below:\r\n\r\n| Value | Definition Level |\r\n|---------|---------|\r\n| a:null | 0 |\r\n|a:{b:null} | 1 |\r\n|a:{b:{c:null}} | 2 |\r\n|a:{b:{c:”foo”}} |  3(all defined)|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-27T09:29:40Z","updated_at":"2024-06-30T11:38:47Z","closed_at":"2024-06-30T11:38:46Z","merged_at":"2024-06-30T11:38:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c899b02ab25a34e4d35c73a8fc0299894110aca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3133db9f3c33263da5b9bf86811a9cc9f34dbbe5","head":{"label":"Stephen0421:FLINK-35702","ref":"FLINK-35702","sha":"3133db9f3c33263da5b9bf86811a9cc9f34dbbe5","user":{"login":"Stephen0421","id":60921147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTIxMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60921147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421","html_url":"https://github.com/Stephen0421","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":383855685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM4NTU2ODU=","name":"flink","full_name":"Stephen0421/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Stephen0421","id":60921147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTIxMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60921147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421","html_url":"https://github.com/Stephen0421","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stephen0421/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Stephen0421/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe `flink-kubernetes` artifact shades Jackson classes coming through fabric8, but since Jackson 2.15, Jackson is a [multi-release JAR](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.15#jar-changes), which requires some additional relocations for correct shading.\r\n\r\nWhat Jackson does itself can be checked [here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/80e6c424ef876f31f07d3ce12c68ecd5294fe004/pom.xml#L192).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Added exclusions for Jackson related meta files, which otherwise overwrites the Flink ones.\r\n- Added relocations for JDK-specific code.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\nTo verify, I pasted a comparison of the content of the JAR before and after the change below.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>\r\n    JAR content before change:\r\n

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe `flink-kubernetes` artifact shades Jackson classes coming through fabric8, but since Jackson 2.15, Jackson is a [multi-release JAR](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.15#jar-changes), which requires some additional relocations for correct shading.\r\n\r\nWhat Jackson does itself can be checked [here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/80e6c424ef876f31f07d3ce12c68ecd5294fe004/pom.xml#L192).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Added exclusions for Jackson related meta files, which otherwise overwrites the Flink ones.\r\n- Added relocations for JDK-specific code.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\nTo verify, I pasted a comparison of the content of the JAR before and after the change below.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>\r\n    JAR content before change:\r\n

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUse ForkJoinPool when enumerating files to greatly increase speed. Especially in cases when majority of time is wasted waiting for remote storage to respond.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- `ForkJoinPool` with `parallelStream` is used in `org.apache.flink.connector.file.src.enumerate.NonSplittingRecursiveEnumerator`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as \r\n- `org.apache.flink.connector.file.src.enumerate.NonSplittingRecursiveEnumerator`\r\n- `org.apache.flink.connector.file.src.enumerate.NonSplittingRecursiveAllDirEnumeratorTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: not

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe `flink-kubernetes` artifact shades Jackson classes coming through fabric8, but since Jackson 2.15, Jackson is a [multi-release JAR](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.15#jar-changes), which requires some additional relocations for correct shading.\r\n\r\nWhat Jackson does itself can be checked [here](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/80e6c424ef876f31f07d3ce12c68ecd5294fe004/pom.xml#L192).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Added exclusions for Jackson related meta files, which otherwise overwrites the Flink ones.\r\n- Added relocations for JDK-specific code.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\nTo verify, I pasted a comparison of the content of the JAR before and after the change below.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>\r\n    JAR content before change:\r\n

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn `ParquetVectorizedInputFormat.java` the row group filter is set\r\n```\r\nFilterCompat.Filter filter = getFilter(hadoopConfig.conf());\r\nParquetReadOptions parquetReadOptions =\r\n        ParquetReadOptions.builder()\r\n                .withRange(splitOffset, splitOffset + splitLength)\r\n                .withRecordFilter(filter)\r\n                .build();\r\n```\r\nBut the row groups are read incorrectly using `readNextRowGroup` instead of `readNextFilteredRowGroup`. This affects the performance (filters are not working because all row groups are read) and also could lead to incorrect result because eventually returning here (totalRowCount are calculated with filters applied):\r\n```\r\nif (rowsReturned >= totalRowCount) {\r\n        return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Changed `readNextRowGroup` to `readNextFilteredRowGroup` in `ParquetColumnarRowSplitReader::readNextRowGroup`*\r\n  - *Changed `readNextRowGroup` to `readNextFilteredRowGroup` in `ParquetVectorizedInputFormat::readNextRowGroup`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / **don't know**)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Fix the issue of registering and unregistering a job for shuffle master*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Fix the issue of registering and unregistering a job for shuffle mastert*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1. Add the missing [output](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/functions/windowing/ProcessWindowFunction.java#L92) method in `ProcessWindowFunction#Context` interface in the doc.\r\n2. Fix typo in Chinese doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Add the missing [output](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/functions/windowing/ProcessWindowFunction.java#L92) method in `ProcessWindowFunction#Context` interface in the doc.\r\n2. Fix typo in Chinese doc.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-21T07:02:50Z","updated_at":"2024-06-26T01:56:36Z","closed_at":"2024-06-26T01:56:36Z","merged_at":"2024-06-26T01:56:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf0ba268e13b20ac1423c326ae780d0f131abd03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24969/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24969/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/58b57ad44d550a795b72728b1350e359ffabbc27","head":{"label":"showuon:ContextInterface","ref":"ContextInterface","sha":"58b57ad44d550a795b72728b1350e359ffabbc27","user":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":806848988,"node_id":"R_kgDOMBeJ3A","name":"flink","full_name":"showuon/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/showuon/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*When running the large-scale job, the job may hang due to the memory decoupling, so we decide to revert it temporarily.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Revert the change of the memory and job topology decoupling.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-21T06:26:42Z","updated_at":"2024-06-24T07:42:22Z","closed_at":"2024-06-24T07:42:03Z","merged_at":"2024-06-24T07:42:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"67d23fc45be45c02341a9cbd7dddea18ba40bca2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24968/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24968/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24968/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/93b25137e0b3a4492ac9793518ef29e9916b1eaf","head":{"label":"TanYuxin-tyx:FLINK-35587","ref":"FLINK-35587","sha":"93b25137e0b3a4492ac9793518ef29e9916b1eaf","user":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":383718803,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM3MTg4MDM=","name":"flink","full_name":"TanYuxin-tyx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdds implementation of `json_quote` and `json_unquote` functions.\r\nPR is a continuation of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24156 and addresses feedback received on the original PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log / changes compared to PR 24156\r\n#### Diff compared to https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24156 - [link](https://github.com/anupamaggarwal/flink/compare/jeyhun-34111..34111-jsonquote_unquote)\r\n\r\n- Change implementation for `json_quote`, now with escaping logic\r\n- Change implementation for `json_unquote` to unescape special characters\r\n- Delegates valid json checking to SqlJsonUtils#isJsonValue\r\n- Add/ update some additional tests\r\n- Updates documentation to remove reference to MySql utf8mb4 encoding\r\n\r\n\r\n## Open questions\r\n- High level behavior for invalid json in json_unquote (pass original input as is, Vs throwing exception) \r\n- To check for JSON_VALIDITY for `json_unquote` logic for `IS JSON` is used but in certain cases `IS JSON` behaviour does not seem to be consistent with Json spec as documented here https://www.json.org/json-en.html \r\n  - According to json spec `\"\"\"\"` should not be a valid json (which is also flagged by JsonLint) but `select '\"\"\"\"' IS JSON` returns true \r\n       -  In case of invalid json string for json_unquote an exception is thrown in case of Mysql (However we won't do the same) \r\n\r\n\r\n### References\r\n- postgres implementation for [escape](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/524d64ea8e3e49b4fda41ff9b2f048b697384058/src/backend/utils/adt/json.c#L2458) \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added ITs in

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[hotfix][streaming] Move the TestProcessingTimeService.java down to the corresponding test package.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[hotfix][streaming] Move the TestProcessingTimeService.java down to the corresponding test package.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-20T11:22:38Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T01:57:37Z","closed_at":"2024-06-27T01:57:37Z","merged_at":"2024-06-27T01:57:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"44497d96054f7fda0eaafcc9907a1e86f4622d56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24965/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24965/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24965/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/52021016bfdf2f7d63e867c3f085fc7d08158cb5","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:hotfix_0620","ref":"hotfix_0620","sha":"52021016bfdf2f7d63e867c3f085fc7d08158cb5","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFlink UI always shows float metric value as int/long. For example, `outPoolUsage`/`inPoolUsage` are always 0 or 1 at UI. That's not helpful when troubleshooting from UI. \r\n\r\nAfter investigation, I found it's because we always parse the metric value via `parseInt` method. We should use `parseFloat` for it. The `parseFloat` can achieve what we expect because when the provided string is a integer, it'll also parsed as an integer, not float. Like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/43372967/4e36783f-9afe-438f-9ab2-03e4e76f12e4)\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the UI is displayed like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/43372967/c8c8ab18-ee31-4b03-9d58-8c6ad2152860)\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the UI can display float value like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/43372967/cf6cc91a-28ed-4fba-ae3e-5ad509b7d5e9)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nReplacing `parseInt` with `parseFloat` to parse metric value.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn \"try flink\" page, there is a [fraud detection with the dataStream API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/try-flink/datastream/#breaking-down-the-code) example to demo how to build a stateful streaming application with Flink’s DataStream API. In this page, we explained the code line by line, but missed the last line:\r\n\r\n`env.execute(\"Fraud Detection\");`\r\n\r\nI confirmed this was existed before [v1.12](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.12/docs/try-flink/datastream_api.md?plain=1#L365), but when we migrated Flink docs from Jekyll to Hugo in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/14903), we missed that section. This miss will let first flink users miss the important line to execute the flink job.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdded back the missing \"env.execute\" explanation in fraud detection example, referring to the original version in v1.12 [here](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.12/docs/try-flink/datastream_api.md?plain=1#L365).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-20T02:54:50Z","updated_at":"2024-07-19T03:23:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a57e63ec9a3f4405eaf932cdf6dba9f936b923d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24959/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24959/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24959/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d756900767d31a941cb257fa84eddd59e1479c0b","head":{"label":"showuon:FLINK-35653","ref":"FLINK-35653","sha":"d756900767d31a941cb257fa84eddd59e1479c0b","user":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":806848988,"node_id":"R_kgDOMBeJ3A","name":"flink","full_name":"showuon/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/showuon/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this change is to fix 2 scenarios where Flink produces incorrect Parquet files.\r\n\r\nScenario 1: Convert nullable Flink types to optional Parquet types. Right now, Flink configures all Parquet types as optional, regardless of whether they are nullable or not.\r\nScenario 2:.Ensures that the converter does not create invalid Parquet files with optional map keys. According to [Parquet standard](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#maps), map keys are required.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Configure non-nullable Flink types as required Parquet types.\r\n- Ensure that Flink map key type is non-nullable / required.\r\n- Ensure that Flink multiset element type is non-nullable / required.\r\n- Adjust existing tests and add new ones to cover the change in behavior.\r\n- Mention the nullable key limitation in Parquet format docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. Adjusted existing tests.\r\n2. Added new test cases to cover invalid types.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: yes?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix documentation error.\r\n1. We required Maven version 3.8.6.\r\n2. `DataStream operators` in [First step](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/try-flink/local_installation/) page is linking to an empty page. Fix it by directing users to `DataStream operators overview` page.\r\n3. Add missing \"Submitting a Flink job\" section in Chinese version doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. We required Maven version 3.8.6, not 3.\r\n2. `DataStream operators` in [First step](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/try-flink/local_installation/) page is linking to an empty page. Fix it by directing users to `DataStream operators overview` page.\r\n3. Add missing \"Submitting a Flink job\" section in Chinese version doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nDoc change only.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-18T11:50:17Z","updated_at":"2024-08-13T09:33:51Z","closed_at":"2024-08-13T09:24:46Z","merged_at":"2024-08-13T09:24:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"be6b313c4704ed70ee6c585e1ddb34ff8777cb17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0eba1c64bf849bcdc1614f665cb206ff2e7a7a7c","head":{"label":"showuon:docMvnVer","ref":"docMvnVer","sha":"0eba1c64bf849bcdc1614f665cb206ff2e7a7a7c","user":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":806848988,"node_id":"R_kgDOMBeJ3A","name":"flink","full_name":"showuon/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/showuon/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMerge the functionality of \"flink run\" and \"flink run-application\" under the \"run\" command to make job deployment more consistent. Also deprecate \"run-application\" so it can be removed together with \"yarn-per-job\" in the future.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduced `isApplication(...)` check method in `FrontendCli` to determine necessary deployment steps.\r\n- Handle application mode deployment in `FrontendCli#run`.\r\n- In `FrontendCli#runApplication`, simply call `FrontendCli#run` after argument check.\r\n- Added unit tests to cover the introduced code flow changes in `CliFrontendRunTests`.\r\n- Updated, adapted CLI help/usage messages, and relevant config option documentation.\r\n- Marked `run-application` deprecated in code, config docs, and help/usage messages. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to cover the introduced changes.\r\n\r\nAlso did a manual check, where I executed the following on a locally built Flink and `minikube` setup:\r\n```sh\r\n$ ./bin/flink run-application \\\r\n    --target kubernetes-application \\\r\n

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nFlink SQL group-agg.md  \"GROUPING SET\" is missing an S\r\nIncorrect syntax near the keyword 'GROUPING'\r\n![2c3c0991043ab1446934743af7c50d5](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/102840730/e7675c99-9ef7-4cc1-a6e6-61e5c95959f7)\r\n![7563d71532e424104849c2e9c87b402](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/102840730/2510aa6e-ba91-4295-b9b7-a4498acd9f8c)\r\n![8c842dee793c612f94f1d7affd4ae84](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/102840730/4a3150c2-016f-4933-915a-568f03eb0cc9)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nChange the package location for test cases files of SlotSelectionStrategy\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange the package location for test cases files of SlotSelectionStrategy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSources with watermark alignment get stuck once some subtasks finish, this PR solves this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nwhile some subtasks have been finished, the SourceOperator send Long.MAX_VALUE to SourceCoordinator, and SourceCoordinator checks whether subtasks have been finished before sending the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.SourceOperatorAlignmentTest::testWatermarkAlignmentWhileSubtaskFinished()*\r\n  -

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, the lastRecordTime variable, which tracks the time of the last received data element, is updated only when the WatermarkStatus transitions from IDLE to ACTIVE. However, it is not updated when WatermarkStatus is ACTIVE, which means even under continuous data flow, the condition `(currentTime - lastRecordTime > idleTimeout)` will eventually always become true, and the WatermarkStatus will erroneously be marked IDLE.\r\n\r\nI believe this bug technically causes incorrect outputs since downstream watermarks advance earlier than they otherwise would. The incorrect state doesn't last forever, though, since when the WatermarkStatus is in in the IDLE state, the next processElement will cause a WatermarkStatus.ACTIVE to be emitted. \r\n\r\nThe new unit test illustrates the flip-flop behavior before the fix:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.flink.table.runtime.operators.wmassigners.WatermarkAssignerOperatorTest.testIdleStateAvoidanceWithConsistentDataFlow -- Time elapsed: 0.013 s <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError:\r\n\r\nExpecting\r\n  [WatermarkStatus(IDLE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(ACTIVE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(IDLE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(ACTIVE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(IDLE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(ACTIVE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(IDLE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(ACTIVE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(IDLE)]\r\nnot to contain\r\n  [WatermarkStatus(IDLE)]\r\nbut found\r\n  [WatermarkStatus(IDLE)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Update lastRecordTime in table WatermarkAssignerOperator on each record to prevent the stream from incorrectly being marked idle\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test that validates the WatermarkStatus is not set to idle when records are sent more frequently than the idleTimeout\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change marks `description` field in `AvroEncoding` `transient` so that `AvroEncoding` that is set in `AvroRowDataSerializationSchema` and `AvroRowDataDeSerializationSchema` can be serializable. As part of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23395, `AvroEncoding` was introduced which uses the `DescriptionElement` which is not `Serializable`. Due to which this fails when `AvroRowDataSerializationSchema` and `AvroRowDataDeSerializationSchema` gets serialized.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added unit test to test the serialization and deserialization of `AvroEncoding` enum.\r\n- Also tested it with `KafkaTableITCase` in flink-kafka-connector locally.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnsure that running `mvn clean verify` works for flink-clients (as is the recommended step from [contributing to flink](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/contribute-code/#3-open-a-pull-request)).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Unit test fix: not to depend on the artefact currently being built*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *running `mvn clean package -pl :flink-clients`*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system
