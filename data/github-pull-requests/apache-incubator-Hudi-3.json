Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn table version 8, we do not populate file slice in delta write stats unless CDC reader is enabled. This was done to accommodate for the new file slicing - https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/0d8554f95a81e3a30c005b97c17dc86afce49ce7#diff-d0cfcc0bcf0edb12a0af4b4bbe63684b24f4ef885f794cd89c594e86f8ff9a33R172\r\n\r\nAs per my understanding, for CDC reader, just setting the base instant time correctly should be sufficient. So, in this patch, we just make the setting of previous base instant time conditional on cdc reader, while yet populate the file slice in the write stat.\r\n \r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdd file slice in delta write stats. This can save filesystem view call when building secondary index.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- As of now, we lookup in col stats for all filter expressions. This patch checks for any non indexed cols and avoids col stats based pruning. The files from pruned files are used as candidate files if any non indexed cols are detected. If not, pruning happens based on col stats index in MDT and candidate files are deduced.  We have also optimized the AND clause. If we have a `leftExpr AND rightExpr`, where leftExpr has non indexed cols, while rightExpr has all indexed cols, we can still afford to prune files based on col stats index. The expression to look up in col stats will omit leftExpr accordingly. Only if both leftExpr and rightExpr has non indexex cols, we can avoid looking up in col stats index. Incase of 'Or' clause, we can't do much, but have to resort to bypass col stats lookup completely. \r\n\r\nlets walk through an example to understand this in detail\r\n\r\nc1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200 \r\n\r\nSay this is the filter expression in the query issued. \r\n\r\ncase 1:\r\nwhen all 3 cols are indexed w/ col stats:\r\n expected col stats lookup expression is \r\n```\r\n(((('c1_minValue <= 619sdc) AND ('c1_maxValue >= 619sdc)) OR (('c2_minValue <= 100) AND ('c2_maxValue >= 100))) AND (('c3_minValue <= 200) AND ('c3_maxValue >= 200)))\r\n```\r\ni.e. all 3 cols will be looked up. \r\n\r\ncase 2: \r\nonly c1 and c2 are indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nsince left of AND exp is indexed, we can ignore c3 which is not indexed (rigth expr of AND). \r\nwe translate to \r\n```\r\n((('c1_minValue <= 619sdc) AND ('c1_maxValue >= 619sdc)) OR (('c2_minValue <= 100) AND ('c2_maxValue >= 100)))\r\n```\r\nand lookup in col stats translated df. \r\n\r\n\r\ncase 3:\r\nonly c1 and c3 are indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nAmong c1 and c2, c2 is not indexed. So, left Expr of (c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100) is deemed as not indexed. But the right expr of 'c3 = 200' is indexed. and so, we translate this to \r\n```\r\n(('c3_minValue <= 200) AND ('c3_maxValue >= 200))\r\n```\r\nand lookup in col stats translated df. \r\n\r\ncase 4: \r\nonly c2 and c3 are indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSame as case 3\r\nSo, we translate it to \r\n```\r\n(('c3_minValue <= 200) AND ('c3_maxValue >= 200))\r\n```\r\nand lookup in col stats translated df. \r\n\r\ncase 5:\r\nonly c2 is indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSince either of Or clause is not indexed, we have to bypass looking up in col stats. \r\n\r\ncase 6:\r\nonly c3 is indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSince either of Or clause is not indexed, we have to bypass looking up in col stats. \r\n\r\ncase 7:\r\nonly c1 is indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSince either of Or clause is not indexed, we have to bypass looking up in col stats. \r\n\r\ncase 8:\r\nonly c2 is indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSince either of Or clause is not indexed, we have to bypass looking up in col stats. \r\n\r\nWhenever we deem as col stats should not be looked up, we return the files w/o pruning from the col stats lookup step. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOptimized lookup in col stats. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCatch KafkaException instances and handle configuration-related errors by wrapping them in a HoodieSourceConfigException. Specifically, handle exceptions such as missing host or port, invalid or unresolved broker addresses, invalid host URLs.\r\n\r\nAlso in some cases missing required configs. For example when io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroDeserializer(default deserializer) is used as kafka deserializer and schema.registry.url config is missing in the provided configs, KafkaConsumer throws io.confluent.common.config.ConfigException during initialization. We're catching those exceptions and categorising them as HoodieSourceConfigExceptions here.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdd new exception type for HoodieSourceConfigException to catch issues specific to kafka configs\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen there are multiple log files generated in the same file group in a inflight deltacommit, rollback of such a deltacommit can fail, because (1) the rollback plan contains multiple rollback requests targeting the log files to roll back in the same file group (2) concurrent execution of these rollback requests in Spark executors cause creation of new rollback log files (appending rollback blocks) in parallel, which involves determining the new log version concurrently, leading to the same new log version to be used in multiple executors, causing marker creation to fail (i.e., multiple executors try to create the marker on the same file name, and subsequent marker creation requests fail due to the fact that marker already exists).\r\n\r\nNote that this problem only happens for table version 6 and below, and backwards compatible writer in Hudi 1.0 writing table version 6.  Hudi 1.x does not append rollback blocks any more because of the new format spec.\r\n\r\nThis issue can be reproduced by the new test added `TestMarkerBasedRollbackStrategy#testRollbackMultipleLogFilesInOneFileGroupInMOR` before applying the fix (need to change line `assertEquals(1, rollbackRequests.size());` to `assertEquals(199, rollbackRequests.size());`):\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 3 in stage 1.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 3.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 103) (192.168.1.16 executor driver): org.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieIOException: [timeline-server-based] Failed to create marker for partition partA, fileName .a1e58d70-ce17-400f-9bfe-f394546f71e2_003.log.201_1-0-1 with IOType APPEND\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.table.marker.TimelineServerBasedWriteMarkers.create(TimelineServerBasedWriteMarkers.java:159)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.table.marker.WriteMarkers.createIfNotExists(WriteMarkers.java:135)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.table.action.rollback.BaseRollbackHelper$1.createAppendMarker(BaseRollbackHelper.java:250)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.table.action.rollback.BaseRollbackHelper$1.preLogFileCreate(BaseRollbackHelper.java:246)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.table.log.HoodieLogFormatWriter.createNewFile(HoodieLogFormatWriter.java:241)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.table.log.HoodieLogFormatWriter.getOutputStream(HoodieLogFormatWriter.java:128)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.table.log.HoodieLogFormatWriter.appendBlocks(HoodieLogFormatWriter.java:152)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.common.table.log.HoodieLogFormatWriter.appendBlock(HoodieLogFormatWriter.java:143)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.table.action.rollback.BaseRollbackHelper.lambda$maybeDeleteAndCollectStats$b2977713$1(BaseRollbackHelper.java:180)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.client.common.HoodieSparkEngineContext.lambda$flatMap$7d470b86$1(HoodieSparkEngineContext.java:150)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR makes two fixes to tackle the problem for table version 6 only:\r\n(1) For rollback plan generation, group the log files to roll back based on the file group (partition + file group ID) so that the log files in the same file group only appears in the same rollback request in the rollback plan (see `MarkerBasedRollbackStrategy#getRollbackRequests`). Note that we only fix marker-based rollback as that's the only supported rollback mode going forward;\r\n(2) There can still be a case that the existing rollback plan generated on the timeline contains multiple rollback requests targeting the log files in the same file group.  To avoid marker creation failure from concurrent execution on these original rollback requests, the rollback execution first groups the rollback requests based on the file group (partition + file group ID) in the rollback plan before parallelization (see `BaseRollbackHelper#maybeDeleteAndCollectStats`).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new tests to comprehensively cover the rollback logic (see `TestBaseRollbackHelper`, `TestMarkerBasedRollbackStrategy`, `TestRollbackUtils`, `TestMarkerBasedRollbackStrategy`).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes rollback failures due to concurrent execution of appending rollback blocks in the same file group.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- As of now, we lookup in col stats for all filter expressions. This patch checks for any non indexed cols and avoids col stats based pruning. The files from pruned files are used as candidate files if any non indexed cols are detected. If not, pruning happens based on col stats index in MDT and candidate files are deduced.  We have also optimized the AND clause. If we have a `leftExpr AND rightExpr`, where leftExpr has non indexed cols, while rightExpr has all indexed cols, we can still afford to prune files based on col stats index. Only if both leftExpr and rightExpr has non indexex cols, we can avoid looking up in col stats index. \r\n\r\nThis is stacked on top of https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12529 \r\nTo review: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12567/files/67a6646b9138fd8707afb338a8ca7a906e040fb7..383e1c7a9a5a9db6944574628b85cce8bf9a4a67 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- No additional overhead to look up in col stats for filters on non indexed col stats. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

**Change Logs and Description Update**\r\n\r\n#### **Overview**\r\nThis proposal introduces a feature allowing clients to designate specific tables as critical. If any critical table fails during a write operation, the sync job will terminate immediately. The implementation is highly configurable, offering both strict and lenient failure handling policies to accommodate diverse use cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Proposed Configurations**\r\n\r\n1. **Critical Table Flag** (Table-level Configuration):  \r\n   - **Description**: Marks specific tables as critical.  \r\n   - **Behavior**: The job fails immediately if any critical table encounters a failure.  \r\n   - **Default**: `false` (tables are non-critical by default).  \r\n\r\n2. **Failed Table Limit** (Global Configuration for Multi-Streamer Job):  \r\n   - **Description**: Sets a threshold for the number of table failures allowed before the job fails.  \r\n   - **Default**: `0` (fail on any table failure unless overridden).  \r\n\r\n3. **Failed Table Handling Enabled** (Global Configuration for Multi-Streamer Job):  \r\n   - **Description**: Toggles enforcement of the failed table limit.  \r\n   - **Default**: `false` (disabled by default).  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Configuration Scenarios**\r\n#### **Global Failure Threshold**\r\n- The job fails if the total number of failed tables exceeds the configured limit.  \r\n- **Example Configuration**:  \r\n  ```properties\r\n  hoodie.streamer.failed_table_limit_enabled=true\r\n  hoodie.streamer.failed_table_limit=2\r\n  ```\r\n#### **Table-Specific Failure Rule**\r\n- Specific tables can be marked as critical:  \r\n  ```properties\r\n  hoodie.streamer.table.t2.criticalTable=true\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### **Impact**\r\nNone for current jobs, clients given option to add configs in future releases. \r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Risk Level**\r\n **Low**:  \r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Documentation Updates**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Contributor's Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [X] Read the contributor's guide.  \r\n- [ ] Clearly state Change Logs and Impact.  \r\n- [ ] Add adequate tests to validate failure configurations.  \r\n- [X] CI passed for implemented changes.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf expression index is created using col stats, the stats based on derived value from expression should be tracked at partition level too.\r\n\r\nThe PR ensures that the partition stat records are stored within the EI partition. The partition stat records are generated during bootstrap of EI as well as during update in the PR. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nPartition level pruning can be achieved using expression index\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nExpression Index can now perform partition pruning for valid queries\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently for Flink stream write, we convert Flink RowData to HoodieRecord first, and then HoodieRecord is serialized and deserialized using Kryo. This SerDe costs are high, which leads to slower `DataStream` processing:\r\n\r\n![1 - Kryo ser](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3977fee7-c663-45c5-a0cd-a3dbb7aa945a)\r\n![2 - Kryo de](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e9b957b-8f27-4c4e-9dcb-38cd7af01549)\r\n\r\nUsing Flink's internal serialization instead of Kryo could decrease processing time of each record in stream significantly. For instance, if we try to switch to `Tuple2<Tuple2<BinaryStringData, BinaryStringData>, RowData>`, where first 2 strings are key and partition path, then SerDe costs are decreased significantly:\r\n\r\n![3 - tuple ser](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5047b883-16c9-4a6f-b8ba-7862c2947448)\r\n![4 - tuple

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no exception when we try to write data in Flink append mode using bucket index. Data will be written, but in parquet files without bucket IDs. And it would happen silently. This MR propose to throw exception in this case, instead of silent write of unexpected for user data.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSimple bucket index is not supported in Flink append mode. Therefore we need to prevent silent unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow. Corresponding test is added.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nThere is no detailed description in the documentation about how different index types are working in different modes of different engines.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-26T13:55:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T06:04:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cde4d60bf9071b534b0615795da9fc325f301a89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zhangyue19921010","id":69956021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTU2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69956021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyue19921010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyue19921010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615585053,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilHRHQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:S","name":"size:S","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"PR

our actual production, we encountered an exception because the log file was not closed and then subsequent tasks to read the file.\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario: A speculative task has finished writing all the data, but the original task has been successfully executed, resulting in the need to kill the task. In the exit logic, we find that the code will remove the shutdown hook and then execute the close. If a jvm exits between the shutdown removal and the close completion, the log file will not be closed properly, resulting in a downstream read error.\r\n\r\norg.apache.hudi.common.table.log.HoodieLogFormatWriter#close\r\n<img width=\"553\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea0b1ab9-d72b-4918-b453-a0aa75f16bc3\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\n1. make sure log file has been closed and then remove the shutdown hook\r\n\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, `hoodie.populate.meta.fields` is not supported in Flink. This config should be used for append mode, so this MR adds support for this case.\r\n\r\n**Before**, master, 3cb874fd53390b4465a8a8b9acd615b1b7f362cf:\r\n![1-append-master-3cb874fd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b609dcc4-8c4c-474d-a16a-3026f4703ecf)\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n![2-append-populate-false](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5b5d037-c13b-461e-b72e-fc1066ef0cf2)\r\n\r\n\r\n|  | Before | After |\r\n| -- | -- | -- |\r\n| CPU samples | 79.8K | 67.9K |\r\n| Total time of 60M rows writing | 108 s | 93 s |\r\n\r\nTPC-H lineitem table is used for profiling.\r\n\r\n14% faster write in append mode for Flink when `hoodie.populate.meta.fields = false`.\r\n\r\nThe next possible optimization for this scenario is to think about do we really need Bloom filters in this use case, because it costs 16% of CPU after optimization of this MR:\r\n![3-append-bloom-filters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a59cd92-1f87-41fd-8747-fa47b4f191d3)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo need. There is no mention in \"All Configurations\" page that `hoodie.populate.meta.fields` is not supported for Flink.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

when performing the read phase of clustering, I find that the memory usage in exeutor can exceed the limit.\r\nFor example: \r\nIf we set `hoodie.clustering.group.read.parallelism = 1` and if we have 10 file-slices in one clustering group.\r\n<img width=\"1272\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80560bbd-11b9-4a7d-92bd-3204b0afa57b\" />\r\nSo we need to initialize these reader one by one, and we need to close the previous reader in time to avoid exceeding memory usage limits and optimize gc process.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n1. optimize executor memory usage

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn Hudi, when scheduling Compaction and Clustering, the default behavior is to scan all partitions under the current table. When there are many historical partitions, such as 640,000 in our production environment, this scanning and planning operation becomes very inefficient. For Flink, it often leads to checkpoint timeouts, resulting in data delays.\r\nAs for cleaning, we already have the ability to do cleaning for incremental partitions.\r\n\r\nThis RFC will draw on the design of Incremental Clean to generalize the capability of processing incremental partitions to all table services, such as Clustering and Compaction.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn Hudi, when scheduling Compaction and Clustering, the default behavior is to scan all partitions under the current table. When there are many historical partitions, such as 640,000 in our production environment, this scanning and planning operation becomes very inefficient. For Flink, it often leads to checkpoint timeouts, resulting in data delays.\r\nAs for cleaning, we already have the ability to do cleaning for incremental partitions.\r\n\r\nThis RFC will draw on the design of Incremental Clean to generalize the capability of processing incremental partitions to all table services, such as Clustering and Compaction.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nClean, Compaction and clustering\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Enabling partition stats by default on the writer for SPARK engine. \r\n- Added support for timestamp, Date, LocalDate, Decimal. \r\n\r\nFew features/tests where PSI is disabled:\r\n- Bootstrap feature is not yet supported. We need to fix it for whole of metadata table. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8774\r\n- Schema evolution w/ partition stats is not yet tackled in this patch. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8587\r\n- Some tests w/ test table infra does not support. Bcoz, whole premise w/ test table infra is to just mock the functionality w/ empty files. And so both col stats and partition stats are not supported. \r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8774 (more complex data types) \r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8814 Enabling col stats and partition stats by default in flink and java. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Enables partition stats by default on writer (SPARK Engine)\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-18T01:57:45Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T01:25:02Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Expression Index\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Fix Incorrect classification of input paths in `InputPathHandler` and `HoodieInputFormatUtils`\r\n- `HoodieInputFormatUtils.groupSnapshotPathsByMetaClient()` was not strict enough and allowed multiple ownership of paths. `forEach()` usage could potentially make multiple `metaClient` associations for a single path.\r\n- Remove not used `HoodieInputFormatUtils.groupFileStatusForSnapshotPaths()` since the logic that called this method were refactored in [HUDI-3094](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4417) and this responsibility moved to `InputPathHandler`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nReduce ambiguity of input paths classification  \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Added a table config (\"hoodie.table.col.stats.indexed.columns\") to track the list of columns indexed with column stats partition in Metadata table. This will be later leveraged during pruning to only lookup in col stats partition for indexed cols (HUDI-8663)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis will help track the actual list of columns indexed with col stats partition in MDT. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bootstrap support with file group reader in compaction and clustering in Spark.  While the file group reader already supports reading bootstrap table fully, the wiring in compaction and clustering had issues before this PR:\r\n(1) The file size is unknown based on the compaction or clustering plan.  When calling file group reader, the file size is not properly populated to the reader, causing no rows to be read in the case of bootstrapped file groups.\r\n(2) Clustering execution does not prepare the file slice with bootstrap file.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following changes to address these issues:\r\n- Fixes the file group reader to determine the base file size if the length is negative so that it does not cause the reader to skip reading the file;\r\n- Passes `-1` as the base file length when calling the file group reader from `HoodieCompactor` (compaction) and `HoodieSparkFileGroupReaderBasedMergeHandle` (clustering) so that the file group reader can automatically determine the size (the compaction and clustering plans do not have the file length information, unlike the file info provided by the file system view);\r\n- Removes the check on bootstrap file groups in `MultipleSparkJobExecutionStrategy` for enable clustering using file group reader on boostrap tables in Spark;\r\n- Passes in boostrap file, if present, to the file group reader in `MultipleSparkJobExecutionStrategy`;\r\n- Removes the check on bootstrap file groups in `HoodieCompactor` for enable compaction using file group reader on boostrap tables in Spark;\r\n- Adds more test coverage in `TestHoodieFileGroupReaderBase`, `TestHoodieFileGroupReaderOnSpark`, improves data validation in `TestDataSourceForBootstrap`; these tests, particularly `TestDataSourceForBootstrap#testMetadataBootstrapMORPartitionedInlineClustering` and `TestDataSourceForBootstrap#testMetadataBootstrapMORPartitionedInlineCompactionOn`, failed without the fix.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAs above for fixing functionality gap with file group reader in compaction and clustering in Spark\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-14T00:58:56Z","updated_at":"2025-01-22T07:39:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR
