is something that came up in discussion at a recent London Groovy and Grails User Group meetup.  It's a bit annoying having to use the three separate AST transformations that make up @Canonical to include the super class in the transformation(s).  I had a look at extending the @Canonical implementation to support this and this is what I came up with.\n\nThis adds a property called includeSuper to @Canonical which has has the same effect as setting @EqualsAndHashCode.callSuper, @ToString.includeSuper and @TupleConstructor.includeSuperProperties to true.  I've tried to keep this as low impact as possible so it shouldn't do anything unexpected.\n\nIs there anything I've overlooked here?\n\nAndy

is a proposition to easier event programming in Groovy. The feature is inspired from [C#'s Event Handler](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms366768.aspx) feature syntax and aims to be very similar to Qt's signals and slots feature to exchange messages between objects in an event-driven programming style. This is an idea I've had while working on [an android application written in Groovy](https://github.com/AugierLe42e/Pheobius)\n\nPlease note this is a very early work and I'm completely new in contributing to Groovy so please forgive me if I make big mistakes. I'm opening it very soon to have an early feedback.\n\nThe current system works like this :\n\n```\nclass ObjectWithEvent{\n    // Declare the event\n    public Event somethingChanged = new Event()\n\n    public void makeSomething()\n    // Code going on and then, something happens, you throw the event\n    somethingChanged(newValue)\n}\n\nclass ObjectListening{\n    //\n    private ObjectWithEvent objectWithEvent\n    public ObjectListening(){\n         // Subscribe to the event\n         objectWithEvent.somethingChanged += this.&onSomethingChanged\n    }\n\n    private void onSomethingChanged(int newValue){\n        // Code here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe main concern I have with the current implementation is the everything or nothing apsect. Either you make the event public but you are able to fire it from everywhere, either you make it private and you are not able to subscribe to it from outside. Maybe you can help me with that.\n\nThe other concern I have is the reaction it could have with the `@CompileStatic` anotation for the type of the Closure.\n\nPlease tell me if this work interests you.\nThank you.\n","created_at":"2015-04-21T11:52:14Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T08:25:18Z","closed_at":"2015-07-30T08:25:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38b643025267971cc35b62037ead04e6bc0f4db2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/4/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/4/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/4/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/b92e4bf0747186ea50a5c63c38275c6b43451ac9","head":{"label":null,"ref":"event-feature","sha":"b92e4bf0747186ea50a5c63c38275c6b43451ac9","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3e8a49a6abe98586c9656544b5a591eabe6b36da","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache
