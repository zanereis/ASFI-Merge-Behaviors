href=\"https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/releases\">hibernate-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Hibernate ORM 5.2.0</h2>\n<p>5.2.0 includes many improvements and bug-fixes.  For a complete list of changes, see <a href=\"https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HHH/versions/23150/tab/release-report-done\">https://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HHH/versions/23150/tab/release-report-done</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of the changes in 5.2.0 have important ramifications in terms of both usage and extension.  Be sure to read the 5.2 Migration Guide for details.</p>\n<p>Below is a discussion of the major changes.</p>\n<h2>Java 8 baseline</h2>\n<p>5.2 moves to Java 8 as its baseline.  This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>hibernate-java8</code> module has been removed, and that functionality has been moved into <code>hibernate-core</code>.</li>\n<li>Native support for Java 8 date/time types as Query parameters.</li>\n<li>Support for streaming (<code>java.util.stream.Stream</code>) query results.</li>\n<li>Support for <code>java.util.Optional</code> as return from methods that may return null.</li>\n<li>Leveraging Java 8 &quot;default methods&quot; when introducing new methods to extension points.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Consolidating JPA support into <code>hibernate-core</code>.</h2>\n<p>That effectively means that the <code>hibernate-entitymanager</code> module no longer exists.  Its functionality being consumed into <code>hibernate-core</code>.</p>\n<h2>JCache support</h2>\n<p>Support for using any JCache-compliant cache impl as a second-level caching provider.</p>\n<h2>Session-level batch size support</h2>\n<p>Support has been added for specifying a batch size for write operations per Session.</p>\n<h2>5th bug-fix release for 5.0</h2>\n<p>The 5th bug-fix release for Hibernate ORM 5.0.  This release and the upcoming 5.0.6 release have been done on an accelerated time-box of 2 weeks (from the normal 4 weeks for bug-fix releases) due to US holidays.</p>\n<p>The complete list of changes can be found <a href=\"http://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HHH/versions/21750\">here</a> (or <a href=\"https://hibernate.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10031&amp;version=21850\">here</a> for people without a Hibernate Jira account).</p>\n<p>For information on consuming the release via your favorite dependency-management-capable build tool, see <a href=\"http://hibernate.org/orm/downloads/\">http://hibernate.org/orm/downloads/</a></p>\n<p>For those of you allergic to dependency-management-capable build tools, the release bundles can be obtained from <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-orm/5.0.5.Final/\">SourceForge</a> or <a href=\"http://bintray.com/hibernate/bundles/hibernate-orm/5.0.5.Final\">BinTray</a>.</p>\n<h2>Fourth bug-fix release for 5.0</h2>\n<p>The fourth bug-fix release for Hibernate ORM 5.0</p>\n<p>There are 52 issues resolved in this release. 20 of those came out of the recent <a href=\"http://in.relation.to/2015/10/27/great-jira-cleanup-2015/\">Jira cleanup</a>. Initially that initiative pulled in roughly 750 issues. To date, 66 of those have been resolved - fixed or verified as out-of-date, unable-to-reproduce, etc. An additional 14 have been more properly reclassified as feature or enhancement requests rather than bugs. The really cool part is the amount of community help we have gotten in making that happen! Thanks to everyone responding, verifying and even fixing alot of these bugs!</p>\n<p>The complete list of changes can be found <a href=\"http://hibernate.atlassian.net/projects/HHH/versions/21750\">here</a>. <em>People without a Hibernate Jira account will not be able to access the previous link and can access the changelog in GitHub; the issue I reported with Atlassian has been resolved and is ready for deployment into our hosted environment, I just do not know when that will happen.</em></p>\n<p>For information on consuming the release via your favorite dependency-management-capable build tool, see <a href=\"http://hibernate.org/orm/downloads/\">http://hibernate.org/orm/downloads/</a></p>\n<p>For those of you allergic to dependency-management-capable build tools, the release bundles can be obtained from <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-orm/5.0.4.Final/\">SourceForge</a> or <a href=\"http://bintray.com/hibernate/bundles/hibernate-orm/5.0.4.Final\">BinTray</a>.</p>\n<h2>Third bug-fix release for 5.0</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://in.relation.to/2015/10/28/hibernate-orm-503-final-release/\">http://in.relation.to/2015/10/28/hibernate-orm-503-final-release/</a></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin \n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n## Tracking\n\nAll PR's generated as part of this fix are tracked here:
