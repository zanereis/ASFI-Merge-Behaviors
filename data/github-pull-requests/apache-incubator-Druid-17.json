If the generator is writing to a stream where the reader does not have some other mechanism to realize that an exception was thrown, this leads the reader to believe that the array is complete when it actually isn't.\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch, we disabled AUTO_CLOSE_JSON_CONTENT for JSON-wrapped SQL result formats in #11685, which fixed an issue where such results could be erroneously interpreted as complete. This patch fixes a similar issue with task reports, and all similar issues that may exist elsewhere, by disabling the feature globally.","created_at":"2024-02-10T05:29:18Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T16:12:30Z","closed_at":"2024-02-16T16:52:48Z","merged_at":"2024-02-16T16:52:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c41827dba2c16c377ebbdd34b4631e49e09f669","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

adding an if clause in a Github actions step, there is an implicit addition of a [success pre-condition](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#failure-with-conditions) on

In order to override this in the if clause to have it evaluated on failures as well, an explicit failure check needs to be added prior to the actual condition being tested.

Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the foundation set by https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14396 which introduced rolling supervisor restarts as a strategy to potentially reduce the number of task slots required for task handover in Druid. The primary goal of this PR is to refine the behavior and utilization of this feature by addressing two specific areas:\r\n\r\n1. **Dynamic Adjustment of stopTaskCount:** Previously, `stopTaskCount` defaulted to the value of `taskCount` if not explicitly specified in the Supervisor spec. This implicit behavior led to inconsistency when `taskCount` was manually increased, as `stopTaskCount` did not automatically adjust to reflect the new taskCount. This PR eliminates this implicit defaulting. Now, if `stopTaskCount` is not set, it remains null and is preserved as such, requiring explicit configuration to activate rolling restarts.\r\n2. **Optimized Task Cycling:** When `stopTaskCount` is configured to a low value (e.g., 1), it could lead to prolonged cycling and stopping of active tasks, especially for tasks that started earlier. To address this, the PR introduces logic to sort active running tasks by their start date, prioritizing the stopping of older tasks first. This approach aims to prevent early-started tasks from running excessively long, improving the overall efficiency of task cycling.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor` updated to sort task groups by start time to prioritize early termination of earlier groups \r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisorIOConfig` removed the automatic defaulting of `stopTaskCount` to `taskCount`, ensuring that `stopTaskCount` must be explicitly defined to influence the rolling restart behavior.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- #### Release note -->\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DirectDruidClientTest`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes an oversight after #14542 that happens in the SQL planner rewrite of `MV_CONTAINS` and `MV_OVERLAP` when faced with array elements that are `NULL`, where we were incorrectly using `EqualityFilter` instead of `NullFilter` for null elements (`EqualityFilter` does not accept null elements).\r\n\r\nWithout the changes of this PR, the added tests would fail with errors like:\r\n

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This functionality will allow the clusterName config for kafka-emitter to not need to necessarily be used as this new config allows for more flexibility to add n different dimensions.\r\nAlso made various nullable/nonnull annotation fixes\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUser configurable dimensions can be set via `druid.emitter.kafka.extra.dimensions` for events emitted by KafkaEmitter.

PR aims to simplify the working of a concurrent streaming ingestion job with a replacing commit.\r\n\r\nThe original approach required us to update the pending segments and send the mapping to the peon, and this can be error-prone with uncertainties.\r\n\r\nThis approach is as follows:\r\nWhen a segment is upgraded to another segment of a higher version, we store the original id as a descriptor in the newly created segment.\r\nThe CachingClusteredClient on the Broker then includes all overshadowed realtime segments (if any), except the higher versions of them which already exist on historicals. The filtered set of realtime segments are then included along with the segments returned by the lookup of the complete timeline in the set of segments to be processed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- Evaluate performance impact on queries\r\n- Clean up the pending segment and task communication methods used in the original approach\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-06T10:36:11Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T06:37:00Z","closed_at":"2024-03-19T06:37:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"73af90f7df689d8dff03def995b18cde22ddceed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2717749995,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE3NzQ5OTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR reworks how filter partitioning is performed, pushing it into `Filter` to \"bundle\" both index and value matcher creation, allowing filter partitioning to be done adaptively based on the selectivity of prior filters. This was alluded to during discussions in #12388, and contains and enhances the functionality added in #13977 (as well as removes the need to merge #15551), and aims to solve the problems originally described in #3878.\r\n\r\nThe main change centers around a new addition to the `Filter` interface,\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefault <T> FilterBundle makeFilterBundle(\r\n      ColumnIndexSelector columnIndexSelector,\r\n      BitmapResultFactory<T> bitmapResultFactory,\r\n      int selectionRowCount,\r\n      int totalRowCount,\r\n      boolean includeUnknown,\r\n      boolean allowPartialIndex\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor which a default implementation is provided that should be sufficient in most cases, and produces a new container type `FilterBundle`, \r\n\r\nProduction of the `FilterBundle` is assisted by a new method on `BitmapColumnIndex` \r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Nullable\r\n  default <T> T computeBitmapResult(\r\n      BitmapResultFactory<T> bitmapResultFactory,\r\n      int selectionRowCount,\r\n      int totalRowCount,\r\n      boolean includeUnknown\r\n  )\r\n```\r\nwhich allows index computation to factor `selectionRowCount` and `totalRowCount` into whether or not they should compute indexes, gauged based on the amount of work they need to do vs the amount of work it would take to just use a `ValueMatcher`/`VectorValueMatcher` and scan the 'remaining' rows. \r\n\r\nThe primary beneficiary of this is `AND` and `OR` filters, which can now partition not just on whether or not the sub-filter supports indexes at all, but also based on whether or not they _should_ use those indexes based on the selectivity of sub-filters whose indexes have already been computed, which itself is delegated to the sub-filters via the new `BitmapColumnIndex` method.\r\n\r\nThis can have a pretty dramatic performance impact:\r\n\r\nquery:\r\n```\r\n\"SELECT string2, SUM(long1) FROM foo WHERE string1 = '1000' AND string5 LIKE '%1%' AND (string3 in ('1', '10', '20', '22', '32') AND long2 IN (1, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 46) AND double3 < 1010.0 AND double3 > 1000.0 AND (string4 = '1' OR REGEXP_EXTRACT(string1, '^1') IS NOT NULL OR REGEXP_EXTRACT('Z' || string2, '^Z2') IS NOT NULL)) GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       41           5000000  explicit        false  avgt    5  455.417 Â± 12.678  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       41           5000000      auto        false  avgt    5  474.680 Â± 16.484  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       41           5000000  explicit        false  avgt    5  127.663 Â±  6.255  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       41           5000000      auto        false  avgt    5  125.231 Â± 16.176  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nquery:\r\n```\r\n\"SELECT SUM(long1) FROM foo WHERE string1 = '1000' AND string5 LIKE '%1%'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (stringEncoding)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000  explicit              none        false  avgt    3  294.571 Â± 51.248  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000  explicit              none        force  avgt    3  270.761 Â± 64.697  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000      auto              none        false  avgt    3  254.495 Â± 14.844  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000      auto              none        force  avgt    3  282.779 Â±  9.570  ms/op\r\n```\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000  explicit              none        false  avgt    3    9.897 Â±   3.995  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000  explicit              none        force  avgt    3    9.901 Â±   3.668  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000      auto              none        false  avgt    3    9.908 Â±   4.091  ms/op\r\nSqlNestedDataBenchmark.querySql       46           5000000      auto              none        force  avgt    3    9.876 Â±   3.121  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nnot even getting into doing anything fancy such as re-ordering sub-filters based on expected cost (for examples null and equality filters could always be evaluated first, then IN and range filters, followed by predicate and additional logical filters, i'll save all of this for follow-up work).\r\n\r\nCurrently only range and predicate based indexes are implementing this new functionality, but the 'IN' filter could also consider this for cases where it must check the entire set against the dictionary where the set is larger than the number of remaining rows to be scanned. Numeric range thresholds were chosen via benchmarking, which given how cheap numerical comparisons will skip indexes unless the range is quite a bit smaller than the number of rows to be scanned, but are wired to the same undocumented config added in #13977.\r\n\r\nPredicate based indexes are using a very conservative \"dictionary size greater than number of rows to be scanned\" threshold, which should be safe enough to not need any config, since the same or larger number of predicate operations would need to be done to compute the indexes (on top of unioning the indexes themselves) as if we just used a matcher for the remaining rows. This can likely be better, but I'll save that for follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\nThis functionality completely replaces `FilterAnalysis`, which was previously externally performing filter partitioning for the top level AND filter of a query, otherwise would all or nothing use the index or not when constructing offsets.\r\n\r\nThe new `makeFilterBundle` method should be significantly more powerful because the `AND` filter delegates this to its children, meaning that nested AND filters will _also_ be partitioned without doing any additional work or normalization.\r\n\r\nOR filters also implement `makeFilterBundle`, and have been reworked to allow partial index computation for the sake of creating a value matcher that checks the index set bits rather than computing the actual matcher. This functionality itself is not new, previously it lived in `FilteredOffset`, but now it has been moved inside of `OrFilter` which constructs this partial index matcher when constructing its `FilterBundle`.\r\n\r\nVisibility into the partitioning is available via debug logs, which will print how filters have been partitioned when enabled (it seemed too noisy to be `info` by default) and look something like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-02-07T01:31:03,314 DEBUG [processing_3b8e0608-ce11-48c2-baee-7a1a1f2492f1] org.apache.druid.segment.QueryableIndexCursorSequenceBuilder - Filter partitioning (30ms):{indexes=[{filter=\"channel = #en.wikipedia\", selectionSize=6650, buildTime=435Î¼s}, {filter=\"100 < delta as LONG < 500\", selectionSize=2725, buildTime=13998Î¼s}], matcher=[{filter=\"page LIKE '%1%'\"}, {filter=\"~(v0 IS NULL) || user = bob\", partialIndex={filter=\"user = bob\", selectionSize=0, buildTime=3382Î¼s}}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncurrently largely relying on the `Filter.toString` implementation to populate the details.\r\n\r\nThis feels like a safe change to make since everything is very conservative, so I have not retained the ability to force Druid to always use indexes, though I suppose it should be possible if there is demand for it.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, I believe there is further improvement to be made, but I think this is a good start.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nDruid query processing now adaptively determines when children of AND filters should compute indexes and when to simply match rows during the scan based on selectivity of other filters. We refer to this concept as 'filter partitioning', and it can result in quite a dramatic performance increase depending on the order which filters are written in the query.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine we have a query like `SELECT SUM(longColumn) FROM druid.table WHERE stringColumn1 = '1000' AND stringColumn2 LIKE '%1%'`. Clasically, Druid would always use indexes when processing filters if they are available. This is not always ideal though, imagine if `stringColumn1 = '1000'` matches 100 rows, if we are always using indexes we still have to find every value of `stringColumn2 LIKE '%1%'` that is true to compute the indexes for that filter, which if `stringColumn2` has more than 100 values ends up being worse than if the processing engine had simply checked for a match in those 100 remaining rows.\r\n\r\nWith the new logic in place, Druid now checks the selectivity of indexes as it processes each clause of the AND filter, and if it determines it would take more work to compute the index than to match the remaining rows, it skips computing the index.\r\n\r\nAs an end user, this means that the order you write filters in a `WHERE` clause of a query can now influence the performance of your queries. Don't worry, since Druid previously always used indexes if available, not ordering your filters cannot cause queries to be any slower than they were before. If you do want to explore this though, we recommend putting filter clauses with 'cheaper' to compute indexes such as `IS NULL`, `=`, and comparisons such as `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` near the front of `AND` filters to allow Druid to more efficiently process your queries. Future work will look into automatically processing these filters in the best order to take this burden off of the user, but for now feel free to play around with filter ordering to see if you can improve query performance. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Filter`\r\n * `BitmapColumnIndex`\r\n * `QueryableIndexCursorSequenceBuilder`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

lots of keys map to the same value, reversing a LOOKUP call can slow things down unacceptably. To protect against this, this patch introduces a parameter sqlReverseLookupThreshold representing the maximum size of an IN filter that will be created as part of lookup reversal.\r\n\r\nIf inSubQueryThreshold is set to a smaller value than sqlReverseLookupThreshold, then inSubQueryThreshold will be used instead. This allows users to use that single parameter to control IN sizes if they wish.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks follow. I chose `10000` as the default for `sqlReverseLookupThreshold` since it keeps planning time under 1 second. Future work to speed up IN filters could allow us to raise the default threshold.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                (keysPerValue)  (lookupType)  (numKeys)  Mode  Cnt     Score

Description\r\n\r\nPassthroughAggregatorFactory overrides a deprecated method in the AggregatorFactory, on which it relies on for serializing one of its fields `complexTypeName`. This was accidentally removed, leading to a bug in the factory, where the type name doesn't get serialized properly, and places `null` in the type name. This PR revives that method with a different name and adds tests for the same. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `PassthroughAggregatorFactory`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.61.1</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<p>xds: Fix a bug in <code>WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer</code> policy that could raise <code>NullPointerException</code> and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel. This bug can only be triggered when connection can not be established and the channel reports <code>TRANSIENT_FAILURE</code> state. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10868\">#10868</a>)</p>\n<h2>v1.61.0</h2>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove unused experimental API ManagedChannelBuilder.enableFullStreamDecompression (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10744\">#10744</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Deprecate LoadBalancer.EMPTY_PICKER added in 1.58.0 in favor of FixedResultPicker (860b5cb1f)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>binder: Experimental support for asynchronous security policies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10566\">#10566</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: reduce CompositeReadableBuffer allocation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/3279\">#3279</a>)</li>\n<li>core: Improve error message clarity when a channel leak is detected (201893f5e)</li>\n<li>util: use shared index across <code>round_robin</code> pickers (dca89b25b). This makes its implementation more similar to <code>weighted_round_robin</code>.</li>\n<li>xds: Implement ADS stream flow control mechanism (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10674\">#10674</a>). This limits the maximum memory consumed if the control plane sends updates more rapidly than they can be processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Check outbound maximum message size for the compressed size in addition to the already-checked uncompressed size (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10739\">#10739</a>). Fixed the status code to be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead of UNKNOWN.</li>\n<li>util: Fix NPE when multiple addresses are in an address group for petiole load balancer policies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10769\">#10769</a>)</li>\n<li>util: Disable publishing of fixtures (8ac43dd81). The Gradle test fixtures are for use by grpc-java's internal tests.</li>\n<li>okhttp: Ignore known conscrypt socket close issue (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10812\">#10812</a>). This stops an exception from being thrown when a known Conscrypt synchronization issue happens.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop support for Bazel 5 (55a9c012c). Bazel 7 is available, and Protobuf has already dropped support for Bazel 5.</li>\n<li>Change many compile deps to runtime deps (d6830d7f9). This reduces the transitive classes &quot;leaked&quot; into the compile classpath. In particular, grpc-core (<code>io.grpc.internal</code>) will be less frequently included transitively at compile time.</li>\n<li>Upgrade dependencies (c985797d9)\n<ul>\n<li>Protobuf to 3.25.1</li>\n<li>auto-value-annotations to 1.10.4</li>\n<li>error_prone_annotations to 2.23.0</li>\n<li>proto-google-common-protos to 2.29.0</li>\n<li>google-cloud-logging to 3.15.14</li>\n<li>guava to 32.1.3-android</li>\n<li>okio to 3.4.0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Gordiychuk\"><code>@âGordiychuk</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jroper\"><code>@âjroper</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jyane\"><code>@âjyane</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ulfjack\"><code>@âulfjack</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.60.2</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<p>xds: Fix a bug in <code>WeightedRoundRobinLoadBalancer</code> policy that could raise <code>NullPointerException</code> and further cause channel panic when picking a subchannel.

druid web-console to suggest using the azureStorage input type instead of the azure input type due to changes from

input type so the console should suggest using it instead.\r\n\r\nimo using a sas token for authentication is the best solution (outside of using managed auth) because sas tokens can be short lived.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n- Updated azure ingestion tiles to use the azureStorage input source\r\n- allow specifying a static sas token through the console.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Updates to the web-console to use new input spec for azure\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

As part of that code we are also subscribing for the special `BOOKMARK` event on the watcher, it is to prevent clients for overfetching from the Kubernetes API server, however, we are not handling this event properly. Specifically it does not include any metadata and is only meant to update the resourceVersion for the next call. This PR handles that.\r\n\r\nCurrently monitoring in our staging cluster.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n\r\nThe following would appear in logs for BOOKMARK events. However, since ADDED and REMOVED events are handled correctly the system would operate more-or-less correctly, only that resourceVersion was never updated because of the exception thrown, so less efficiently.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.druid.k8s.discovery.K8sDruidNodeDiscoveryProvider$NodeRoleWatcher - Error while watching node type [INDEXER]\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"java.util.Map.get(Object)\" because the return value of \"io.kubernetes.client.openapi.models.V1ObjectMeta.getAnnotations()\" is null\r\n        at org.apache.druid.k8s.discovery.DefaultK8sApiClient.getDiscoveryDruidNodeFromPodDef(DefaultK8sApiClient.java:100) ~[?:?]\r\n        at org.apache.druid.k8s.discovery.DefaultK8sApiClient.access$000(DefaultK8sApiClient.java:48) ~[?:?]\r\n        at org.apache.druid.k8s.discovery.DefaultK8sApiClient$2.hasNext(DefaultK8sApiClient.java:139) ~[?:?]\r\n        at org.apache.druid.k8s.discovery.K8sDruidNodeDiscoveryProvider$NodeRoleWatcher.keepWatching(K8sDruidNodeDiscoveryProvider.java:268) ~[?:?]\r\n        at org.apache.druid.k8s.discovery.K8sDruidNodeDiscoveryProvider$NodeRoleWatcher.watch(K8sDruidNodeDiscoveryProvider.java:237) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:539) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:264) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1136) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:635) ~[?:?]\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:840) ~[?:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\nThe initial step in optimizing segment metadata was to centralize the construction of datasource schema in the Coordinator (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14985). Thereafter, we addressed the problem of publishing schema for realtime segments (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15475). Subsequently, our goal is to eliminate the requirement for regularly executing queries to obtain segment schema information. \r\n\r\nThis is the final change which involves publishing segment schema for finalized segments from task and periodically polling them in the Coordinator. \r\n\r\n## Design \r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\n#### Schema Table \r\n\r\nTable Name: `SegmentSchema`\r\nPurpose: Store unique schema for segment. \r\n\r\nColumns \r\n\r\n| Column Name | Data Type | Description \r\n| -------------- | ---------- | ------------\r\n| id | autoincrement | primary key \r\n| created_date | varchar | creation time, allows filtering schema created after a point \r\n| datasource | varchar | datasource \r\n| fingerprint | varchar | unique identifier for the schema, sha-256 hash of payload, datasource & version \r\n| payload | blob | includes rowSignature, aggregatorFactories      \r\n| used | boolean | true if the schema is referenced by `used` segments \r\n| used_status_last_updated | varchar |  timestamp when the used status was last updated \r\n| version | int | schema version \r\n\r\n#### Segments Table \r\nNew columns will be added to the already existing `Segments` table. \r\n\r\nColumns \r\n| Column Name | Data Type | Description \r\n|---------------| -----------| ------------\r\n| num_rows | long | number of rows in the segment \r\n| schema_fingerprint | string | schema fingerprint \r\n\r\n### Task \r\nChanges are required in the task to publish schema along with segment metadata. \r\n- Introduce a new class `SchemaPayload` to encapsulate RowSignature and AggregatorFactories. \r\n- Introduce a new class `SegmentSchemaMetadata` to encapsulate `SchemaPayload` and `numRows`. \r\n- Introduce a new class `SegmentSchemaMapping` to encapsulate schema and numRows information for multiple segments. \r\n- Update `SegmentInsertAction`, `SegmentTransactionalReplaceAction`, `SegmentTransactionalAppendAction` & `SegmentTransactionalInsertAction` to take in segment schema. \r\n- Changes in AbstractBatchIndexTask#buildPublishAction to take segment schema.  \r\n- Changes in SegmentAndCommitMetadata to take segment schema. \r\n- Changes in TransactionalSegmentPublisher to take segment schema for publishing to the DB. \r\n\r\n#### Streaming \r\n- Changes in `StreamAppenderator` to get the RowSignature, AggregatorFactories and numRows for the segment. \r\n\r\n#### Batch \r\n- AppenderatorImpl#push to build the segment schema and add it to SegmentsAndCommitMetadata. \r\n- BatchAppenderator#push to build the segment schema and add it to SegmentsAndCommitMetadata.\r\n\r\n##### IndexTask \r\n- Changes in BatchAppenderatorDriver#publishAll to pass segment schema for publishing. \r\n- Change in IndexTask#generateAndPublishSegments to fetch segment schema from pushed segments and publish. \r\n\r\n##### ParallelIndexSupervisorTask \r\n- Changes in ParallelIndexSupervisorTask#publishSegments to combine segment schema from segments and publish them. \r\n- SinglePhaseSubTask \r\n- PartialSegmentMergeTask \r\n\r\n\r\n#### MSQ\r\n- Changes in `SegmentGeneratorFrameProcessor` to return segment schema along with segment metadata. \r\n- Changes in `SegmentGeneratorFrameProcessorFactory` and `ControllerImpl`. \r\nNote, these changes are reverted for now. \r\n\r\n### Overlord \r\nChanges are required in the Overlord (`IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordintor`) to persist the schema along with segment metadata in the database. \r\n\r\n### Coordinator\r\n\r\n#### Schema Poll  \r\nChanges in `SqlSegmentsMetadataManager` to poll schema along with segments. \r\nAlso poll `schema_id` and `num_rows` additionally from segments table. \r\nUpdate schema cache. \r\n\r\n#### Schema Caching \r\nMaintain a cache of segment schema. Refer `SegmentSchemaCache`.  \r\nIt caches following information, \r\n\r\n| Information | Writer | Cleanup \r\n|------------ | ------ | ---------\r\n| SegmentMetadata . SegmentId -> schema fingerprint, numRows | Replaced on each DB poll | Not required. \r\n| Schema for finalised segments. Schema fingerprint -> SchemaPayload | Replaced on each DB poll. | Not required.   \r\n| Realtime segment schema. SegmentId -> SegmentSchemaMetadata | Whenever Peons push schema update. |  When the segment is removed. \r\n| SMQResults which are not published. SegmentId -> SegmentSchemaMetadata | Added after SMQ query is executed. | If SegmentSchemaBackFill queue successfully writes the schema to the database, it is removed from this map. \r\n| SMQResults which have been published. SegmentId -> SegmentSchemaMetadata | Added after segment schema is published to the DB. | Cleared after each DB Poll. \r\n\r\n#### SegmentMetadataCache changes \r\nChanges in `AbstractSegmentMetadataCache` class to add new method which will be overridden by child classes, \r\n- `additionalInitializationCondition`\r\n- `removeSegmentAction`\r\n- `segmentMetadataQueryResultHandler`\r\n\r\nChanges in `CoordinatorSegmentMetadataCache` to override methods from `AbstractSegmentMetadataCache`, \r\n- Implement `additionalInitializationCondition` to wait for the segmentSchemaCache to be initialized. \r\n- Implement `removeSegmentAction` to remove the schema from the schema cache. \r\n- Override `segmentMetadataQueryResultHandler` to additionally publish and cache the schema. \r\n\r\n#### Schema Backfill \r\nAdded a new class `SegmentSchemaBackFillQueue` which accepts segment schema and publish them in batch. \r\n\r\n#### Schema Cleanup \r\nCoordinatorDuty to clean up schema which is not referenced by any segment.  \r\n\r\n#### Coordinator leader flow changes \r\n* `CoordinatorSegmentMetadataCache` refresh is executed only on the leader node. \r\n* `CoordinatorSegmentMetadataCache` timeline callback continue to function on all Coordinator nodes.\r\n* `SegmentSchemaCache` is populated only on the leader node, except for the realtime schema information which is updated on all Coordinator nodes. \r\n* `SegmentSchemaBackFillQueue` functions only on the leader node. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n* The changes have been tested locally with the wikipedia dataset. \r\n* Unit test has been added. \r\n* All of the existing integration tests have been tested with feature enabled (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15817/commits/e8a6d9b603e64a6c5dbb32389eec50efe0808854).\r\n* Integration test with the group name `centralized-table-schema` runs successfully.\r\n* The changes have also been tested in a Druid cluster. \r\n\r\n## Upgrade considerations\r\nThe general upgrade order should be followed. The new code is behind a feature flag, so it is compatible with existing setups. Task with new changes can communicate with old version of Overlord. \r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\nThis feature addresses multiple challenges outlined in the linked issue. To enable it, set `druid.centralizedDatasourceSchema.enabled`.\r\nIf MM is used then set `druid.indexer.fork.property.druid.centralizedDatasourceSchema.enabled`. \r\n\r\nWhen the feature is enabled, \r\n- Realtime segment schema change would be periodically pushed to the Coordinator,\r\n- Finalized segment schema would be written to the metadata database.\r\n- Coordinator would poll the schema along with segment metadata. \r\n- Coordinator would build the datasource schema and broker would fetch it from the Coordinator. \r\n\r\nTo rollback, simply turn off the feature flag. The database schema change is not rolled back on turning off the feature.\r\n\r\nNew configs,\r\n| Name | Purpose | \r\n|---------|--------|\r\n| `druid.coordinator.kill.segmentSchema.on` | Config to enabled kill segment schema Coordinator duty | \r\n| `druid.coordinator.kill.segmentSchema.period` | Kill segment schema Coordinator duty period | \r\n| `druid.coordinator.kill.segmentSchema.durationToRetain` | Duration to retain segment schema after being marked as unused. |\r\n\r\nImportant metrics to track, \r\n| Metric |  Purpose |\r\n|------------ | ------ | \r\n| `metadatacache/schemaPoll/count` | Number of coordinator polls to fetch datasource schema. |\r\n| `metadatacache/schemaPoll/failed` | Number of failed coordinator polls to fetch datasource schema. |\r\n| `metadatacache/schemaPoll/time`|Time taken for coordinator polls to fetch datasource schema.\r\n| `metadatacache/init/time` | Time taken to initialize the coordinator segment metadata cache. Depends on the number of segments. |\r\n|`metadatacache/refresh/count` | Number of segments to refresh in coordinator segment metadata cache. |\r\n|`metadatacache/refresh/time` | Time taken to refresh segments in coordinator segment metadata cache. |\r\n|`metadatacache/backfill/count`| Number of segments for which schema was backfill in the DB. | \r\n|`schemacache/realtime/size`| Number of realtime segment for which schema is cached. | \r\n|`schemacache/finalizedSegmentMetadata/size`| Number of finalized segments for which schema is cached. |\r\n|`schemacache/finalizedSchemaPayload/size`| Number of distinct schema payload cached. |\r\n|`schemacache/inTransitSMQResults/size`| Number of segment schema cached as a result of SMQ. |\r\n|`schemacache/inTransitSMQPublishedResults/size`| Number of segment schema backfilled in the DB. | \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR fixes 2 issues with Streaming ingestion with concurrent replace.\r\n\r\n1) Temporary duplicate results in queries\r\nSuppose a streaming ingestion task has open segments V0-1 with a used segment V0-0, and a replace occurs concurrently with version V1. The replace job would convert the used segment to V1-0, and the open pending segment to V1-1.\r\nHowever, when the appending job commits segments using the transactional append action, the pending segment is committed as V1-2. This means that there could be a period where V1-1 has not been unannounced, and V1-2 has been loaded, during which both results are visible.\r\nThis PR aims to remove that redundancy by committing V1-1 directly.\r\n\r\n2) Temporary data loss in queries\r\nCurrently, handoff for streaming ingestion looks only at the original set of segments to the append action. This PR enhances the notifier to look at the upgraded segments as well. Without this change, an append that happens after a replace may miss data that relies on the handoff.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

conjecture with `druid.server.http.maxSubqueryBytes=auto` or any other value e.g. \"100000\".

Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nIt might be nice to test the read from a different storage account functionality as well (these tests still read from a single storage account), but I think that should be a separate change.\r\n\r\nI tested these cases locally and they all succeeded as expected.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this

aims to solve https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15739 by introducing a change in the native query plan for Windowing query where a query like \r\n```\r\nWITH virtual_table as (select m2 ,sum(m1) as summ1\r\nfrom foo group by 1 order by summ1 DESC)\r\nselect m2,summ1,sum(summ1) OVER (order by m2 rows between 1 PRECEDING and 2 FOLLOWING) as sumfinal\r\nfrom virtual_table order by 1\r\n```\r\nwill be planned in the `between 1 PRECEDING and 2 FOLLOWING` part as \r\n```\r\n\"processor\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"framedAgg\",\r\n            \"frame\": {\r\n              \"peerType\": \"ROWS\",\r\n              \"lowUnbounded\": false,\r\n              \"lowOffset\": -1,\r\n              \"uppUnbounded\": false,\r\n              \"uppOffset\": 2,\r\n              \"orderBy\": null\r\n            },\r\n            \"aggregations\": [\r\n              {\r\n                \"type\": \"doubleSum\",\r\n                \"name\": \"w0\",\r\n                \"fieldName\": \"a0\"\r\n              }\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to support all the cases which postgres supports such as \r\n```\r\nbetween 1 PRECEDING and 2 FOLLOWING\r\nbetween 2 PRECEDING and 1 PRECEDING\r\nbetween 1 FOLLOWING and 2 FOLLOWING\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will also handle cases with a meaningful error where the upper offset is of a lesser value than the lower offset such as \r\n```\r\nbetween 1 PRECEDING and 2 PRECEDING\r\nbetween 2 FOLLOWING and 1 FOLLOWING\r\n```\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the

a bug introduced in #15609, where queries involving filters on TIME_FLOOR could encounter ClassCastException when comparing RangeValue in CombineAndSimplifyBounds.\r\n\r\nPrior to #15609, CombineAndSimplifyBounds would remove, rebuild, and re-add all numeric range filters as part of consolidating numeric range filters for the same column under the least restrictive type. #15609 included a change to only rebuild numeric range filters when a consolidation opportunity actually arises. The bug was introduced because the unconditional rebuild, as a side effect, masked the fact that in some cases range filters on `__time` would be created with string match values and a LONG match value type.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the fixup to happen at the time the range filter is initially created, rather than in CombineAndSimplifyBounds.","created_at":"2024-01-29T17:00:48Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T21:30:50Z","closed_at":"2024-01-29T21:30:47Z","merged_at":"2024-01-29T21:30:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"38a1e827ab0375317bef0db0cf30a944c9147770","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

a issue with ingesting using the azureStorage input source when not running on azure itself.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/commit/3e512249e37407c0ece2b241d4b16e448eb18f0a\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAzureStorageAccountInputSource injects AzureAccountConfig because it builds a AzureIngestClientFactory to handle pulling azure blobs for ingestion. AzureIngestClientFactory uses AzureAccountConfig for retry configs when hitting blob storage and for default credentials if credentials are not specified in AzureStorageAccountInputSource.properties.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is AzureAccountConfig cannot be injected if druid.azure.account is not set, which it won't be if someone is e.g. trying to ingest azure blobs from a cluster deployed in aws. The config's value itself is ignored since the actual storage account is specified in AzureStorageAccountInputSource, so the currrent workaround is to just it to a dummy value.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nI think it would be ideal to remove AzureAccountConfig from being injected in AzureStorageAccountInputSource entirely (since its more a config for specifying azure as deep storage rather than a ingestion source), but I don't think this is possible without e.g. removing the convenient feature where you use a cluster's regular azure authentication (for deep storage) if no additional credentials are specified in the ingestion spec.\r\n\r\nFor now I just made druid.azure.account nullable in AzureAccountConfig and added a check in AzureStorageDruidModule to make sure the value is not null when the cluster is using azure as deep storage (rather than just as a ingestion source)\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Bugfix for reading azure blobs with the azureStorage input type\r\n- \r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `AzureAccountConfig`\r\n * `AzureStorageDruidModule`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
