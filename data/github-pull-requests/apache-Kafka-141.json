implements KIP-219, where a broker return a response with throttle time on quota violation immediately after processing the corresponding request. After the response is sent out, the broker will keep the channel muted until the throttle time is over. Also, on receiving a response with throttle time, client will also block outgoing communication to the broker for the specified throttle time.\r\n\r\nIn the original KIP, it was stated that \"In order to let the clients know whether the received response is already throttled or not, we will need to bump up all the related request version.\" However, after further discussion with @lindong28 and @becketqin, it was decided to bump up the protocol version of ApiVersionsRequest/Response only, which should be sufficient to detect the throttling behavior of the brokers that each client communicate

Edoardo Comar ecomar@uk.ibm.com\r\nCo-authored-by: Mickael Maison mickael.maison@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThis KIP adds the String value of the ListenerName used for the connection to the AuthenticationContext.\r\n\r\nThis allows PrincipalBuilders to retrieve this value and build different Principal based on the source of the connection. This is especially interesting in deployments where inter-broker traffic is on a different network/listener than user traffic or when the same protocol is used by several listeners.\r\n\r\nThe change in itself is mostly \"plumbing\" as the listener name needs to be passed from `ChannelBuilders` all the way down to all classes implementing `AuthenticationContext`. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

ConsumerPerformance fails to consume all messages \r\non topics with large number of partitions due to a relatively short default polling loop timeout (1000 ms) that is not reachable and modifiable by the end user. \r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nCreate a topic of 10 000 partitions, send a 50 000 000 of 100 byte records using kafka-producer-perf-test and consume them using kafka-consumer-perf-test (ConsumerPerformance). You will likely notice that the number of records returned by the kafka-consumer-perf-test is many times less than expected 50 000 000. \r\n\r\nThis happens due to specific ConsumerPerformance implementation. As the result, in some rough cases it may take a long enough time to process/iterate through the records polled in batches, thus, the time may exceed the default hardcoded polling loop timeout and this is probably not what we want from this utility. \r\n\r\n### Possible options\r\n1) Increasing polling loop timeout in ConsumerPerformance implementation. It defaults to 1000 ms and is hardcoded, thus cannot be changed but we could export it as an OPTIONAL kafka-consumer-perf-test parameter to enable it on a script level configuration and available to the end user.\r\n2) Decreasing max.poll.records on a Consumer config level. This is not a fine option though since we do not want to touch the default settings.\r\n\r\n[KAFKA-6743: ConsumerPerformance fails to consume all messages on topics with large number of

unintentionally included extra raw class files in the release tarballs by making the .class file output (instead of the jar) for a streams a dependency of the streams-test-utils. This fixes that issue by instead breaking the circular dependency by using a `compileOnly`/`provided` dependency on those sources and also including the dependency as a test dependency.\r\n\r\nI verified by using `gradlew clean installAll releaseTarGzAll`, then checking that the release tarball doesn't have the extraneous files and the installed pom file has the expected dependencies. The dependency on kafka-streams is now in the `test` scope, but that should be fine since a streams application would only use this dependency if it already had a dependency on streams in `compile` (or in weird edge cases the user could handle specifying the right dependencies). This actually seems to even be an improvement over the previous situation where the actual dependency was not expressed in the pom at all (since the dependency was on the sourceSet output rather than the actual project).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

Summary of the problem\r\nWhen the `header.converter` is not specified in the worker config or the connector config, a bug in the `Plugins` test causes it to never instantiate the `HeaderConverter` instance, even though there is a default value.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem as soon as the connector deals with headers, either in records created by a source connector or in messages on the Kafka topics consumed by a sink connector. As soon as that happens, a NPE occurs.\r\n\r\nA workaround is to explicitly set the `header.converter` configuration property, but this was added in AK 1.1 and thus means that upgrading to AK 1.1 will not be backward compatible and will require this configuration change.\r\n\r\n## The Changes\r\n\r\nThe `Plugins.newHeaderConverter` methods were always returning null if the `header.converter` configuration value was not specified in the supplied connector or worker configuration. Thus, even though the `header.converter` property has a default, it was never being used.\r\n\r\nThe fix was to only check whether a `header.converter` property was specified when the connector configuration was being used, and if no such property exists in the connector configuration to return null. Then, when the worker configuration is being used, the method simply gets the `header.converter` value (or the default if no value was explicitly set).\r\n\r\nAlso, the ConnectorConfig had the same default value for the `header.converter` property as the WorkerConfig, but this resulted in very confusing log messages that implied the default header converter should be used even when the worker config specified the `header.converter` value. By removing the default, the log messages now make sense, and the Worker still properly instantiates the correct header converter.\r\n\r\nFinally, updated comments and added log messages to make it more clear which converters are being used and how they are being converted.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSeveral new unit tests for `Plugins.newHeaderConverter` were added to check the various behavior. Additionally, the runtime JAR with these changes was built and inserted into an AK 1.1 installation, and a source connector was manually tested with 8 different combinations of settings for the `header.converter` configuration:\r\n\r\n1. default value\r\n1. worker configuration has `header.converter` explicitly set to the default\r\n1. worker configuration has `header.converter` set to a custom `HeaderConverter` implementation in the same plugin\r\n1. worker configuration has `header.converter` set to a custom `HeaderConverter` implementation in a _different_ plugin\r\n1. connector configuration has `header.converter` explicitly set to the default\r\n1. connector configuration has `header.converter` set to a custom `HeaderConverter` implementation in the same plugin\r\n1. connector configuration has `header.converter` set to a custom `HeaderConverter` implementation in a _different_ plugin\r\n1. worker configuration has `header.converter` explicitly set to the default, and the connector configuration has `header.converter` set to a custom `HeaderConverter` implementation in a _different_ plugin\r\n\r\nThe worker created the correct `HeaderConverter` implementation with the correct configuration in all of these tests.\r\n\r\nFinally, the default configuration was used with the aforementioned custom source connector that generated records with headers, and an S3 connector that consumes the records with headers (but didn't do anything with them). This test also passed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

the group coordinator, we currently we check whether the partition is owned before checking whether it is loading. Since loading is a prerequisite for partition ownership, it means that it is not actually possible to see the COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS error. The impact is mostly harmless: while loading the group, the client may send unnecessary FindCoordinator requests to rediscover the coordinator. I've fixed the bug and restructured the code to enable testing.\r\n\r\nIn the process of fixing this bug, I made the following minor changes:\r\n\r\n1. We now verify valid groupId in all request handlers.\r\n2. Currently if the coordinator is loading when a SyncGroup is received, we'll return NOT_COORDINATOR. I've changed this to return REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS since the rebalance state will have been lost on coordinator failover. This effectively forces the consumer to rejoin the group, which seems preferable over unnecessarily rediscovering the coordinator. \r\n3. I added a check for the COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS handler in SyncGroup. Although we do not currently return this error, it seems reasonable that we might want to some day, so it seems better to get the check in now.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

in data centre are sometimes grouped in racks.

currently assumes that passwords encoded with one secret will fail with an exception if decoded with another secret and configures an old.secret in `setUp`. This could potentially cause test failures if a password was incorrectly decoded with the wrong secret, since the test writes passwords encoded with the new secret directly to ZooKeeper. Since old.secret is only used in one test for verifying secret rotation, this config can be moved to that test to avoid transient failures.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

Trogdor should support destroying tasks\r\n\r\nImplement destroying tasks and workers.  This means erasing all record of them on the Coordinator and the Agent.\r\nWorkers should be identified by unique 64-bit worker IDs, rather than by the names of the tasks they are implementing.  This ensures that when a task is destroyed and re-created with the same task ID, the old workers will be not be treated as part of the new task instance.    \r\n\r\nFix some return results from RPCs.  In some cases RPCs were returning values that were never used.  Attempting to re-create the same task ID with different arguments should fail.  Add RequestConflictException to represent HTTP error code 409 (CONFLICT) for this scenario.\r\n\r\nIf only one worker in a task stops, don't stop all the other workers for that task, unless the worker

WorkerUtils will be able to create topics when there is no security. To be able to work with secure kafka, WorkerUtils.createTopic() needs to be able to take security configs. This PR adds commonClientConf field to both producer bench and roundtrip workload specs so that users can specify security and other common configs once for producer/consumer and adminClient. Also added adminClientConf field to workload specs so that users can specify adminClient specific configs if they want to. For completeness, added consumerConf and producerConf to roundtrip workload spec.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

were unintentionally mutating the cached queue of batches prior to appending to the log. This could have several bad consequences if the append ultimately failed or was truncated. In the reporter's case, it caused the snapshot to be invalid after a segment roll. The snapshot contained producer state at offsets higher than the snapshot offset. If we ever had to load from that snapshot, the state was left inconsistent, which led to an error that ultimately crashed the replica fetcher.\r\n\r\nThe fix required some refactoring to avoid sharing the same underlying queue inside `ProducerAppendInfo`. I have added test cases which reproduce the invalid snapshot state. I have also made an effort to clean up logging since it was not easy to track this problem down.\r\n\r\nOne final note: I have removed the duplicate check inside `ProducerStateManager` since it was both redundant and incorrect. The redundancy was in the checking of the cached batches: we already check these in `Log.analyzeAndValidateProducerState`. The incorrectness was the handling of sequence number overflow: we were only handling one very specific case of overflow, but others would have resulted in an invalid assertion. Instead, we now throw `OutOfOrderSequenceException`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build
