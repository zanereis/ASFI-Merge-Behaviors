What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change output of v2 `DESCRIBE TABLE`, and make it the same as v1. In particular:\r\n1. Return NULL instead of empty strings when any comment doesn't exist in the schema info.\r\n2. When a v2 table has identity transformations (partition by) only, output the partitioning info in v1 style. For instance:\r\n```sql\r\n> CREATE TABLE tbl (id bigint, data string) USING _;\r\n> DESCRIBE TABLE tbl;\r\n+-----------------------+---------+-------+\r\n|col_name               |data_type|comment|\r\n+-----------------------+---------+-------+\r\n|id                     |bigint   |null   |\r\n|data                   |string   |null   |\r\n|# Partition Information|         |       |\r\n|# col_name             |data_type|comment|\r\n|id                     |bigint   |null   |\r\n+-----------------------+---------+-------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso the PR moves/adds some tests to the base traits:\r\n- \"DESCRIBE TABLE of a non-partitioned table\"\r\n- \"DESCRIBE TABLE of a partitioned table\"\r\n\r\nand addresses review comments in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35265.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes unify outputs of v1 and v2 implementations, and make the migration process from the version v1 to v2

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIt turns out that I was wrong in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36727 . We still have the limitation (column name cannot contain dot) in master and 3.3 braches, in a very implicit way: The `V2ExpressionBuilder` has a boolean flag `nestedPredicatePushdownEnabled` whose default value is false. When it's false, it uses `PushableColumnWithoutNestedColumn` to match columns, which doesn't support dot in names.\r\n\r\n`V2ExpressionBuilder` is only used in 2 places:\r\n1. `PushableExpression`. This is a pattern match that is only used in v2 agg pushdown\r\n2. `PushablePredicate`. This is a pattern match that is used in various places, but all the caller sides set `nestedPredicatePushdownEnabled` to true.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `nestedPredicatePushdownEnabled` flag from `V2ExpressionBuilder`, and makes it always support nested fields. `PushablePredicate` is also updated accordingly to remove the boolean flag, as it's always true.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a mistake to eliminate an unexpected limitation in DS v2 pushdown.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo for end users. For data source developers, they can trigger agg pushdowm more often.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\na new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe documentation of the function `pyspark.sql.functions.timestamp_seconds` currently features an example but no text describing the function. This PR adds the missing text based on the docstring of `pyspark.sql.functions.from_unixtime`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe docstring is currently missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR adds a docstring that will be published in Spark's documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests were added because this PR just adds text in a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR borrows the idea from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36928 but adds some more changes in order for scheduled jobs to share the `precondition` so all conditional logic is consolidated here.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a new option to `is-changed.py` so dependent modules can be checked together. In this way, we don't have to change `build_and_test.yml` often when we add a new module.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR removes `type` because `precondition` job now replaces it.\r\n\r\nLastly, this PR enables PySpark, SparkR TPC-DS and Docker integration tests for scheduled jobs when applicable.\r\n\r\nCloses #36928\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to read.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested locally and in my fork

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Add session catalog name in identifiers, then all identifiers will be 3 part name\r\n- Make `CatalogImpl#refreshTable` support 3 part name. This option is required since a lot of command use this method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make it more clearer that this table or function comes from which catalog. It affects:\r\n\r\n- the scan table of the query plan\r\n- the target table of the data writing\r\n- desc database\r\n- desc table\r\n- desc function\r\n\r\nNote that, we do not support view catalog so we do not add catalog for view at this pr.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nmaybe yes, so add a new config `spark.sql.legacy.identifierOutputCatalogName` to restore the old behavior\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, `InferFiltersFromConstraints` construct a new `Filter` which condition without the same order in scala 2.12 and 2.13\r\n\r\nIt seems `--` of `ExpressionSet` cannot guarantee the order of elements.\r\n\r\nThe behavior lead to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35947#discussion_r901193520\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bug\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\nThe behavior will be consistent between scala 2.12 and 2.13\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`Left  ExpressionSet-- Right ExpressionSet`  in Scala 2.13 will use default `--` of `scala.collection.Set` as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef -- (that: IterableOnce[A]): C = fromSpecific(coll.toSet.removedAll(that))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Left ExpressionSet` will convert to a `immutable.Set` and the `ExpressionSet` cannot override the `removedAll` method of `immutable.Set` due to it's a `scala.collection.Set`.\r\n\r\nSo this pr override `--` method for `ExpressionSet` in Scala 2.13 to to take over the action to ensure it return the same result as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to separate workflows for each scheduled jobs. After this PR, each scheduled build can be easily searched at https://github.com/apache/spark/actions. For example, as below:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-20 at 6 01 04 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/174565779-ab54eb69-49f9-4746-b714-902741e1d554.png)\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR switches ANSI build to a scheduled build too because it's too expensive to run it for each commit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently it is very inconvenient to navigate scheduled jobs now. We should use https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml?query=event%3Aschedule link and manually search one by one.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in my fork (https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/actions).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances `PushPredicateThroughNonJoin` to make it do not push down complex filter condition if current project does not contain other

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Move `DESCRIBE TABLE` parsing tests to `DescribeRelationParserSuite`.\r\n2. Put common `DESCRIBE TABLE` tests into one trait `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.DescribeTableSuiteBase`, and put datasource specific tests to the `v1.DescribeTableSuite` and `v2.DescribeTableSuite`.\r\n\r\nThe changes follow the approach of #30287.\r\n\r\nCloses #36671.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The unification will allow to run common `DESCRIBE TABLE` tests for both DSv1/Hive DSv1 and DSv2\r\n2. We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *DDLParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *HiveDDLSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand new test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *DescribeTableParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35216 to support more cases. \r\n\r\nBefore this PR it only supports left semi/anti join followed by limit:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT SEMI JOIN t2 LIMIT 10;\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT ANTI JOIN t2 LIMIT 10;\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR it do not have this limitation and also support in / not in subquery:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT SEMI JOIN t2;\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT ANTI JOIN t2;\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM v1 WHERE literal IN (SELECT id FROM t2);\r\nSELECT * FROM v1 WHERE literal NOT IN (SELECT id FROM t2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1(id int) using parquet;\r\nCREATE TABLE t2(id int, type string) using parquet;\r\nCREATE TEMP VIEW v1 AS SELECT id, 't' AS type FROM t1;\r\n\r\nEXPLAIN

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. when `ProjectExec`'s `projectList` contains `MonotonicallyIncreasingID`, add a `RangePartitioning` to the  `outputPartitioning` and append a `SortOrder(..., Ascending, ...)` at the end of `outputOrdering`;\r\n2. when the expression is **NOT** `nullable`, skip the `nullOrdering` comparison in `SortOrder.satisfies` and `RangePartitioning.satisfies0`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn _Pandas-API-on-Spark_:\r\n\r\n1. _MonotonicallyIncreasingID_ and _AttachDistributedSequence_ are used as the indexing type for distributed datasets, they naturally have **RangePartitioning** and **Ascending Ordering**.\r\n2. Sorting by index seems a common scenario, such as:\r\n\r\n- internally, _Window.orderBy(NATURAL_ORDER_COLUMN_NAME)_ is widely used in `GroupBy`, `Rolling`, `Expanding`, `ExponentialMoving`, etc;\r\n- the  _sort_index()_ maybe a high frequently used function for end users;\r\n\r\nSo we should make MonotonicallyIncreasingID and AttachDistributedSequence provide the RangePartitioning and Ascending Ordering, so that the optimization rules (such as `EnsureRequirements` and `EliminateSorts`) may leverage them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `Inline.eval` to return a row of null values rather than a null row in the case of a null input struct.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nConsider the following query:\r\n```\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false;\r\nselect inline(array(named_struct('a', 1, 'b', 2), null));\r\n```\r\nThis query fails with a `NullPointerException`:\r\n```\r\n22/06/16 15:10:06 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0)\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.GenerateExec.$anonfun$doExecute$11(GenerateExec.scala:122)\r\n```\r\n(In Spark 3.1.3, you don't need to set `spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage` to false to reproduce the error, since Spark 3.1.3 has no codegen path for `Inline`).\r\n\r\nThis query fails regardless of the setting of `spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage`:\r\n```\r\nval dfWide = (Seq((1))\r\n  .toDF(\"col0\")\r\n  .selectExpr(Seq.tabulate(99)(x => s\"$x as col${x + 1}\"): _*))\r\n\r\nval df = (dfWide\r\n  .selectExpr(\"*\", \"array(named_struct('a', 1, 'b', 2), null) as struct_array\"))\r\n\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"*\", \"inline(struct_array)\").collect\r\n```\r\nIt fails with\r\n```\r\n22/06/16 15:18:55 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0)/ 1]\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.JoinedRow.isNullAt(JoinedRow.scala:80)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.writeFields_0_8$(Unknown Source)\r\n```\r\nWhen `Inline.eval` returns a null row in the collection, GenerateExec gets a NullPointerException either when joining the null row with required child output, or projecting the null row.\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids producing the null row and produces a row of null values instead:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false;\r\nspark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\tfalse\r\nTime taken: 3.095 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\nspark-sql> select inline(array(named_struct('a', 1, 'b', 2), null));\r\n1\t2\r\nNULL\tNULL\r\nTime taken: 1.214 seconds, Fetched 2 row(s)\r\nspark-sql>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-17T19:39:26Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T18:08:43Z","closed_at":"2022-06-18T00:25:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f918614b39ad4a188c3ebd16f0b8ee7f5323608","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d5c1389321e42aa2991b8b9a01401379dd97a530","head":{"label":"bersprockets:inline_eval_null_struct_issue","ref":"inline_eval_null_struct_issue","sha":"d5c1389321e42aa2991b8b9a01401379dd97a530","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to make `equals` method invoked by No-null object to avoid NPE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince NullPointerException can possibly be thrown while calling the equals method of Object, equals should be invoked by a constant or an object that is definitely not null.\r\n\r\n> Positive example: \"test\".equals(object);\r\n> Counter example: object.equals(\"test\");\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNo need to add tests because this PR just changes object invoked.","created_at":"2022-06-17T08:42:04Z","updated_at":"2022-06-20T06:42:10Z","closed_at":"2022-06-20T00:52:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7c1fb1d63ec376202e6a96a0206ec0b215bf28c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36900/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36900/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36900/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb0ef06b641845be5774b18c9c24d67c6ab4561a","head":{"label":"dcoliversun:SPARK-39504","ref":"SPARK-39504","sha":"cb0ef06b641845be5774b18c9c24d67c6ab4561a","user":{"login":"dcoliversun","id":44011673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDExNjcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44011673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun","html_url":"https://github.com/dcoliversun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":427809934,"node_id":"R_kgDOGX_cjg","name":"spark","full_name":"dcoliversun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dcoliversun","id":44011673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDExNjcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44011673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun","html_url":"https://github.com/dcoliversun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcoliversun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dcoliversun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to propagate `java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true` in SBT tests. \r\n- This also fixes several `hive` module (which downloads Hive or Hadoop dependencies) failures.\r\n- `Maven` will be handled separately.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo test IPv6 SBT tests, we need to set consistently with the `SBT_OPTS`.\r\n- https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html\r\n\r\n**java.net.preferIPv6Addresses (default: false)**\r\n> When dealing with a host which has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and if IPv6 is available on the operating system, the default behavior is to prefer using IPv4 addresses over IPv6 ones. This is to ensure backward compatibility, for example applications that depend on the representation of an IPv4 address (e.g. 192.168.1.1). This property can be set to true to change that preference and use IPv6 addresses over IPv4 ones where possible, or system to preserve the order of the addresses as returned by the operating system.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is a test-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the GitHub Action with new test cases.\r\n\r\n1. New test case will be disabled by default or when `java.net.preferIPv6Addresses` is not `true`.\r\n\r\n2. With `java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true` in IPv6 environment, new test case will pass.\r\n```\r\n[info] SparkSubmitUtilsSuite:\r\n:: loading settings :: url =

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSometimes users forgot to add single quotes on the map key string literal, for example `map_col[a]`. In such a case, the Analyzer will throw an exception:\r\n```\r\n[MISSING_COLUMN] Column 'struct.a' does not exist. Did you mean one of the following? ...\r\n```\r\nWe can improve this message by saying that the user should append single quotes if the map key is a string literal.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[UNRESOLVED_MAP_KEY] Cannot resolve column 'a' as a map key. If the key is a string literal, please add single quotes around it. Otherwise, did you mean one of the following column(s)? ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nError message improvement\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes but trivial, an improvement on the error message of unresolved map key column\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the auto-generated documentation on pandas API support list, there are cases where the link of the function property provided in the document is not connected, so it needs to be corrected.\r\n\r\nThe current 'supported API generation' function dynamically compares the modules of `PySpark.pandas` and `pandas` to find the difference. \r\nAt this time, the inherited class is also aggregated, and the link is not generated correctly (such as `CategoricalIndex.all()` is used internally by inheriting `Index.all()`.) because it does not match the pattern of each API document.\r\n\r\nSo, I modified it in such a way that it is created by excluding methods that exist in the parent class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo link to the correct API document.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the \"Supported pandas APIs\" page has changed as below.\r\n<img width=\"992\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-16 at 7 54 05 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7010554/174196507-ea8a2577-1e2c-44cd-9564-e7dd81f5c799.png\">\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually check the links in the documents & the existing doc build should be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Support `createDataFrame` from a list of python native scalars (when schema is not provided).\r\n\r\n- Standardize error messages when the input list contains (any number of) scalars.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, DataFrame creation from a list of scalars is unsupported in PySpark, for example,\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([1, 2]).collect()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Can not infer schema for type: <class 'int'>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, Spark DataFrame Scala API supports that:\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq(1, 2).toDF().collect()\r\nres6: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([1], [2])\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo maintain API consistency, we propose to support DataFrame creation from a list of scalars. \r\n\r\nSee more [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rd20PVbVxNrLfOmDtetVRxkgJQhgAAtJp6XAAZfGQgc/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n1. `createDataFrame` from a list of scalars is supported.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([1, 2]).collect()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Can not infer schema for type: <class 'int'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([1, 2]).collect()\r\n[Row(_1=1), Row(_1=2)]       \r\n```\r\n3. Standardized error messages when the input list contains any scalars.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([1, 'x'])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Can not infer schema for type: <class 'int'>\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([1, (2,)])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Can not infer schema for type: <class 'int'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([1, 'x'])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: field _1: Can not merge type <class 'pyspark.sql.types.LongType'> and <class 'pyspark.sql.types.StringType'>\r\n\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([1, (2,)])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: field _1: Can not merge type <class 'pyspark.sql.types.LongType'> and <class 'pyspark.sql.types.StructType'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-16T21:39:06Z","updated_at":"2022-10-22T00:29:37Z","closed_at":"2022-10-22T00:29:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ecb56ddab29350e2520938e42d33f123cb092dda","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a72c9832f1f6ae8e8757c0811ba20ee9bec4cb1","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:createDataFrame_list","ref":"createDataFrame_list","sha":"7a72c9832f1f6ae8e8757c0811ba20ee9bec4cb1","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/user

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in #18406, #29980,  #31267 and #35357.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via reflection as a private variable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis makes the CI aware when instances of matrix jobs `build` and `pyspark` do actually not have any changes and there do not run any tests. Then, uploading files can be skipped as well, allowing to enable #36413.\r\n\r\nThis also makes the fact visible that tests for a matrix job are actually not run:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44700269/174037057-2060a97c-6dba-458f-9a46-6a989d82a837.png)\r\nThough the job itself is run, the test step is skipped. Before, you would have to open the test step and see no tests were run.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the whole job should be skipped. But that would require defining the module sets into the `precondition` job.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAll instances of matrix jobs `build` and `pyspark` are skipped if none of their respective modules have changes. When changes exists, all instances are run, but some instances then do not run any tests, as their sub-set of modules do not have changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested here:\r\n- Run without changes (root being removed from changes): https://github.com/G-Research/spark/actions/runs/2511343840\r\n- Run

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `iFamilyPolicy` and `ipFamilies` K8s Service feature in Spark Driver Service in order to support `IPv6`-only environment. After this PR, we can control `ipFamilyPolicy` and `ipFamilies`.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n$ kubectl get svc spark-xxx-driver-svc -oyaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Service\r\nmetadata:\r\n  ...\r\nspec:\r\n  clusterIP: None\r\n  ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack\r\n  ipFamilies:\r\n  - IPv4\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nK8s IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack Feature reached `Stable` stage at v1.23.\r\n- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/\r\n  - v1.16 [alpha]\r\n  - v1.21 [beta]\r\n  - v1.23 [stable]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to [EKS milestone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html), K8s v1.23 will be GA on August.\r\n\r\nKubernetes version | Upstream release | Amazon EKS release | Amazon EKS end of support\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\n1.20 | December 8, 2020 | May 18, 2021 | September 2022\r\n1.21 | April 8, 2021 | July 19, 2021 | February 2023\r\n1.22 | August 4, 2021 | April 4, 2022 | May 2023\r\n1.23 | December 7, 2021 | August 2022 | October 2023\r\n\r\nNote that \r\n- [EKS started IPv6 since January 2022.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-eks-launches-ipv6-support/)\r\n- [Docker Desktop supports IPv6 only on Linux.](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/)\r\n- [Minikube doesn't support IPv6 yet](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/8535) unfortunately.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the performance of `org.apache.spark.util.JsonProtocol` by replacing all uses of Json4s with uses of Jackson `JsonGenerator`. In my benchmarking so far, I have seen ~2x speedups for reading events and ~3x speedups for writing them.\r\n\r\nJsonProtocol is used by `EventLoggingListener` to emit JSON event logs capturing the firehose of SparkListener events. The history server uses `ReplayListenerBus` to parse the event logs and replay the event stream in order to rebuild and display a terminated Spark application's web UI. \r\n\r\nToday, JsonProtocol uses the Json4s library's ASTs when writing and reading JSON. This existing approach was chosen because we require fine-grained control over how the JSON is generated (so the listener events themselves can't be directly passed to an ObjectMapper). JsonProtocol needs to be backwards- and forwards-compatible so that a single history server application can display UIs from multiple versions of Spark: as a result, the code has special logic for handling fields which might be missing in event logs produced from older Spark versions.\r\n\r\nPerformance profiling revealed that JsonProtocol spends a significant proportion of its time in Json4s AST calls. Much of this overhead comes from temporary Scala collections which are allocated when constructing the ASTs or when extracting fields from them.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve performance by replacing all direct uses of Json4s with calls to Jackson's `JsonGenerator`, a low-level imperative API for generating JSON. \r\n\r\nAs a simple example, let's consider the `SparkListenerApplicationStart` event: this produces a JSON record like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"Event\":\"SparkListenerApplicationStart\",\"App Name\":\"Spark shell\",\"App ID\":\"app-20220615090229-0000\",\"Timestamp\":1655308948551,\"User\":\"joshrosen\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith Json4s, this is expressed as:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndef applicationStartToJson(applicationStart: SparkListenerApplicationStart): JValue = {\r\n    (\"Event\" -> SPARK_LISTENER_EVENT_FORMATTED_CLASS_NAMES.applicationStart) ~\r\n    (\"App Name\" -> applicationStart.appName) ~\r\n    (\"App ID\" -> applicationStart.appId.map(JString(_)).getOrElse(JNothing)) ~\r\n    (\"Timestamp\" -> applicationStart.time) ~\r\n    (\"User\" -> applicationStart.sparkUser) ~\r\n    (\"App Attempt ID\" -> applicationStart.appAttemptId.map(JString(_)).getOrElse(JNothing)) ~\r\n    (\"Driver Logs\" -> applicationStart.driverLogs.map(mapToJson).getOrElse(JNothing)) ~\r\n    (\"Driver Attributes\" -> applicationStart.driverAttributes.map(mapToJson).getOrElse(JNothing))\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith Jackson JsonGenerator, this is expressed as:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndef applicationStartToJson(\r\n      applicationStart: SparkListenerApplicationStart,\r\n      g: JsonGenerator): Unit = {\r\n    g.writeStartObject()\r\n    g.writeStringField(\"Event\", SPARK_LISTENER_EVENT_FORMATTED_CLASS_NAMES.applicationStart)\r\n    g.writeStringField(\"App Name\", applicationStart.appName)\r\n    applicationStart.appId.foreach(g.writeStringField(\"App ID\", _))\r\n    g.writeNumberField(\"Timestamp\", applicationStart.time)\r\n    g.writeStringField(\"User\", applicationStart.sparkUser)\r\n    applicationStart.appAttemptId.foreach(g.writeStringField(\"App Attempt ID\", _))\r\n    applicationStart.driverLogs.foreach(writeMapField(\"Driver Logs\", _, g))\r\n    applicationStart.driverAttributes.foreach(writeMapField(\"Driver Attributes\", _, g))\r\n    g.writeEndObject()\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe JsonGenerator code is more verbose but is significantly faster. This example is a relatively straightforward conversion, but there's a bit of trickiness in more complex cases (such as serialization of task metrics or resource profiles). I will leave comments in the GitHub PR review to highlight some of the less straightforward cases. \r\n\r\nThis is a big PR, but most of the changes were made in a semi-automated fashion with regex find-replace macros.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproving JsonProtocol performance has several benefits:\r\n\r\n- Decreased history server load times, especially for long-running Spark applications.\r\n- Improved EventLoggingListener throughput: this reduces the likelihood that the will fall behind and drop events (which can lead to confusing and inconsistent Spark UIs).\r\n- Reduced resource consumption on the driver, which may improve the throughput of task scheduling.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this is a stepping-stone towards eventually being able to remove our Json4s dependency:\r\n\r\n- Today Spark uses Json4s 3.x and this causes library conflicts for end users who want to upgrade to 4.x; see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33630 for one example.\r\n- To _completely_ remove Json4s we'll need to update several other parts of Spark (including code used for ML model serialization); this PR is just a first step towards that goal if we decide to pursue it.\r\n- In this PR, I continue to use Json4s in test code; I think it's fine to keep Json4s as a test-only dependency.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n### Correctness\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects to consider:\r\n\r\n- Ability for old HistoryServer versions to read new logs: I performed tests using randomly-generated events and confirmed that the old and new implementations produce JSON output that is character-for-character identical: see a [review comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36885#issuecomment-1167855113) for full details.\r\n- Ability to read event logs produced by old Spark versions: I believe this is covered by backwards-compatibility tests in `JsonProtocolSuite`, `SQLJsonProtocolSuite`, and `HistoryServerSuite`. I looked through the git history of `JsonProtocol` and found a few cases where PRs that modified it did not add compatibility tests: for each of these cases, I added new test cases in `JsonProtocolSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nSo far, I have only measured performance via laptop microbenchmarks.\r\n\r\nTo measure event parsing performance, I generated a large event log by running `(1 to 5).foreach(_ => spark.range(1, 100 * 1000, 1, 100 * 1000).foreach(_ => ()))` then used the history server's logs to measure the time taken to load the UI. This PR's improvements cut the loading time from ~34 seconds to ~18 seconds.\r\n\r\nTo measure event logging overheads, I used YourKit asynchronous CPU profiling to to measure `spark.range(1, 100 * 1000, 1, 100 * 1000).foreach(_ => ())`. For this benchmark, this PR's changes cut total time in `logEvent` (including callees) from ~9.5 seconds to ~2.9 seconds.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-16T02:35:02Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T21:10:08Z","closed_at":"2022-07-03T20:50:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"341eeb3ca626ddabbadc6a228ccb926a0ffc8f11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds hive resource URL of origLoader, the existing classloader, to the newly created classloader of IsolatedClientLoader.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars\" is set to \"path\", IsolatedClientLoader can refer to jars corresponding to a specific hive metastore version with viewfs or hdfs schema.\r\nAt this time, there is no problem when the deploy-mode is client, but in the case of cluster, the reference to the xml files related to the hive setting disappears, and then an error occurs in the process of initializing HiveConf in HiveClientImpl.\r\nThe xml configuration files related to hive are set to \"spark.yarn.dist.files\". At this time, these files, such as hive-site.xml, are saved as local files in the local usercache of the YARN Nodemanager host. The problem is solved by storing the URL pointing to the location of these resources and adding it to the list of resources loaded by the newly created IsolatedClientLoader.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* test by unit test\r\n* I tested a sample spark application on a cluster with the build version of this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-16T00:56:42Z","updated_at":"2022-10-04T00:31:24Z","closed_at":"2022-10-04T00:31:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f099e6bf7d3dcdca04ae3ffddb3406ec7988814","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36884/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36884/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36884/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a07d564b8c851e7747f6a631f68751a266039aa8","head":{"label":"koodin9:SPARK-39485","ref":"SPARK-39485","sha":"a07d564b8c851e7747f6a631f68751a266039aa8","user":{"login":"koodin9","id":14210027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjEwMDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14210027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9","html_url":"https://github.com/koodin9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503956726,"node_id":"R_kgDOHgnE9g","name":"spark","full_name":"koodin9/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"koodin9","id":14210027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjEwMDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14210027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9","html_url":"https://github.com/koodin9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koodin9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/koodin9/spark","description":"Apache

struct will have non-nullable fields, even if the array itself has a null entry (as in the example above). As a result, the output attributes for the generator will be non-nullable.\r\n\r\nWhen the output attributes for `Inline` are non-nullable, `GenerateUnsafeProjection#writeExpressionsToBuffer` generates incorrect code for null structs.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, the issue is this: `GenerateExec#codeGenCollection` generates code that will check if the struct instance (i.e., array element) is null and, if so, set a boolean for each struct field to indicate that the field contains a null. However, unless the generator's output attributes are nullable, `GenerateUnsafeProjection#writeExpressionsToBuffer` will not generate any code to check those booleans. Instead it will generate code to write out whatever is in the variables that normally hold the struct values (which will be garbage if the array element is null).\r\n\r\nArrays of structs from file sources do not have this issue. In that case, each `StructField` will have nullable=true due to [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fe85d7912f86c3e337aa93b23bfa7e7e01c0a32e/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSource.scala#L417).\r\n\r\n(Note: the eval path for `Inline` has a different bug with null array elements that occurs even when `nullable` is set correctly in the schema, but I will address that in a separate PR).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a V2 write uses an input with a struct type which contains differences in the casing of field names, the `caseSensitive` config is not being honored, always doing a strict case sensitive comparison.\r\n \r\nThis PR adds the resolver to the private method `DataType#equalsIgnoreCompatibleNullabilityWithNameResolution`, renamed from `DataType#equalsIgnoreCompatibleNullability` and uses that resolver to perform the field name comparison. The `config.resolver` is passed in the invocation via `V2WriteCommand.outputResolved`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI think the same case sensitivity configuration should be honored for field names, therefore this would be a bug.\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE tmp.test_table_to (key int, object struct<shardId:int>) USING ICEBERG;\r\nCREATE TABLE tmp.test_table_from (key int, object struct<shardid:int>) USING HIVE;\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE tmp.test_table_to SELECT 1 as key, object FROM tmp.test_table_from;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above results in Exception:\r\n```\r\nError in query: unresolved operator 'OverwriteByExpression RelationV2[key#3, object#4] spark_catalog.tmp.test_table_to, true, false;\r\n'OverwriteByExpression RelationV2[key#3, object#4] spark_catalog.tmp.test_table_to, true, false\r\n+- Project [1 AS key#0, object#2]\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.tmp.test_table_from\r\n      +- HiveTableRelation [`tmp`.`test_table_from`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe, Data Cols: [key#1, object#2], Partition Cols: []]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, previously failing v2 write queries with mismatching casing in struct field names, now would respect the `caseSensitive` config, and if `caseSensitive = false` these queries would now work, as compared to before when they would always fail regardless of the `caseSensitive` config value.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Added unit test\r\n- Tested manually in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRefactor DEFAULT column support to skip passing the main `Analyzer` around. Instead, the `ResolvedDefaultColumnsUtil.scala` file gains the method `getDefaultColumnAnalyzer` which constructs a separate `Analyzer` containing only built-in functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis cleans up the code by reducing state passed to different methods and classes. The idea came from code review in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36771.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it is a refactoring-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDEFAULT column support is covered by existing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove \"Number of queries\" info from the golden files of SQLQueryTestSuite\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAt the beginning of each golden file, there is one line with the text \"Number of queries...\". I suggest removing it for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- The text is actually useless, SQLQueryTestSuite compares the number of queries by splitting the input file with  `-- !query`.\r\n- It causes code conflicts on backporting fixes to released branches.\r\n- It causes code conflict on the open PRs if there are other merged PRs that update the same golden files. I made this PR in 15 minutes, and Github shows that the PR conflicts with newly merged PRs already.\r\n<img width=\"929\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 10 53 41 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/173753804-c82c47bf-ebd2-4698-bfe2-fa9ad6e1636a.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCast from Integer to Float or from Long to Double/Float may loss precision if the length of Integer/Long beyonds the **significant digits** of a Double(which is 15 or 16 digits) or Float(which is 7 or 8 digits).\r\n\r\nFor example, ```select *, cast(a as int) from (select cast(33554435 as foat) a )``` gives `33554436` instead of `33554435`.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes the optimization rule `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison`, it may result in incorrect (confused) result .\r\nWe can reproduce it with following script.\r\n```\r\nspark.range(10).map(i => 64707595868612313L).createOrReplaceTempView(\"tbl\")\r\nval df = sql(\"select * from tbl where cast(value as double) = cast('64707595868612313' as double)\")\r\ndf.explain(true)\r\ndf.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith we disable this optimization rule , it returns 10 records.\r\nBut if we enable this optimization rule, it returns empty, since the sql is optimized to\r\n```\r\nselect * from tbl where value = 64707595868612312L\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the behavior that may confuse users (or maybe a bug?)\r\n\r\n### Does

this PR, the DriverRunner has been enhanced to use the same rolling policy as ExecutorRunner.\r\nThere are two opions for this enhancement:\r\n1. use the same configuration as executor\r\n2. create a new set of configuration prefixed by spark.driver.logs.rolling\r\nTo minimize the configurations and, the PR chooses 1. \r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe DriverRunner will now use the following configuration to roll the stdout and stderr logs\r\n```\r\nspark.executor.logs.rolling.maxRetainedFiles\r\nspark.executor.logs.rolling.enableCompression\r\nspark.executor.logs.rolling.maxSize\r\nspark.executor.logs.rolling.strategy\r\nspark.executor.logs.rolling.time.interval\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe log file (stdout/stderr) of driver in cluster mode on Spark standalone cluster will never get cleaned and will use all the disk space\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIf user doesn't set \"spark.executor.logs.rolling.*\" on spark worker, there is no impaction, if user did specify those settings, then the driver's stdout/stderr will be rolling, user may not see the full log as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nHard to add unit test since we need a complete

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. Add a new `inferDate` option to CSV Options. The description is:\r\n> Whether or not to infer columns that satisfy the `dateFormat` option as `Date`. Requires `inferSchema` to be true. When `false`, columns with dates will be inferred as `String` (or as `Timestamp` if it fits the `timestampFormat`) Legacy date formats in `Timestamp` columns cannot be parsed with this option.\r\n\r\nAn error will be thrown if `inferDate` is true when SQL Configuration LegacyTimeParserPolicy is `LEGACY`. This is to avoid incorrect schema inferences from legacy time parsers not doing strict parsing.\r\n\r\nThe `inferDate` option should prevent performance degradation for users who don't opt-in.\r\n\r\n2. Modify InferField in CSVInferSchema.scala to include Date type.\r\n\r\nIf `typeSoFar` in `inferField` is Date, Timestamp or TimstampNTZ, we will first attempt to parse Date and then parse Timestamp/TimestampNTZ. The reason why we attempt to parse date for `typeSoFar`=Timestamp/TimestampNTZ is because of the case where a column contains a timestamp entry and then a date entry - we should detect both of the data types and infer the column as a timestamp type.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nSeq(\"2010|10|10\", \"2010_10_10\")\r\n  .toDF.repartition(1).write.mode(\"overwrite\").text(\"/tmp/foo\")\r\nspark.read\r\n  .option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\")\r\n  .option(\"header\", \"false\")\r\n  .option(\"dateFormat\", \"yyyy|MM|dd\")\r\n  .option(\"timestampFormat\", \"yyyy_MM_dd\").csv(\"/tmp/foo\").printSchema()\r\n```\r\nResult:\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- _c0: timestamp (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Also modified `makeConverter` in `UnivocityParser` to handle Date type entries in a timestamp type column to properly parse the above example.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new behavior of schema inference when `inferDate = true`:\r\n1. If a column contains only dates, it should be of “date” type in the inferred schema\r\n--> If the date format and the timestamp format are identical (e.g. both are yyyy/mm/dd), entries will default to being interpreted as Date\r\n3. If a column contains dates and timestamps, it should be of “timestamp” type in the inferred schema\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to `CSVInferSchemaSuite` and `UnivocityParserSuite`. An end to end test is added to `CSVSuite`\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks:\r\n\r\n`inferDate` increases parsing/inference time in general. The impact scales with the number of rows (and not the number of columns). For columns of date type (which would be inferred as timestamp when `inferDate=false`), inference and parsing takes 30% longer. The performance impact is much greater on columns of timestamp type (taking 30x longer than `inferDate=false`) - due to trying each timestamp as a date (and throwing an error) during the inference step.\r\n\r\n#### Number of seconds taken to parse each CSV file with `inferDate true` and `inferDate false`\r\n\r\n|                                             | inferDate=False | inferDate=True | master branch |\r\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|\r\n| Small file (<100 row/col). Mixed data types | 0.32            | 0.33           |                |\r\n| 100K rows. 4 columns. Mixed data types.     | 0.70            | 2.80           | 0.70          |\r\n| 20k columns. 4 rows. Mixed Data types.      | 16.32           | 15.90          | 13.5           |\r\n| Large file. Only date type.                 | 2.15            | 3.70           | 2.10          |\r\n| Large file.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n Construct the schema from `np.dtype` when `createDataFrame` from a NumPy array, when Arrow execution is diabled, that is, the Spark config `spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled` is `false`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, NumPy arrays of `\"int8\", \"int16\", \"int32\", \"float32\"` dtypes are supported in this PR. \r\n\r\nNon-goals:\r\n- More NumPy dtypes should be supported in follow-up PRs. \r\n- To enable pandas DataFrame to accept `\"int8\", \"int16\", \"int32\", \"float32\"` dtypes will be a follow-up PR, since it may be considered a breaking change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs part of [SPARK-39405](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39405) for NumPy support in SQL.\r\n\r\nWhen Arrow execution is disabled, `createDataFrame` from a NumPy array only accepts numeric dtypes `int64` and `float64`.\r\n\r\nWe may resolve the issue by\r\n- convert numeric dtypes of the input NumPy array to respective Spark types\r\n- construct the schema accordingly\r\n\r\nThat approach also saves us from inferring the schema.\r\n\r\n**Note:** \r\nWhen Arrow execution is enabled, conversion from NumPy dtypes to Spark types is implemented already [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/sql/pandas/types.py), that works as below:\r\n<img width=\"882\" alt=\"image\"

execution is disabled to be the same as those when Arrow execution is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Now users can `createDataFrame` from NumPy arrays of `\"int8\", \"int16\", \"int32\", \"float32\"` dtypes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to extend the `IPv6` support in `RpcAddress` additionally when the input doesn't have `[]` properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNote that Apache Spark already depends on `java.net.URI` `getHost` and `getPort` and it assumpts `[]`-style IPv6. This PR additionally handles the case where the given host string doesn't have `[]`.\r\n- `RpcAddress.fromURIString`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/683179c6813dbdccebd4063c3aac520020765692/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rpc/RpcAddress.scala#L40-L43\r\n\r\n- `Utils.extractHostPortFromSparkUrl`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/683179c6813dbdccebd4063c3aac520020765692/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/Utils.scala#L2520-L2524\r\n\r\nWe need to handle Java URI IPv6 style additionally.\r\n```\r\njshell> var uri = new java.net.URI(\"https://[::1]:80\")\r\nuri ==> https://[::1]:80\r\n\r\njshell> uri.getHost()\r\n$4 ==> \"[::1]\"\r\n\r\njshell> uri.getPort()\r\n$5 ==> 80\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is `private[spark]` class.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added test cases.\r\n\r\nThis is also tested manually on IPv6-only environment with the following command.\r\n```\r\n$ SERIAL_SBT_TESTS=1 SPARK_LOCAL_HOSTNAME='[2600:.(omitted)..:60cd]'

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use UUID instead of a fixed test database location in `JavaJdbcRDDSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough there exists a clean-up logic in `JavaJdbcRDDSuite`, the location is not removed cleanly when the tests are interrupted. After this PR, we can avoid the conflicts due to the leftover.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPull out data type matching from `eval`. So we do not need  to match data type for every row.  Here is the change list:\r\n- UnaryMinus\r\n- Add\r\n- Subtract\r\n- Multiply\r\n- BitwiseCount\r\n- Floor\r\n- Ceil\r\n- RoundBase\r\n- Hex\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSome expressions do data type matching inside `eval` but it is not friendly for performance. Which is a overhead for every execution per row.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only improve performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn `PlanStabilitySuite`, we normalize expression IDs by matching `#\\d+` in the explain string. However, this regex can match plan id in `Exchange` node as well, which will mess up the normalization if expression IDs and plan IDs overlap.\r\n\r\nThis PR normalizes plan id separately in `PlanStabilitySuite`.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake the plan golden file more stable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nbackport

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ConstantPropagation` currently only supports replace constants in equality predicates. For example: `i = 5 AND j = i + 3` -> `i = 5 AND j = 8`. \r\nThis PR enhances `ConstantPropagation` to  replace constants in inequality predicates. For example: `i = 5 AND j > i + 3` -> `i = 5 AND j > 8`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSimplify filter condition to improve query performance.
