Beam SQL tests of intersect, union, and set difference use a DOUBLE field for a price. This is a bad practice. It also happened to interact badly with a fix to `RowCoder` to make it consistent with `DoubleCoder` in #6772.\r\n\r\nThis PR just fixes the tests. The ultimate question of \"what should be the spec?\" remains unresolved but it is clear from the examples online that whatever the SQL standard says, equality on floating point numbers is not reasonable to support in an abstract library like ours.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

a crash in Beam codebase reported by TFX team that happens when a pipeline operates with functions that take keyword-only arguments (a language feature that became available in Python 3). This PR is a first step to support kwonlyargs, there are a few other places in Beam codebase captured in TODOs where additional work may be needed. We will also need to add (Python 3-only) tests  where dofns/sideinputs have kwonlyargs once Python 3 test suite is in a reasonably-good shape.\r\n1. Use `getfullargspec` instead of `getargspec` on Python 3, which recognizes kwonlyargs\r\n2. Avoid an irreverisble monkey-patch of `inspect.getargspec.` ([BEAM-5490]) \r\n3. Recognize functions with kwonlyargs in sideinputs.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

stageContext are not properly closed. The StageContext (by default an instance of `ReferenceCountingFlinkExecutableStageContextFactory.WrappedContext`) is responsible for tracking usage of the sdk harness processes. If this isn't closed for a stage, the reference count will never get to 0 and the harness process will never be killed.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the ExecutableStageDoFnOperator dispose() logic will always be called regardless of whether `super.dispose()` fails. This PR just ensures that things are cleaned up properly. We should also investigate this particular error (tracked in BEAM-5816).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

PR introduces an initial implementation of conversions from AVRO `GenericRecord` to `Row`. Transformation doesn't allow any type widening or narrowing. The idea is to build narrowing and widening as a separate transformation using `Row` and keep this code simple.\r\n\r\nThere are further steps, that I want to put into separate pull requests:\r\n- change reading in `BigQueryTableProvider` to newer implementation\r\n- the opposite, `Row` to `GenericRecord`, and test that roundtrip preserves equality\r\n- add transforms for projecting fields, type widening and narrowing\r\n- add a builder to `AvroIO`\r\n- add `AvroTableProvider` for SQL\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Updated counters\r\nto correctly reflect this, which is important for tracking the rate of buffer\r\nconsumption by runners\r\n\r\nAlso, some runners (e.g. the Dataflow harness) don't set unique names on\r\nPTransforms, which was causing counters to be conflated.

edge case has been discovered in an in development Dataflow runner harness that prevents the urn from being populated correctly. \r\nThis is in part due to the legacy representation Dataflow currently uses as it transitions to directly support portable pipelines for job submission (BEAM-2885). This relaxation is the smallest surface that avoids breaking the Go or other SDKs on current Dataflow runners, and the in progress runner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

commit resolves 23 errors and 1 failure in the io package (Py3). The solutions to these errors are well-documented, and relate to for example the widespread bytes-str issues, as well as the deprecation of assertItemsEqual in favor of assertCountEqual.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of PRs with the goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented [here](https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3).\r\n\r\n@tvalentyn @Fematich @charlesccychen @aaltay @Juta @manuzhang\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

this pr load-tests and Nexmark suites were gathered together in a \"testing\" directory. Special \"test-utils\" module was divided to store common code for those two (and possibly other tests, such as IOITs). \r\n\r\nFor now, only MetricsReader class was extracted to the common module to diminish reviewer - contributor feedback loop. In the future, most of the metrics related and publishing metrics related code (eg. to BigQuery) could be moved to the common module. Nexmark is the most advanced in those areas so other tests should benefit from that. \r\n\r\nI added an extra commit that uses the common metrics class in load tests. let me know if this should be moved from this pr. \r\n\r\n💡  Friendly hint - it might be easier to review commit by commit.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

`StorageLevel` is the preferred mechanism to decide what is serialized when and where. With this change, Beam respects Spark's wish to keep data deserialized in memory, even if the storage level *may* swap to disk (e.g. MEMORY_AND_DISK).\r\n\r\nThis PR also drive-by fixes using the `MEMORY_ONLY_2` storage level. The code previously assumed that no serialization was necessary, which isn't strictly true since the `_2` means \"replicate to other nodes\" - i.e. serialize over network.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

described in [BEAM-5759](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5759), a ConcurrentModificationException can be thrown when JmsIO source checkpoint finalisation occurs simultaneously to further messages being added for finalisation. This is due to the state of JmsCheckpointMark not being thread safe.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a unit test which demonstrates the issue by\r\n\r\n1. Adding several messages to a queue.\r\n1. Reading some of these messages with an UnboundedJmsReader (which adds messages for finalization).\r\n1. Calling finalizeCheckpoint on the reader's checkpoint mark in a separate thread.\r\n1. Reading the remainder of the messages in parallel with the above finalization.\r\n\r\nIn order to reliably reproduce this issue, the test uses a JMS consumer which decorates received messages with a callback which sleeps for a short period, introducing some \"lag\" into the finalization process.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, JmsCheckpointMark has been updated with thread safety constructs. In order to avoid potentially long blocks for consumers during checkpoint finalization, a read/write lock is used and finalization takes a snapshot of state before processing in a lock-free manner, only locking to update state post-finalization.\r\n\r\n@jbonofre \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
