an option to the JDBC data source to initialize the environment of the remote database session\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis proposes an option to the JDBC datasource, tentatively called \" sessionInitStatement\" to implement the functionality of session initialization present for example in the Sqoop connector for Oracle (see https://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.4.6/SqoopUserGuide.html#_oraoop_oracle_session_initialization_statements ) . After each database session is opened to the remote DB, and before starting to read data, this option executes a custom SQL statement (or a PL/SQL block in the case of Oracle).\r\n\r\nSee also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21519 \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested using Spark SQL data source and Oracle

I looked through the pyspark folder installed by pip and the pre-built package from download and found the file structures are a bit different, which should be the cause for the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids to reuse unpersistent dataset among test cases by making dataset unpersistent at the end of each test case.\r\n\r\nIn `DatasetCacheSuite`, the test case `\"get storage level\"` does not make dataset unpersisit after make the dataset persisitent. The same dataset will be made persistent by the test case `\"persist and then rebind right encoder when join 2 datasets\"` Thus, we run these test cases, the second case does not perform to make dataset persistent. This is because in \r\n\r\nWhen we run only the second case, it performs to make dataset persistent. It is not good to change behavior of the second test suite. The first test case should correctly make dataset unpersistent.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTesting started at 17:52 ...\r\n01:52:15.053 WARN org.apache.hadoop.util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, when using Spark, the beginners do not realize our persist API is lazy. They do not know what is the most efficient way to materialize it. Sometimes, they just use collect(), which is very expensive when the data set is big. This PR is to add a simple API to enable users to do eager persist. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we also need another Dataset API to verify whether the Dataset has been cached and materialized.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded two test cases and simplify the existing test cases by using the newly added API.","created_at":"2017-07-23T04:26:08Z","updated_at":"2019-11-10T18:30:34Z","closed_at":"2019-11-10T18:30:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6278ab7679ec2771bcec90b5ddd291b85163b832","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/31bf79742a219ca13cca2a6774da783b061864d1","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:eagerPersist","ref":"eagerPersist","sha":"31bf79742a219ca13cca2a6774da783b061864d1","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch removes the `****` string from test names in FlatMapGroupsWithStateSuite. `***` is a common string developers grep for when using Scala

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFeature of adaptive query execution is a good way to avoid generating too many small files on HDFS, like mentioned in SPARK-16188.\r\nWhen feature of adaptive query execution is enabled, all shuffles will be coordinated. The drawbacks:\r\n1. It's hard to balance the num of reducers(this decides the processing speed) and file size on HDFS;\r\n2. It generates some more shuffles(https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/EnsureRequirements.scala#L101);\r\n3. It generates lots of jobs, which have extra cost for scheduling.\r\n\r\nWe can add a config and enable adaptive query execution only for the last shuffle.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.","created_at":"2017-07-22T14:42:38Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T15:15:10Z","closed_at":"2017-07-27T08:07:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19990ff7a28332fc2ef3b87195b5fc766dbcda46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18713/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18713/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18713/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/efb8cd36de0e0b96a8efe855b6243c1f553ce195","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-21509","ref":"SPARK-21509","sha":"efb8cd36de0e0b96a8efe855b6243c1f553ce195","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe --packages option jars are getting added to the classpath with the scheme as \"file:///\", in Unix it doesn't have problem with this since the scheme contains the Unix Path separator which separates the jar name with location in the classpath. In Windows, the jar file is not getting resolved from the classpath because of the scheme.\r\n\r\nWindows : file:///C:/Users/<user>/.ivy2/jars/<jar-name>.jar\r\nUnix : file:///home/<user>/.ivy2/jars/<jar-name>.jar\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we are avoiding the 'file://' scheme to get added to the packages jar files.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have verified manually in Windows and Unix environments, with the change it adds the jar to classpath like below,\r\n\r\nWindows : C:\\Users\\<user>\\.ivy2\\jars\\<jar-name>.jar\r\nUnix :

was some code based on the old SASL handler in the new auth client that\r\nwas incorrectly using the SASL user as the user to authenticate against the\r\nexternal shuffle service. This caused the external service to not be able to\r\nfind the correct secret to authenticate the connection, failing the connection.\r\n\r\nIn the course of debugging, I found that some log messages from the YARN shuffle\r\nservice were a little noisy, so I silenced some of them, and also added a couple\r\nof new ones that helped find this issue. On top of that, I found that a check\r\nin the code that records app secrets was wrong, causing more log spam and also\r\nusing an O(n) operation instead of an O(1) call.\r\n\r\nAlso added a new integration suite for the YARN shuffle service with auth on,\r\nand verified it failed before, and passes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith supervise enabled for a driver, re-launching it was failing because the driver had the same framework Id. This patch creates a new driver framework id every time we re-launch a driver, but we keep the driver submission id the same since that is the same with the task id the driver was launched with on mesos and retry state and other info within Dispatcher's data structures uses that as a key.\r\nWe append a \"-retry-%4d\" string as a suffix to the framework id passed by the dispatcher to the driver and the same value to the app_id created by each driver, except the first time where we dont need the retry suffix.\r\nThe previous format for the frameworkId was   'DispactherFId-DriverSubmissionId'.\r\n\r\nWe also detect the case where we have multiple spark contexts started from within the same driver and we do set proper names to their corresponding app-ids. The old practice was to unset the framework id passed from the dispatcher after the driver framework was started for the first time and let mesos decide the framework ID for subsequent spark contexts. The decided fId was passed as an appID.\r\nThis patch affects heavily the history server. Btw we dont have the issues of the standalone case where driver id must be different since the dispatcher will re-launch a driver(mesos task) only if it gets an update that it is dead and this is verified by mesos implicitly. We also dont fix the fine grained mode which is deprecated and of no use.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis task was manually tested on dc/os. Launched a driver, stoped its container and verified the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nInitial retry of the driver, driver in pending state:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/28473862-1088b736-6e4f-11e7-8d7d-7b785b1da6a6.png)\r\n\r\nDriver

This batch decompress does not use `InternalRow` to reduce the number of memory accesses.\r\n\r\nAs first step of this implementation, this JIRA supports primitive data types.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis generates a documentation for Spark SQL built-in functions.\r\n\r\nOne drawback is, this requires a proper build to generate built-in function list.\r\nOnce it is built, it only takes few seconds by `sql/create-docs.sh`.\r\n\r\nPlease see https://spark-test.github.io/sparksqldoc/ that I hosted to show the output documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few more works to be done in order to make the documentation pretty, for example, separating `Arguments:` and `Examples:` but I guess this should be done within `ExpressionDescription` and `ExpressionInfo` rather than manually parsing it. I will fix these in a follow up.\r\n\r\nThis requires `pip install mkdocs` to generate HTMLs from markdown files.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd docs\r\njekyll build\r\n```\r\n,\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd docs\r\njekyll serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd sql\r\ncreate-docs.sh\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-21T09:19:33Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:41:35Z","closed_at":"2017-07-26T16:41:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3d21e20c000ca23b4d6ec01604888abd4526e9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c711ff5363a0608c11b97c915bfc8b8cdbf2ba95","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-21485","ref":"SPARK-21485","sha":"c711ff5363a0608c11b97c915bfc8b8cdbf2ba95","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn some complex queries where the same table is joined multiple times interleaved with aggregation we can get conflicting attributes that leak via partitionings leading to wrong results because shuffles are not inserted. See `JoinSuite` diff for example. This patch adds a method to `Partitioning` that restricts it to a given set of output attributes. This method is then called by operators that generally maintain their input distribution but output only a subset of the inputs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test based on example code from JIRA and additional unit testing of new method.","created_at":"2017-07-21T05:12:19Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:55Z","closed_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0246ce8aca0565bb678277a6e3fffac4626894e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18697/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18697/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18697/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f21237b61a59bfcbf384866e06323a667154924","head":{"label":"aray:SPARK-16683","ref":"SPARK-16683","sha":"0f21237b61a59bfcbf384866e06323a667154924","user":{"login":"aray","id":981982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTk4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray","html_url":"https://github.com/aray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35430088,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQzMDA4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"aray/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aray","id":981982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTk4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/981982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray","html_url":"https://github.com/aray","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aray/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aray/spark","description":"Mirror

code was failing to account for some cases when setting up log\r\nredirection. For example, if a user redirected only stdout to a file,\r\nthe launcher code would leave stderr without redirection, which could\r\nlead to child processes getting stuck because stderr wasn't being\r\nread.\r\n\r\nSo detect cases where only one of the streams is redirected, and\r\nredirect the other stream to the log as appropriate.\r\n\r\nFor the old \"launch()\" API, redirection of the unconfigured stream\r\nonly happens if the user has explicitly requested for log redirection.\r\nLog redirection is on by default with \"startApplication()\".\r\n\r\nMost of the change is actually adding new unit tests to make sure the\r\ndifferent cases work as expected. As part of that, I moved some tests\r\nthat were in the core/ module to the launcher/ module instead, since\r\nthey don't depend on spark-submit.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-20T21:56:15Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T19:07:23Z","closed_at":"2017-08-02T19:07:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32645f459f34c52337ae51b251d097396a1b2b6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18696/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18696/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18696/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/39ca992ba91569adda3429b4e6f71f879e4d9d9d","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-21490","ref":"SPARK-21490","sha":"39ca992ba91569adda3429b4e6f71f879e4d9d9d","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using PySpark broadcast variables in a multi-threaded environment,  `SparkContext._pickled_broadcast_vars` becomes a shared resource.  A race condition can occur when broadcast variables that are pickled from one thread get added to the shared ` _pickled_broadcast_vars` and become part of the python command from another thread.  This PR introduces a thread-safe pickled registry using thread local storage so that when python command is pickled (causing the broadcast variable to be pickled and added to the registry) each thread will have their own view of the pickle registry to retrieve and clear the broadcast variables used.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test that causes this race condition using another thread.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-20T21:52:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-02T07:40:00Z","closed_at":"2017-08-01T22:15:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01a20c3b442b7ad0fe14419d4437686c24b4f2e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18695/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18695/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18695/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d4d1fed3979209412070a964fa9951043f5a58bd","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:pyspark-bcast-threadsafe-SPARK-12717","ref":"pyspark-bcast-threadsafe-SPARK-12717","sha":"d4d1fed3979209412070a964fa9951043f5a58bd","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optimization rule that infers join conditions using propagated constraints.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if there is a join, where the left relation has 'a = 1' and the right relation has 'b = 1', then the rule infers 'a = b' as a join predicate. Only semantically new predicates are appended to the existing join condition.\r\n\r\nRefer to the corresponding ticket and tests for more details.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch comes with a new test suite to cover the implemented logic.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-20T20:32:47Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T14:45:56Z","closed_at":"2017-11-30T22:28:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a90c78b8e5144372e1085f9c218241f6d326bbd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ab91a19cefd63b7d28674992b68da8164d487ae","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-21417","ref":"spark-21417","sha":"9ab91a19cefd63b7d28674992b68da8164d487ae","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

configurations with external shuffle enabled, we have observed that if a very large no. of blocks are being fetched from a remote host, it puts the NM under extra pressure and can crash it. This change introduces a configuration `spark.reducer.maxBlocksInFlightPerAddress` , to limit the no. of map outputs being fetched from a given remote address. The changes applied here are applicable for both the scenarios - when external shuffle is enabled as well as disabled.\r\n\r\nRan the job with the default configuration which does not change the existing behavior and ran it with few configurations of lower values -10,20,50,100.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter the call of persist/unpersis, the query plans of a `Dataset` should be changed accordingly. But currently the query plans are the same. So you will see the inconsistent query plans like:\r\n\r\n    scala> val x1 = Seq(1).toDF()\r\n    x1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [value: int]\r\n    scala> println(x1.queryExecution.executedPlan) // query plans are materialized before persist()\r\n    LocalTableScan [value#1]\r\n    scala> x1.persist()\r\n    scala> x1.count()\r\n    scala> println(x1.queryExecution.executedPlan)\r\n    LocalTableScan [value#1]\r\n\r\n    scala> val x1 = Seq(1).toDF()\r\n    x1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [value: int]\r\n    scala> x1.persist()\r\n    scala> x1.count()\r\n    scala> println(x1.queryExecution.executedPlan) // query plans are materialized after persist()\r\n    InMemoryTableScan [value#24]\r\n       +- InMemoryRelation [value#24], true, 10000, StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n             +- LocalTableScan [value#1]\r\n    scala> x1.unpersist()\r\n    scala> println(x1.queryExecution.executedPlan)\r\n    InMemoryTableScan [value#24]\r\n       +- InMemoryRelation [value#24], true, 10000, StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n             +- LocalTableScan [value#1]\r\n\r\nAfter this fix:\r\n\r\n    scala> val x1 = Seq(1).toDF()\r\n    x1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [value: int]\r\n    scala> println(x1.queryExecution.executedPlan)\r\n    LocalTableScan [value#1]\r\n    scala> x1.persist()\r\n    scala> x1.count()\r\n    scala> println(x1.queryExecution.executedPlan)\r\n    InMemoryTableScan [value#1]\r\n       +- InMemoryRelation [value#1], true, 10000, StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n             +- LocalTableScan [value#1]\r\n    scala> x1.unpersist()\r\n    scala> println(x1.queryExecution.executedPlan)\r\n    LocalTableScan [value#1]\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJava's `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` overrides finalize(), even this file input/output stream is closed correctly and promptly, it will still leave some memory footprints which will only get cleaned in Full GC. This will introduce two side effects:\r\n\r\n1. Lots of memory footprints regarding to Finalizer will be kept in memory and this will increase the memory overhead. In our use case of external shuffle service, a busy shuffle service will have bunch of this object and potentially lead to OOM.\r\n2. The Finalizer will only be called in Full GC, and this will increase the overhead of Full GC and lead to long GC pause.\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8080225\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cloudbees.com/blog/fileinputstream-fileoutputstream-considered-harmful\r\n\r\nSo to fix this potential issue, here

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-12661, I guess we officially dropped Python 2.6 support. It looks there are few places missing this notes.\r\n\r\nI grepped \"Python 2.6\" and \"python 2.6\" and the results were below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/api/python/SerDeUtil.scala:  // Unpickle array.array generated by Python 2.6\r\n./docs/index.md:Note that support for Java 7, Python 2.6 and old Hadoop versions before 2.6.5 were removed as of Spark 2.2.0.\r\n./docs/rdd-programming-guide.md:Spark {{site.SPARK_VERSION}} works with Python 2.6+ or Python 3.4+. It can use the standard CPython interpreter,\r\n./docs/rdd-programming-guide.md:Note that support for Python 2.6 is deprecated as of Spark 2.0.0, and may be removed in Spark 2.2.0.\r\n./python/pyspark/context.py:            warnings.warn(\"Support for Python 2.6 is deprecated as of Spark 2.0.0\")\r\n./python/pyspark/ml/tests.py:        sys.stderr.write('Please install unittest2 to test with Python 2.6 or earlier')\r\n./python/pyspark/mllib/tests.py:        sys.stderr.write('Please install unittest2 to test with Python 2.6 or earlier')\r\n./python/pyspark/serializers.py:        # On Python 2.6, we can't write bytearrays to streams, so we need to convert them\r\n./python/pyspark/sql/tests.py:        sys.stderr.write('Please install unittest2 to test with Python 2.6 or earlier')\r\n./python/pyspark/streaming/tests.py:        sys.stderr.write('Please install unittest2 to test with Python 2.6 or earlier')\r\n./python/pyspark/tests.py:        sys.stderr.write('Please install unittest2 to test with Python 2.6 or earlier')\r\n./python/pyspark/tests.py:        # NOTE: dict is used instead of collections.Counter for Python 2.6\r\n./python/pyspark/tests.py:        # NOTE: dict is used instead of collections.Counter for Python 2.6\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR only proposes to change visible changes as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./docs/rdd-programming-guide.md:Spark {{site.SPARK_VERSION}} works with Python 2.6+ or Python 3.4+. It can use the standard CPython interpreter,\r\n./docs/rdd-programming-guide.md:Note that support for Python 2.6 is deprecated as of Spark 2.0.0, and may be removed in Spark 2.2.0.\r\n./python/pyspark/context.py:            warnings.warn(\"Support for Python 2.6 is deprecated as of Spark 2.0.0\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis one is already correct:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./docs/index.md:Note that support for Java 7, Python 2.6 and old Hadoop versions before 2.6.5 were removed as of Spark 2.2.0.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n grep -r \"Python 2.6\" .\r\n grep -r \"python 2.6\" .\r\n ```\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-19T14:30:53Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:41:36Z","closed_at":"2017-07-20T08:05:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f00cf43653120651901d01356488ef0e00c07b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18682/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18682/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18682/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/95e9d235a5893f9cc0d7e3b679f8e19ceacd607e","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:minor-python.26","ref":"minor-python.26","sha":"95e9d235a5893f9cc0d7e3b679f8e19ceacd607e","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are mainly two reasons for this reorg:\r\n* Some params are placed in ```RFormulaBase```, while others are placed in ```RFormula```, this is disordered. \r\n* ```RFormulaModel``` should have params ```handleInvalid```, ```formula``` and ```forceIndexLabel```, that users can get invalid values handling policy, formula or whether to force index label if they only have a ```RFormulaModel```. So we need move these params to ```RFormulaBase``` which is also inherited by ```RFormulaModel```.\r\n* ```RFormulaModel``` should support set different ```handleInvalid``` when cross validation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using the MetadataLogFileIndex to read back a table, we don't respect the user provided schema as the proper column types. This can lead to issues when trying to read strings that look like dates that get truncated to DateType, or longs being truncated to IntegerType, just because a long value doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests and manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior: in Mesos cluster mode, the driver failover_timeout is set to zero. If the driver temporarily loses connectivity with the Mesos master, the framework will be torn down and all executors killed.\r\n\r\nProposed change: make the failover_timeout configurable via a new option, spark.mesos.driver.failoverTimeout. The default value is still zero.\r\n\r\nNote: with non-zero failover_timeout, an explicit teardown is needed in some cases. This is captured in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21458\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test to make sure the config option is set while creating the scheduler driver.\r\n\r\nRan an integration test with mesosphere/spark showing that with a non-zero failover_timeout the Spark job finishes after a driver is disconnected from the master.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-18T18:30:56Z","updated_at":"2017-09-19T19:18:00Z","closed_at":"2017-07-19T22:13:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03058ce2863033f97b558d18b8d6c3e000a6d46a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18674/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18674/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18674/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4a001faa612655c6c2aa7a7da85248be862241a","head":{"label":"d2iq-archive:sh-mesos-failover-timeout","ref":"sh-mesos-failover-timeout","sha":"f4a001faa612655c6c2aa7a7da85248be862241a","user":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34087729,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4NzcyOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"d2iq-archive/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when there is a `RpcFailure` need be sent back to client, we call `RpcCallContext.sendFailure`, then it will call `NettyRpcCallContext.send`. However, we can see the follow code snippets in the implementation class.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nprivate[netty] class RemoteNettyRpcCallContext(\r\n    nettyEnv: NettyRpcEnv,\r\n    callback: RpcResponseCallback,\r\n    senderAddress: RpcAddress)\r\n  extends NettyRpcCallContext(senderAddress) {\r\n\r\n  override protected def send(message: Any): Unit = {\r\n    val reply = nettyEnv.serialize(message)\r\n    callback.onSuccess(reply)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is unreasonable, there are two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Send back failure message by `RpcResponseCallback.onSuccess`, we can't get the details exception messages(such as `StackTrace`) in currently implements.\r\n\r\n2. `RpcResponseCallback.onSuccess` and `RpcResponseCallback.onFailure` could have different behavior. Such as:\r\nNettyBlockTransferService#uploadBlock\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nnew RpcResponseCallback {\r\n        override def onSuccess(response: ByteBuffer): Unit = {\r\n          logTrace(s\"Successfully uploaded block $blockId\")\r\n          result.success((): Unit)\r\n        }\r\n        override def onFailure(e: Throwable): Unit = {\r\n          logError(s\"Error while uploading block $blockId\", e)\r\n          result.failure(e)\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, and modified tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-18T13:07:09Z","updated_at":"2017-07-19T12:16:31Z","closed_at":"2017-07-19T12:16:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ceee7bb0828f2736c9e0928528d2148cd02fd9a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18670/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18670/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18670/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/962b6059bcc9f5b54a4e01351993982ef7bab9f1","head":{"label":"ConeyLiu:rpc","ref":"rpc","sha":"962b6059bcc9f5b54a4e01351993982ef7bab9f1","user":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54686577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDY4NjU3Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ConeyLiu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu/spark","description":"Mirror

main goal of this change is to avoid the situation described\r\nin the bug, where an AM restart in the middle of a job may cause\r\nno new executors to be allocated because of faulty logic in the\r\nreset path.\r\n\r\nThe change does two things:\r\n\r\n- fixes the executor alloc manager's reset() so that it does not\r\n  stop allocation after a reset() in the middle of a job\r\n- re-orders the initialization of the YarnAllocator class so that\r\n  it fetches the current executor ID before triggering the reset()\r\n  above.\r\n\r\nThis ensures both that the new allocator gets new requests for executors,\r\nand that it starts from the correct executor id.\r\n\r\nTested with unit tests and by manually causing AM restarts while\r\nrunning jobs using spark-shell in YARN mode.\r\n\r\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-21444, @sitalkedia reported an issue where the `Broadcast.destroy()` call in `MapOutputTracker`'s `ShuffleStatus.invalidateSerializedMapOutputStatusCache()` was failing with an `IOException`, causing the DAGScheduler to crash and bring down the entire driver.\r\n\r\nThis is a bug introduced by #17955. In the old code, we removed a broadcast variable by calling `BroadcastManager.unbroadcast` with `blocking=false`, but the new code simply calls `Broadcast.destroy()` which is capable of failing with an IOException in case certain blocking RPCs time out.\r\n\r\nThe fix implemented here is to replace this with a call to `destroy(blocking = false)` and to wrap the entire operation in `Utils.tryLogNonFatalError`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI haven't written regression tests for this because it's really hard to inject mocks to simulate RPC failures here. Instead, this class of issue is probably best uncovered with more generalized error injection / network unreliability / fuzz testing tools.","created_at":"2017-07-18T00:05:29Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T03:44:36Z","closed_at":"2017-07-18T03:43:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0d7899be5cfd1bb2112c0c5d67ca5991384f76d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18662/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18662/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18662/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5ebcac4ceb14eb8342ce085965b370186b4aba9","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-21444","ref":"SPARK-21444","sha":"a5ebcac4ceb14eb8342ce085965b370186b4aba9","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds vectorized UDFs to the Python API\r\n\r\n**Proposed API**\r\nIntroduce a flag to turn on vectorization for a defined UDF, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@pandas_udf(DoubleType())\r\ndef plus(a, b)\r\n    return a + b\r\n```\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nplus = pandas_udf(lambda a, b: a + b, DoubleType())\r\n```\r\nUsage is the same as normal UDFs\r\n\r\n0-parameter UDFs\r\npandas_udf functions can declare an optional `**kwargs` and when evaluated, will contain a key \"size\" that will give the required length of the output.  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@pandas_udf(LongType())\r\ndef f0(**kwargs):\r\n    return pd.Series(1).repeat(kwargs[\"size\"])\r\n\r\ndf.select(f0())\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests in pyspark.sql that are enabled if pyarrow and Pandas are available.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- [x] Fix support for promoted types with null values\r\n- [x] Discuss 0-param UDF API (use of kwargs)\r\n- [x] Add tests for chained UDFs\r\n- [ ] Discuss behavior when pyarrow not installed / enabled\r\n- [ ] Cleanup pydoc and add user

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-21441\r\n\r\nThis issue can be reproduced by the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval spark = SparkSession\r\n   .builder()\r\n   .appName(\"smj-codegen\")\r\n   .master(\"local\")\r\n   .config(\"spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold\", \"1\")\r\n   .getOrCreate()\r\nval df1 =

when:\r\n(1) SortMergeJoin condition contains CodegenFallback expressions.\r\n(2) In PhysicalPlan tree, SortMergeJoin node  is the child of root node, e.g., the Project in above example.\r\n\r\nThis

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we can't use non-deterministic conditions in Join operator. However, under certain scenarios, we may be able to pull non-deterministic conditions from Join operator. This kind of joining conditions can be useful in some cases.\r\n\r\nRelated discussion:\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15417#discussion_r85295977\r\n2. http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/SQL-Syntax-quot-case-when-quot-doesn-t-be-supported-in-JOIN-tc21953.html#a21973\r\n\r\nIn this attempt, we initially allow non-deterministic equi join keys in Join operators. Because based on SparkSQL's join implementations the equi join keys are evaluated once on joining tables, pulling equi join keys from Join operators won't change the number of calls on non-deterministic expressions. It is more safer than other kinds of joining conditions, e.g. `rand(10) > a && rand(20) < b` where pulling it and pushing down it will possibly change the number of calls of `rand`.\r\n\r\nWe also add a SQL conf to control this new behavior. It is disabled by default.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit

fix some things that will be warnings or errors in 2.12; restore Scala 2.12 profile infrastructure\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds back the infrastructure for a Scala 2.12 build, but does not enable it in the release or Python test scripts.\r\n\r\nIn order to make that meaningful, it also resolves compile errors that the code hits in 2.12 only, in a way that still works with 2.11.\r\n\r\nIt also updates dependencies to the earliest minor release of dependencies whose current version does not yet support Scala 2.12. This is in a sense covered by other JIRAs under the main umbrella, but implemented here. The versions below still work with 2.11, and are the _latest_ maintenance release in the _earliest_ viable minor release.\r\n\r\n- Scalatest 2.x -> 3.0.3\r\n- Chill 0.8.0 -> 0.8.4\r\n- Clapper 1.0.x -> 1.1.2\r\n- json4s 3.2.x -> 3.4.2\r\n- Jackson 2.6.x -> 2.7.9 (required by json4s)\r\n\r\nThis change does _not_ fully enable a Scala 2.12 build:\r\n\r\n- It will also require dropping support for Kafka before 0.10. Easy enough, just didn't do it yet here\r\n- It will require recreating `SparkILoop` and `Main` for REPL 2.12, which is SPARK-14650. Possible to do here too.\r\n\r\nWhat it does do is make changes that resolve much of the remaining gap without affecting the current 2.11 build.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests and build. Manually tested with `./dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.12` to verify it compiles, modulo the exceptions above.","created_at":"2017-07-16T14:17:47Z","updated_at":"2017-09-06T12:47:35Z","closed_at":"2017-09-01T18:24:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"416aa4667191f5b5f3ee676fb41fa428365dbff0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6b0a4c390959340902b9c25ab51284876aa30d6","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-14280","ref":"SPARK-14280","sha":"f6b0a4c390959340902b9c25ab51284876aa30d6","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes Case When code generation to place condition and then expressions' generated code into separated methods if these size could be large. When the method is newly generated, variables for `isNull` and `value` are declared as an instance variable to pass these values (e.g. `isNull1409` and ` value1409`) to the callers of the generated method.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolved three cases:\r\n\r\n1. large code size of condition or then expression\r\n2. large code size of else expression\r\n3. large code size of total conditional

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLike Parquet, this PR aims to depend on the latest Apache ORC 1.4 for Apache Spark 2.3. There are key benefits for Apache ORC 1.4.\r\n\r\n- Stability: Apache ORC 1.4.0 has many fixes and we can depend on ORC community more.\r\n- Maintainability: Reduce the Hive dependency and can remove old legacy code later.\r\n\r\nLater, we can get the following two key benefits by adding new ORCFileFormat in SPARK-20728 (#17980), too.\r\n- Usability: User can use ORC data sources without hive module, i.e, -Phive.\r\n- Speed: Use both Spark ColumnarBatch and ORC RowBatch together. This will be faster than the current implementation in Spark.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the jenkins.","created_at":"2017-07-14T22:05:21Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T06:27:43Z","closed_at":"2017-08-16T06:02:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50d8ef50dc3cb7b19f0514b4ef124d3a6193d5f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f29656cd2a933fad37af33e59115d376026d09d","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-21422","ref":"SPARK-21422","sha":"0f29656cd2a933fad37af33e59115d376026d09d","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2d968a07d211688a9c588deb859667dd8b653b27","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAddress scapegoat warnings for:\r\n- BigDecimal double constructor\r\n- Catching NPE\r\n- Finalizer without super\r\n- List.size is O(n)\r\n- Prefer Seq.empty\r\n- Prefer Set.empty\r\n- reverse.map instead of reverseMap\r\n- Type shadowing\r\n- Unnecessary if condition.\r\n- Use .log1p\r\n- Var could be val\r\n\r\nIn some instances like Seq.empty, I avoided making the change even where valid in test code to keep the scope of the change smaller. Those issues are concerned with performance and it won't matter for tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `SlidingWindowFunctionFrame`, it is now adding all rows to the buffer for which the input row value is equal to or less than the output row upper bound, then drop all rows from the buffer for which the input row value is smaller than the output row lower bound.\r\nThis could result in the buffer is very big though the window is small.\r\nFor example: \r\n```\r\nselect a, b, sum(a) \r\nover (partition by b order by a range between 1000000 following and 1000001 following) \r\nfrom table\r\n```\r\nWe can refine the logic and just add the qualified rows into buffer.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test:\r\nRun sql \r\n`select shop, shopInfo, district, sum(revenue) over(partition by district order by revenue range between 100 following and 200 following) from revenueList limit 10` \r\nagainst a table with 4  columns(shop: String, shopInfo: String, district: String, revenue: Int). The biggest partition is around 2G bytes, containing 200k lines. \r\nConfigure the executor with 2G bytes memory. \r\nWith the change in this pr, it works find.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`UnsafeRowWriter`'s construtor should contain `BufferHolder.reset` to make the writer out of the box.\r\n\r\nWhile writing `UnsafeRow` using `UnsafeRowWriter`, developers should manually call `BufferHolder.reset` to make the `BufferHolder`'s `cursor`(which indicates where to write variable length portion) right in order to write variable length fields like UTF8String, byte[], etc.\r\n\r\nIf a developer doesn't reuse the `BufferHolder` so maybe he never noticed `reset` and the comments in code, the `UnsafeRow` won't be correct if he also writes variable length UTF8String. This API design doesn't make sense. We should reset the `BufferHolder` to make `UnsafeRowWriter` out of the box, but not let user read the code and manually call it.\r\n \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`makeKeyRow(long k1, String k2)` in `RowBasedKeyValueBatchSuite` already tested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes --packages flag for the stand-alone case in cluster mode. Adds to the driver classpath the jars that are resolved via ivy along with any other jars passed to `spark.jars`. Jars not resolved by ivy are downloaded explicitly to a tmp folder on the driver node. Similar code is available in SparkSubmit so we refactored part of it to use it at the DriverWrapper class which is responsible for launching driver in standalone cluster mode.\r\n\r\nNote: In stand-alone mode `spark.jars` contains the user jar so it can be fetched later on at the executor side.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually by submitting a driver in cluster mode within a standalone cluster and checking if dependencies were resolved at the driver side.","created_at":"2017-07-14T01:47:45Z","updated_at":"2017-08-14T11:09:22Z","closed_at":"2017-08-11T23:04:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6644fff372a416ce6a422918a88ce5b6ff3ad27f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db60b273e971dc758c5ff09ca3660f7f63522392","head":{"label":"skonto:fix_packages_stand_alone_cluster","ref":"fix_packages_stand_alone_cluster","sha":"db60b273e971dc758c5ff09ca3660f7f63522392","user":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48892104,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODg5MjEwNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"skonto/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skonto/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is backport of #18418 to Spark 2.1. [SPARK-21391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21391) reported this problem in Spark 2.1.\r\n\r\nThe issue happens in `ExternalMapToCatalyst`. For example, the following codes create ExternalMap`ExternalMapToCatalyst`ToCatalyst to convert Scala Map to catalyst map format.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval data = Seq.tabulate(10)(i => NestedData(1, Map(\"key\" -> InnerData(\"name\", i + 100))))\r\nval ds = spark.createDataset(data)\r\n```\r\nThe `valueConverter` in `ExternalMapToCatalyst` looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (isnull(lambdavariable(ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52, ExternalMapToCatalyst_value_isNull52, ObjectType(class org.apache.spark.sql.InnerData), true))) null else named_struct(name, staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, assertnotnull(lambdavariable(ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52, ExternalMapToCatalyst_value_isNull52, ObjectType(class

org.apache.spark.sql.InnerData), true)).value)\r\n```\r\nThere is a `CreateNamedStruct` expression (`named_struct`) to create a row of `InnerData.name` and `InnerData.value` that are referred by `ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52`.\r\n\r\nBecause `ExternalMapToCatalyst_value52` are local variable, when `CreateNamedStruct` splits expressions to individual functions, the local variable can't be accessed anymore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test suite into
