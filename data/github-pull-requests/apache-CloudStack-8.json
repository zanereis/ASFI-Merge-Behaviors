Description\r\nThis PR adds the qemu'binary option for building SystemVM and provides an option for building Arm64 architecture\r\nBy default, Packer only looks for programs with a binary name of qemu-system-x86_64, while on arm64, the name is qemu-kvm. Running the script directly on arm64 will result in a build failure\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nBefore adding options\r\n![PixPin_2024-04-01_11-01-21](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/32887476/4c92caa0-838a-491d-a8d6-ca39efa38172)\r\n\r\nAfter adding options\r\n![PixPin_2024-04-01_11-00-21](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/32887476/828e869c-4450-4ac0-bafd-8ceabf57f3c3)\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nAn error occurred when using the build script to build. Upon checking the template file, it was found that the system virtual machine image file points to the x86_64 download address. After changing the download address and checksum, the build script was run again and it was found that it still cannot be built normally. When checking the build configuration of the packer, it was found that by default, the qemu component of the packer looks for the qemu-system-x86_64 binary program, which does not exist on the arm64 server. After adding this option and modifying it to qemu-kvm, the script can be built normally\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a second config option for VM CPU topology and implements it for KVM. This can be useful when there is out of band pinning at the hypervisor host and the admin wants to ensure the guest view of L1/2/3 cache among cores matches the physical host.\r\n\r\n Eventually it may be nice extend this to the front end and make it available via service offerings, for now it is only available as VM detail.\r\n \r\n Added and updated several unit tests, I found it difficult to implement the threads setting with the existing implementation of `cpu.corespersocket` so the logic is reworked quite a bit.  Also maintains the default topology grouping of 4 or 6 cores per socket when none is provided.  It will ignore custom topology if the result doesn't make sense (e.g. service offering's core count doesn't divide evenly into the `cpu.corespersocket` and `cpu.threadspercore` settings, similar to the implementation before that would ignore if `cpu.corespersocket` didn't divide evenly into the total cores.\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTested locally with combinations of corespersocket and threadspercore.

Description\r\n\r\nSometimes the users delete the volumes by mistake. This enhancement provides a solution to backup the volume before it's deleted. The user will be able to see the snapshot in CloudStack UI/CLI and create only a volume from it.\r\nA task will check (by default every 5mins) if the snapshots are deleted from StorPool\r\n\r\nGlobal settings to enable the delay delete option:\r\n\r\n`storpool.delete.after.interval` - The interval (in seconds) after the StorPool snapshot will be deleted `storpool.list.snapshots.delete.after.interval` - The interval (in seconds) to fetch the StorPool snapshots with deleteAfter flag\r\n\r\nThis doesn't support encrypted volumes or the option to create a template from the snapshot. Only to restore the volume via the `createVolume` from the snapshot API call \r\n\r\nMinor fix when deleting snapshots\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows KVM storage plugin an opportunity to customize the libvirt disk XML.\r\n\r\nThe new interface method customizeLibvirtDiskDef facilitates plugin-specific config without having to add new methods for each specific thing that may need customizing. Existing plugins should be unaffected because of default implementation in interface.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this adds the capability to define geometry in the libvirt disk definition.\r\n\r\n<!---

In the root admin account, I accessed an instance's page and verified that the volumes tab showed the `Storage` column.\r\n2. In an account that did not have permission to view the storage a volume is allocated, I accessed an instance's page and verified that the volumes tab did not show the `Storage` column.\r\n3.

Description\r\n\r\nDuring the snapshot process of a scheduled snapshot, if the time to create the snapshot is greater than the value of the `job.expire.minutes` global setting, both `async_job` and `snapshot_schedule` records are removed from the database due to the `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraint present in the `async_job_id` foreign key of the `snapshot_schedule` table. This causes snapshot scheduling to stop working as the record of the last `snapshot_schedule` must exist to schedule the next one.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the `async_job_id` constraint was removed so that an expired job does not trigger the removal of the scheduled snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI followed the same steps from `How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?` and verified that the `async_job` was removed but the `snapshot_schedule` was not and the recurring snapshots were working.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR improves/optimises the migration/import performance of external VMware VMs into KVM cluster.\r\n\r\nThe improved migration process still uses the 'virt-v2v' for importing the VMware VMs, and uses exported OVF (of the VMware VM) as the source for the conversion to KVM instance, instead of the cloned VM (in earlier migration, accessing vCenter using 'virt-v2v' from KVM host). For this,\r\n- CloudStack would try to pick the supported host for conversion if one exists, when conversion host is not specified, Otherwise uses any random Up & Enabled host as conversion host. It first checks if the host supports conversion (with virt-v2v, and nbdkit for Ubuntu host) or not. \r\n- CloudStack would then export OVF template files of the source VMware VM (or Cloned VM - for Powered-On VMs, it creates a clone of the source VM on VMware) to the temporary conversion location (uses primary or secondary storage - only NFS pools are supported, defaulted to secondary storage). Any cloned VM and OVF template files are cleaned up after the migration, or if any errors.\r\n- CloudStack then delegates the conversion to a KVM host. The KVM host accesses/uses the exported OVF on the temporary conversion location as the source for the migration using 'virt-v2v' ova input. It creates the temporary disks and xml on the temporary conversion location, and later these are moved to the destination storage pools to import them. Any errors during virt-v2v conversion due to unsupported guest OS, or other reasons are handled, and the conversion operation is failed.\r\n\r\nNoticed 70-90% decrease in the time taken for the migration with this approach (Some earlier linux VM migrations with 3-5 GB disks which took 30-35 mins, now takes 2-3 mins with this improvement).\r\n\r\nThere are no changes in the VMs supported on vCenter - Stopped & Running Linux VMs, and Stopped Windows VMs are supported as earlier. Additionally, Stopped VMs on standalone hosts are supported (can be imported by specifying its default datacenter name - `ha-datacenter` along with host and credentails).\r\n\r\nNote: All 'virt-v2v' limitations are still applicable. CloudStack will not perform any checks about the guest OS compatibility for the virt-v2v library as indicated on: https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473.\r\n\r\nDoc PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/388\r\n\r\nOther improvements in the migration process:\r\n- MS checks the host for instance conversion support (with virt-v2v, and nbdkit for Ubuntu host),  & windows guest conversion support (virtio-win package) before attempting migration (using CheckConvertInstanceCommand / CheckConvertInstanceAnswer).\r\n- MS checks ovftool available in the host to export OVF from vCenter directly, if not MS is used to export OVF \r\n- Auto selects any existing host with instance conversion capability if conversion host not specified (uses detail '`host.instance.conversion`').\r\n- New Parameter: _forcemstoimportvmfiles_ in importVM API, to force MS to import VM files/OVF if required. Added UI support for it.\r\n- New detail '`host.instance.conversion`' with value 'true' is added to host_details table if the host supports instance conversion (needs agent restart after installing virt-v2v).\r\n- New host response parameter '_instanceconversionsupported_' - true, indicating the instance conversion support.\r\n- UI shows Instance Conversion Supported - true in Host details if host supports conversion (with virt-v2v, and nbdkit for Ubuntu host).\r\n- UI shows Supported KVM hosts (with virt-v2v) for conversion on Import VM dialog.\r\n- Support for parallel import/download of OVF disk files on MS or KVM Host, using threads that are configurable using the global settings: _threads.on.ms.to.import.vmware.vm.files_ or _threads.on.kvm.host.to.import.vmware.vm.files_ respectively.\r\n\r\nAlso, fixes: #8632\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML

This PR aims to change the name of the field `instanceId` from the class mentioned above and its related occurrences to `nicId`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to refactor the class `KubernetesClusterResourceModifierActionWorker`. The main goal is to improve the adherence to object-oriented programming principles, specifically encapsulation. In this class, there were a couple of methods that were using reflection, such as `Field.setAccessible()`, to modify object fields directly, which can be seen as a violation of encapsulation, one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows overriding root diskoffering id & size, and expunge old root disk  while restoring VM. This is useful when you have to restore a VM with a new template but the newer template's size is smaller than the existing one.\r\n\r\nNew parameters for `restoreVirtualMachine`:\r\n1. `diskofferingid` - Override root volume's diskoffering\r\n2. `rootdisksize` - Override root volume's size (in GB)\r\n3. `expunge` - Option to expunge old volumes after restore\r\n4. `details` - Option to specify custom parameters for the selected disk offering\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to

Description\r\n\r\nFor both the `listVirtualMachines` and `listVirtualMachineMetrics` APIs, by default, ACS queries all VM details (the `details` parameter is default `all`) and consequently queries the `cloud.vm_stats` table for each VM, creating a summary of statistics. Therefore, every process carried out in the UI that uses the `listVirtualMachines` API also loads the VM statistics, which can cause slowdowns depending on the number of records.\r\n\r\nA new configuration `return.vm.stats.on.vm.list` (with default true), was added, when it is false, the `listVirtualMachines` API will not list the VM's metrics by default.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nCalled listVirtualMachines API, without any parameters:\r\n- before this PR, the all the VM's

Description\r\n\r\nVMs and templates settings can only be manipulated through UI if the user's account role has permission to `updateVirtualMachine` and `updateTemplate` APIs.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen registering a template/ISO through an URL, the Management Servers always validate if the URL is resolvable before inserting an entry in the database, so that the SSVM downloads it afterwards. However, if the Management Servers do not have access to the Internet, and no internal DNS is used in the environment, it is not possible to register a template/ISO through an URL because this validation fails.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, this PR creates the global setting `validate.url.is.resolvable.before.registering.template`, which allows operators to disable this validation. By default, this setting is set to `true` so that the current behavior remains the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nWith the setting set to `true`:\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nACS allows users to delete their own account by calling the `deleteAccount` API via CLI. Fixing this behavior has been previously suggested in this [comment](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7242#issuecomment-1433260909). Furthermore, there's already a feature to prevent a user from deleting their own account via UI; however, slower environments create a small window where it's possible for the user to click the button before it's disabled, allowing deletion even through the UI (see this [comment](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7242#issuecomment-1444300925)).\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses this issue by adding a validation that checks the `UUID` of the caller's account and compares it with the `UUID` of the account they are trying to delete. If they are the same, an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![delete-account](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/56271185/09a6bfdf-65ca-42dd-a249-0539492d505e)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI tested by creating a new account (Temp) and attempted to delete it using a user in this same account via CloudMonkey.\r\nAs expected, an exception was thrown.\r\n\r\nNext, I attempted to delete the account via the UI by rapidly clicking the delete icon. Once again, an exception was thrown without deleting the account.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"errortext\": \"The caller is requesting to delete their own account.

Description\r\n\r\nACS has a job that periodically removes records from the `vm_stats` table that are older than the retention time (setting `vm.stats.max.retention.time`). In environments that have a large amount of statistics being collected and have a long retention time, if the retention time is shortened, table cleaning may fail to finish due to the huge amount of records being deleted leading to a query timeout.\r\n\r\nThe `vm.stats.remove.batch.size` configuration has been added to define the batch size of statistics removal queries. This way, instead of trying to remove all records in a single query, ACS will remove records in batches, with the batch size being defined with the `vm.stats.remove.batch.size setting`. The default value is -1, where no limit will be applied; thus, the current behavior is maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab, I artificially generated 60 million rows on `vm_stats` and set the retention time to one minute. \r\n\r\nBefore the change, the delete job would timeout and no rows would be removed.\r\nAfter applying the change and setting `vm.stats.max.retention.time` to 100000, the table was successfully

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows a given KVM storage implementation to decide if it wants to override the Libvirt disk XML's physical/logical IO size.  For now all in-tree implementations will default to not using this.\r\n\r\nIn the future it may also be possible to extend the disk offerings to provide more granular control.\r\n\r\nNote that using a *logical* sector size other than 512 would require the image to be built to support it, so this may be better suited as a property of the image at some point. Physical sector size can be changed as desired. This at least puts the XML definitions in place as a start.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested locally by modifying an in-tree plugin, but didn't commit that change to avoid changing upstream behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso added unit test to test XML generation.","created_at":"2024-02-29T00:17:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-15T08:36:26Z","closed_at":"2024-03-15T08:36:26Z","merged_at":"2024-03-15T08:36:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"92bfb4dcaace917699c6541b0cd74f44fa2b10e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584072971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzI5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kvm","name":"component:kvm","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30/labels","id":9577330,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AkiNy","number":30,"title":"4.20.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":245,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-06-23T18:43:29Z","updated_at":"2024-12-05T09:42:31Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-11-27T14:52:35Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/8724/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/8724/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/8724/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/229bb47e8c0bae56d26880bedd584d37f0101aa4","head":{"label":"mlsorensen:main-kvm-disk-blocksize","ref":"main-kvm-disk-blocksize","sha":"229bb47e8c0bae56d26880bedd584d37f0101aa4","user":{"login":"mlsorensen","id":1047709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1047709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/mlsorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":413901824,"node_id":"R_kgDOGKukAA","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"mlsorensen/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mlsorensen","id":1047709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1047709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen","html_url":"https://github.com/mlsorensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlsorensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mlsorensen/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nIn the PR #6580, a new parameter called `forced` was added to the API `deleteBackup`; however, these changes were not implemented in the UI; therefore, this PR aims to do so by creating a switch to allow the user to send a request to this API with the `forced` parameter set to true through the UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature

How Has This Been Tested?\r\nFirst, I implemented the modifications and set ACS up in a local environment. Subsequently, I used the browser's dev tool to check if the request being sent had the forced parameter set to true when the switch was toggled, which it did. At last, I created a couple of backups and removed them successfully with the new switch toggled

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a problem when trying to boot up a XenServer VM with a template through an ISO. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Enable `enable.additional.vm.configuration` and add `HVM-boot-params:order` to `allow.additional.vm.configuration.list.xen`.\r\n- Create a XenServer VM with a template.\r\n- Attach an ISO to it.\r\n- Call `updateVirtualMachine` with parameter `extraconfig=HVM-boot-params:order%3Ddcn`\r\n- Start up the VM.\r\n\r\nIt will not finish, with the following log message:\r\n```\r\nINFO  [c.c.h.x.r.XenServer650Resource] (DirectAgent-71:[ctx-6c7bfe3d]) (logid:faabbafa) Appending user extra configuration settings to VM\r\nERROR [o.a.c.h.x.ExtraConfigurationUtility] (DirectAgent-71:[ctx-6c7bfe3d]) (logid:faabbafa) Exception caught while setting VM configuration. exception: null\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter fixing the exception message, we get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR [o.a.c.h.x.ExtraConfigurationUtility] (DirectAgent-25:ctx-0d31d123) (logid:aa40d07d) Exception caught while setting VM configuration: [You tried to add a key-value pair to a map, but that key is already there.]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the exception message and changes the Xen API method called from `addTo` to `set` with `get`, letting Java substitute any duplicates in the HashMap.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, ACS allows users to delete themselves by calling the `deleteUser` API via CLI. Fixing this behavior has been previously suggested in this [comment](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7242#issuecomment-1433260909), as it leaves room for errors if users don't pay enough attention (e.g., when using the console's autocomplete feature), since the parameter passed is the user's `UUID` and it's not easily identifiable to whom this `UUID` belongs. Furthermore, there's already a feature to prevent a user from deleting themselves via the UI; however, slower environments create a small window where it's possible for the user to click the button before it's disabled, allowing deletion even through the UI (see this [comment](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7242#issuecomment-1444300925)).\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses this issue by adding a validation that checks the caller's `UUID` and compares it with the `UUID` of the user they are trying to delete. If they are the same, an exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![delete-user](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/56271185/2d271e4a-169f-455b-9abf-9e5218cfba6a)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI tested by creating a new user (Temp) and attempted to delete it using the same user via CloudMonkey.\r\n\r\nAn exception was thrown, and the user was not deleted.\r\n\r\nNext, I attempted to delete the user via the UI by rapidly clicking the delete icon before being disabled. Once again, an exception was thrown without deleting the user as shown in the screenshot above.\r\n\r\n```(Temp) 🐱 > delete user id=02392623-cd84-4695-ba49-ec187742b2cd \r\n🙈 Error: (HTTP 431, error code 4350) The caller is requesting to delete itself.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a role access check to the `expungeVirtualMachine` command when calling `destroyVirtualMachine` with the expunge parameter. \r\n\r\nCurrently, if you are an admin (even if not Root), it bypasses the `allow.user.expunge.recover.vm` verification and you are always allowed to expunge when calling for `destroyVirtualMachine`.\r\n\r\nThe use case that called for this change was a need for a role of type domain admin to be unable to expunge VMs. It was then found that even with the DENY rule, the user could still expunge through `destroyVirtualMachine` (even on already destroyed VMs, with an API call) and the setting `allow.user.expunge.recover.vm` did nothing. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI created a role, based on the default Domain Admin, and changed the `expungeVirtualMachine` rule to `DENY`. I then created an account with said role.\r\n\r\nI created two VMs and destroyed one of them, verifying that the expunge option did not show up on the GUI. \r\n\r\nI then ran `destroy virtualmachine` on cloudmonkey with `expunge = true` on both VMs and both returned the error `Account does not have permission for expunging`.  Calling the same command without the parameter destroyed the running VM successfully.\r\n\r\nI repeated the tests with a role based on default User:\r\n\r\nWith `allow.user.expunge.recover.vm = true`, it behaved the same as the DomainAdmin-based one.\r\n\r\nWith `allow.user.expunge.recover.vm = false`, it did not allow the expunge action, no matter the role rules.
