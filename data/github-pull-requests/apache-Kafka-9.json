PR integrates KIP-1082 changes into the KIP-1071.  The change centers around clients creating the member id on startup, vs. waiting for the `GroupCoordinator` to create the member id and return it in the response to initial heartbeat.\r\n\r\nThe changes were small and included some changes to the `GroupMetadataManagerTest` streams group related tests. \r\nI'll add comments in-line regarding the updates.  Overall, the impact can be best summarized by stating that now certain actions will now happen one epoch earlier.  For example, task assignment would typically happen on epoch 2 (bumping up from 1) since clients waited for the membership id to be returned and the assignment occurred in the subsequent heartbeat request. \r\n\r\nFor testing, I updated the `GroupMetadataManagerTest` to get all tests passing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

consumer supports auto.offset.reset config option, which is used when there is no initial offset in Kafka (or) if the current offset does not exist any more on the server. This config currently supports earliest/latest/none options. Currently consumer resets might force applications to reprocess large amounts of data from earlier offsets. With infinite storage, its beneficial to have a duration based offset reset strategy. This will allow applications to consume/initialise from a fixed duration when there is no initial offset in Kafka.\r\n\r\nAs part of [KIP-932](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-932%3A+Queues+for+Kafka), we are adding support for share consumer groups. Share consumer groups supports dynamic group configuration property share.auto.offset.reset. This is used to set the initial Share-Partition Start Offset (SPSO) based on the share.auto.offset.reset configuration. Currently share.auto.offset.reset supports earliest and latest options to automatically reset the offset\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Kafka Consumer, we will add support for by_duration:<duration> config

Description \r\nThe `org.reflections` is removed, so the initial logger of worker is only \"root\". However, the e2e needs a non-root logger to verify dynamic logger\r\n\r\nWe can add a logger to `connect_log4j.properties` to fix this e2e. For example:\r\n```\r\nlog4j.logger.org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig=ERROR\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis can make `admin/logger` return two logger - `org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig` and `root`\r\n\r\n## E2E test result\r\n### Before changes\r\n```bash\r\n$

switch shadow plugin from `io.github.goooler.shadow` to `com.gradleup.shadow`\r\n- upgrade plugin version from **8.1.3** to **8.3.5** (release notes: https://gradleup.com/shadow/changes/#v8-3-5-2024-11-03)\r\n\r\n**Rationale:** both previous one and currently used shadow plugins are now deprecated (in favor of `com.gradleup.shadow`):\r\n- `com.github.johnrengelman.shadow` maintenance was transferred to `com.gradleup.shadow`: https://github.com/GradleUp/shadow/tree/8.3.5?tab=readme-ov-file#gradle-shadow\r\n- `io.github.goooler.shadow`: changes are ported to `com.gradleup.shadow`: https://github.com/Goooler/shadow?tab=readme-ov-file#gradle-shadow\r\n\r\n**Pitfall (to keep in mind):** \r\n- https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15532 \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including

What\r\n* In this PR, we've added a class `ShareCoordinatorOffsetsManager`, which tracks the last redundant offset for each share group state topic partition. We have also added a periodic timer job in `ShareCoordinatorService` which queries for the redundant offset at regular intervals and if a valid value is found, issues the `deleteRecords` call to the `ReplicaManager` via the `PartitionWriter`. In this way the size of the partitions is kept manageable.\r\n* Introduced new config `share.coordinator.state.topic.prune.interval.ms` (default 5 mins).\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n* Currently, the `SharePartition` invokes the `DefaultStatePersister` to write data into the internal share group topic `__share_group_state`. This topic is not eligible for compaction.\r\n* If the kafka cluster is run for a long period of time, the topic partitions in `__share_group_state` will be populated with gigantic amount of records.\r\n* In the above scenario if a broker/cluster restarts, all the records will need to be replayed on the leader `ShareCoordinatorShard` resulting in extensive latency during startup.\r\n* One observation is that the records follow a periodic snapshot approach. A snapshot record gets created and then a few incremental updates and after a threshold number,  a snapshot again for each share partition key.\r\n* This implies that older records become redundant after a while since they've been superseded by new snapshots. This provides us an opportunity to relieve some pressure from the partitions.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n* Added appropriate tests for `CoordinatorPartitionWriter`, `ShareCoordinatorOffsetsManager`, `ShareCoordinatorService` and `ShareCoordinatorShard`.\r\n* Extensive manul testing\r\n\r\n### Sample o/p\r\n**Broker logs**\r\n```\r\n[2024-11-29 15:21:38,289] INFO [UnifiedLog

each `log.append()` will add at most 1 index entry, even when the appended data is larger than `log.index.interval.bytes`. One potential issue is that if a follower restarts after being down for a long time, it may fetch data much bigger than `log.index.interval.bytes` at a time. This means that fewer index entries are created, which can increase the fetch time from the consumers.\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR:\r\n* Iterate each batch in `MemoryRecords`. If bytes since last index entry is large than `log.index.interval.bytes`, appending a offset/timestamp index.\r\n* In before, if a LogSegment is new, we set `rollingBasedTimestamp` as largest timestamp in the first `MemoryRecords`. After this PR, `rollingBasedTimestamp` is largest timestamp in the first batch, so the behavior is consistent between leader and follower.\r\n* Remove `LogAppendInfor#shallowOffsetOfMaxTimestamp`. We iterate each batch in `append` function, so we can get the value by `shallowOffsetOfMaxTimestampSoFar`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Introduction\r\nThis PR proposes a change to add support for SSL hot reloading.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this changes warrants a KIP or not. Please let me know if it does.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nSSL certificates are typically short-lived, and while Kafka brokers support dynamic SSL certificate reloads via dynamic configuration, other components still require disruptive restarts to apply updated certificates. This change aims to eliminate such disruptions by allowing SSL certificates to be reloaded dynamically when changes occur. The goal is to improve system uptime and reduce operational overhead.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\nInspired by [Spring Boot's SSL hot reload feature](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/ssl.html#features.ssl.reloading), this implementation triggers an `SslFactory` reconfiguration whenever the keystore or truststore files are modified. Java's `WatchService` API from `java.nio` is used for file changes monitoring. \r\n\r\nA new **`ssl.hot.reload` configuration** is introduced. It can be used by any SslClient (brokers, consumers, producers).\r\n\r\nAll `SslFactories` within a single JVM share the same `WatcherService`. To prevent redundant reconfigurations, a `Quiet Period` is enforced across all watched files, ensuring that related changes do not trigger multiple reconfigurations.\r\n\r\n# Testing Instruction\r\n\r\n1. Generate a keystore and truststore.\r\n2. Append the following to `config/kraft/reconfig-server.properties` :\r\n```\r\nsecurity.protocol=SSL\r\nssl.key.password=<password>\r\nssl.keystore.location=/path/to/keystore.p12\r\nssl.keystore.password=<password>\r\nssl.truststore.location=/path/to/ca.p12\r\nssl.truststore.password=<password>\r\n# new option\r\nssl.hot.reload=true\r\n```\r\n3. Build the code in this branch `./gradlew jar`.\r\n4. Start the broker `bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/reconfig-server.properties`.\r\n5. Replace the `PLAINTEXT` listener with `SSL` then restart the broker.\r\n```\r\nlisteners=SSL://:9092,CONTROLLER://:9093\r\ninter.broker.listener.name=SSL\r\nadvertised.listeners=CONTROLLER://localhost:9093,SSL://localhost:9092\r\n```\r\n6. Create a `producer.properties` file:\r\n```\r\nsecurity.protocol=SSL\r\nssl.key.password=<password>\r\nssl.keystore.location=/path/to/keystore.p12\r\nssl.keystore.password=<password>\r\nssl.truststore.location=/path/to/ca.p12\r\nssl.truststore.password=<password>\r\nssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=\r\n# new option\r\nssl.hot.reload=true\r\n```\r\n7. let's increase logging level for `tool` to `INFO` so changes are reflected in logs:\r\n```\r\nsed -i 's/WARN/INFO/g'  ./config/tools-log4j.properties\r\n```\r\n8. Start a console producer:\r\n```\r\n./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test1 --producer.config path/to/producer.properties\r\n```\r\n9. Let's simulate a certificate renewal by moving the keystore to a different location then bringing it back.\r\n``` mv /path/to/keystore.p12  /other/path/to/keystore.p12 && mv  /other/path/to/keystore.p12 /path/to/keystore.p12```\r\n\r\nAfter 30 seconds\r\n\r\nProducer logs:\r\n```\r\n[2024-11-29 12:39:47,712] INFO Created new CLIENT SSL engine builder with keystore

work on `ShareConsumerTest.testAcquisitionLockTimeoutOnConsumer`. First, mark the test as flaky since it fails occasionally and it would be best to get a decent number of passes before assuming it's no longer flaky. Then, change the assertions so that the test checks which records were received before it counts them (we might get too many records because the wrong records are being returned, or because records are actually being duplicated). The rare failures appear to be related to returning too many records, so it would be good to see whether we can learn more about the duplication.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of other improvements too. Reducing the number of share-group state partitions so we don't have the overhead of creating 50 partitions when a few will do. Changing the warm-up logic since that has been observed very occasionally to assert.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-29T07:52:56Z","updated_at":"2024-12-02T08:09:20Z","closed_at":"2024-12-01T18:26:28Z","merged_at":"2024-12-01T18:26:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"44cb90222c680b076f563004f8c0e7d8655d77af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

PR and the future following ones aim to refactor the big `GroupMetadataManager` class and split it into multiple classes. This PR specifically introduces the `GroupStore` class, which contains the metadata for all groups. \r\n\r\nThe high level design: mainly introducing the following classes, each containing specific properties and methods: \r\n1.  `GroupStore`: metadata for all groups.\r\n2. `ShareGroupMetadataManager`: has a reference to `GroupStore` + properties and methods related to ShareGroup metadata management.\r\n3. `ConsumerGroupMetadataManager`: has a reference to `GroupStore` + properties and methods related to ConsumerGroup metadata management.\r\n4. `ClassicGroupMetadataManager`: has a reference to `GroupStore` + properties and methods related to ClassicGroup metadata management.\r\n\r\nSince `ConsumerGroupMetadataManager` and `ClassicGroupMetadataManager` share many methods, a helper class may be defined to avoid method

for Round Robing partitioner and fix of Round Robing uneven distribution after KIP-480\r\n* Fixed uneven RR distirbution problem after KIP-480 (Sticky Partitioner) : Issue was multiple partition() calls for the same record causing uneven distribution. Resolved by decrementing the counter in onNewBatch.\r\n* Added partition reuse: Implemented topicLastPartitionMap to reuse the last assigned partition, reducing counter increments.\r\n* Thread-safe counter management: Used ConcurrentMap and AtomicInteger to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded environments.\r\n* Optimized and modular partition logic: Moved logic to roundRobinPartition for better readability and maintainability.\r\n* Graceful handling of edge cases: Added checks for empty partitions, ensuring stable behavior.\r\n* Separation of concerns: Split responsibilities across partition(), onNewBatch(), and helper methods for cleaner, extensible code.\r\n\r\nBy replacing ThreadLocal with a concurrent map, the state is managed more predictably in a multithreaded environment. Directly accessing the last partition avoids redundant calculations, especially for topics with frequently revisited partitions and the modular design makes the logic easier to follow and extend.\r\n\r\nRelated issues\r\nKAFKA-9965/KAFKA-13303\r\n\r\nTests:\r\nAdjusted tests for RoundRobinPartitionerTest.\r\nPresent a little disbalance.

About\r\n`SharePartition#acquire` does not honor the rollback state. This causes two issues.\r\n\r\n1) leaked `acquisitionLockTimeoutTask - `SharePartition#acquire` create a new `acquisitionLockTimeoutTask` for the \"available\" batch, however, the available batch in transition already has a `acquisitionLockTimeoutTask`, so the leaked `acquisitionLockTimeoutTask` will corrupt the state later.\r\n\r\n2) null `acquisitionLockTimeoutTask` in a \"acquired\" batch - this can be reproduced by following order.\r\n  a) the batch is in transition - current state is `AVAILABLE` and rollback state is `ACQUIRED`\r\n  b)`SharePartition#rollbackOrProcessStateUpdates` is processing RPC, so it does not call `InFlightState#completeStateTransition`\r\n  c)`SharePartition#acquire` assumes the batch is available, so it changes the state from `AVAILABLE` to `ACQUIRED` and create a new `acquisitionLockTimeoutTask`\r\n  d) `SharePartition#rollbackOrProcessStateUpdates` complete the RPC - it commit the state and cancel the `acquisitionLockTimeoutTask` - that means the batch is in `ACQUIRED` but it does not have `acquisitionLockTimeoutTask`\r\nthe next AcknowledgeRequest tries to update the state to `ACKNOWLEDGED` but it encounters NPE `acquisitionLockTimeoutTask` and then the request gets hanging until timeout\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAdded a unit test to verify the changed behaviour and tested with the help of originally present unit/integration tests for share consumers.","created_at":"2024-11-27T19:25:31Z","updated_at":"2024-12-06T17:32:08Z","closed_at":"2024-12-06T17:32:08Z","merged_at":"2024-12-06T17:32:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"15206d5083b18d7ff8afd360304dc17e90f7a35b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

ELR is enabled, we need to set a cluster-level min.insync.replicas, and remove all broker-level overrides. The reason for this is that if brokers disagree about which partitions are under min ISR, it breaks the KIP-966 replication invariants. In order to enforce this, when the eligible.leader.replicas.version feature is turned on, we automatically remove all broker-level min.insync.replicas overrides, and create the required cluster-level override if needed. Similarly, if the cluster was created with eligible.leader.replicas.version enabled, we create a similar cluster-level record. In both cases, we don't allow setting overrides for individual brokers afterwards, or removing the cluster-level override.\r\n\r\nSplit ActivationRecordsGeneratorTest up into multiple test cases rather than having it be one giant test case.\r\n\r\nFix a bug in QuorumControllerTestEnv where we would replay records manually on objects, racing with the active controller thread. Instead, we should simply ensure that the initial bootstrap records contains what we want.","created_at":"2024-11-26T23:45:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T21:42:25Z","closed_at":"2025-01-08T21:42:25Z","merged_at":"2025-01-08T21:42:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec49a60e4f690f311060045ee1feb20d99837f97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/63f51a90ba8908e707ffb4aaee3910e303ea68cc","head":{"label":"CalvinConfluent:KAFKA-16540-config-setup","ref":"KAFKA-16540-config-setup","sha":"63f51a90ba8908e707ffb4aaee3910e303ea68cc","user":{"login":"CalvinConfluent","id":83986057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg2MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83986057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":577465304,"node_id":"R_kgDOImtr2A","name":"kafka","full_name":"CalvinConfluent/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CalvinConfluent","id":83986057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTg2MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83986057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CalvinConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CalvinConfluent/kafka","description":"Mirror

and workarounds for some of the peculiarities of the Android runtime. This is by no means complete Android support, but gets a little bit closer.\r\n* fix for `Socket.getInetAddress()` returning null when `SocketChannel.configureBlocking(false)` has been called on it.\r\n* A number of runtime-loaded classes and methods were allowed to fail if they couldn't be found:\r\n  * `sun.security.krb5.KrbException`\r\n  * `org.ietf.jgss.GSSException`\r\n  * `java.util.zip.CRC32C`\r\n  * `java.util.zip.Checksum.update()`\r\n\r\nThere didn't seem to be existing tests for these classes, so none were added. Most of these occur in class static blocks, and would be hard to mock anyway. Behavioral changes include: not throwing exceptions from said class static blocks.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]
