with Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nAlso allow for setting of `runas_user` in the Elasticsearch Controller Service, which may be of use to impersonate a user within Elasticsearch from NiFi, without having the user's credentials (but where the connecting NiFi user/token is granted permission to impersonate the alternate user).\r\n\r\nOther changes include:\r\n- removing unused dependencies from Elasticsearch component POMs\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n- Attempted to verify changes using LogTo.io as an OIDC and JWT IdP, but it turns out that LogTo provides Access Token JWTs with a `typ` of `at+jwt`, which Elasticsearch cannot currently handle (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/119370)\r\n- Verified using Keycloak instead (with a machine-to-machine/service-account only `Client` setup to provide Access Tokens)\r\n- Configure Elasticsearch to allow [JWT realm](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/jwt-auth-realm.html) authentication, an example might be like:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n    jwt.keycloak_test_jwt:\r\n      order: 3\r\n      token_type: access_token\r\n      client_authentication.type: shared_secret\r\n      allowed_issuer: https://localhost:9443/realms/elasticsearch-test\r\n      allowed_audiences: [account]\r\n      allowed_subjects: [e61503d0-8fab-473e-9f70-95d91b085f52]\r\n      allowed_signature_algorithms: [ES384]\r\n      pkc_jwkset_path: https://keycloak:9443/realms/elasticsearch-test/protocol/openid-connect/certs\r\n      claims.principal: preferred_username\r\n      ssl.certificate_authorities:\r\n        [/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/step/certs/root_ca.crt]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that NiFi requires the IdP to be running over HTTPS (for which SmallStep CA was used to generate certificates locally).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14048](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14048) Adjusts the framework web application security configuration to support fallback to the `RSA` key algorithm and the `PS512` JSON Web Signature algorithm when the runtime Java Security Provider does not support the `Ed25519` key algorithm.\r\n\r\nNiFi versions prior to 2.0.0 used `RSA` with `PS512` for signing and verifying Application Bearer Tokens. NiFi 2.0.0 changed the implementation to use `Ed25519` with `EdDSA` for smaller key and signature sizes providing similar or better security than RSA.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this writing, Java Security Providers that enforce Federal Information Processing Standards do not include `Ed25519` in the list of approved algorithms. [FIPS 186-5](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/186-5/final) published in February 2023 adds `Ed25519` to the list of approved algorithms, and FIPS providers such as [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bouncy-castle-java-fips/roadmap/) have submitted versions for approval that include `Ed25519`.\r\n\r\nAlthough the project does not provide official support for operating in a mode compatible with FIPS providers, enabling fallback support for `RSA` enables a transitional upgrade path for current deployments. Instead of introducing a new framework configuration property, changes in this pull request use [java.security.Security](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/security/Security.html) to determine whether `Ed25519` is supported on startup. In absence of support for `Ed25519`, the framework selects `RSA` for rotating JWT key pair generation and `PS512` for token signing. The framework logs a message indicating the selected algorithm. This approach also provides the opportunity for subsequent removal when support for `Ed25519` is incorporated in providers such as Bouncy Castle.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

The list variables are named `PROPERTY_DESCRIPTORS` and the set variables are named `RELATIONSHIPS`. Also for common `PropertyDescriptor` objects defined in a parent a method, a method  `getCommonPropertyDescriptors` is defined to allow children to use them. This was done for the following parent and children classes (parents on left and children which use the method are on the right).\r\n\r\n1. AbstractAMQPProcessor - ConsumeAMQP, PublishAMQP\r\n2. AbstractAwsMachineLearningJobStarter - StartAwsTextractJob\r\n3. AbstractAwsMachineLearningJobStatusProcessor - GetAwsTextractJobStatus\r\n4. AbstractAzureCosmosDBProcessor - PutAzureCosmosDBRecord\r\n5. AbstractEmailProcessor - ConsumeIMAP, ConsumePOP3\r\n6. AbstractGridFSProcessor (applies this also to relationships) - FetchGridFS, PutGridFS\r\n7. AbstractHadoopProcessor - AbstractFetchHDFSRecord, AbstractPutHDFSRecord (PutParquet but doesn't use common method), CreateHadoopSequenceFile, DeleteHDFS, FetchHDFS, GetHDFS, GetHDFSEvents, GetHDFSFileInfo, ListHDFS, MoveHDFS, PutHDFS\r\n8. AbstractJoltTransform - JoltTransformJSON, JoltTransformRecord\r\n9. AbstractMongoProcessor - DeleteMongo, GetMongo, PutMongo, PutMongoBulkOperations, PutMongoRecord, RunMongoAggregation\r\n10.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14116](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14116) Adds the `UnnecessaryVarargsArrayCreation` rule to the standard PMD configuration.\r\n\r\nThis rule detects unnecessary

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14115](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14115) Adjusts the framework Jetty Server configuration to set standard HTTP headers for all responses, regardless of web application.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation uses the Spring Security `HeaderWriterFilter` and applies standard Servlet Filters to configured web applications. This covers both framework REST API and custom extensions, but does not include requests to the root web server path.\r\n\r\nThe updated implementation replaces the Servlet Filter approach with a `HeaderWriterHandler` to set the same response headers using a Jetty `Handler` class. The change introduces a new `StandardServerProvider` to decouple Jetty `Server` instance initialization from lifecycle operations. The `StandardServerProvider` includes decoupled tests for basic operation, including returning expected response headers.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to

In addition Intellij suggestions were made more or less to the various unit tests which exercised the changed processors and in some cases to the processors themselves.\r\nWhere  possible renamed all list of PropertyDescriptor to PROPERTIES and the set of RelationShip to RELATIONSHIPS ensured they were both `private static final` and ensured all properties and relationships are on individual lines for increased readability.\r\nAll processors should now either use `List.of` or `Stream.concat` (where concatenation is needed between multiple lists) for declaring their list of property descriptor and `Set.of` when declaring their relationships.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14073](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14073) Adds the [Maven PMD Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/) to the set of plugins run as part of the `contrib-check` profile for verifying correctness and style of code changes.\r\n\r\nThe [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) project augments existing code style evaluation from Checkstyle and introduces tuned analysis rules for catching common problems.\r\n\r\nThanks to recent efforts to cleanup and standardize code across the repository, the changes in this pull request are limited to bringing a handful of classes in line with common rules. Most of these changes involve removing or annotating unused private fields, and bringing consistency to the use of generic types.\r\n\r\nThe plugin configuration uses the `pmd-ruleset.xml`, which is based on the default set of rules, but removes some that would have involved too many changes to existing code. The PMD configuration excludes code generated from ANTLR and JAXB plugins from evaluation.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include simplifying the Maven options for the GitHub `ci-workflow`, removing the need for selective exclusion of certain modules. These adjustments make it easier to run the `pmd:check` goal without a large number of module exclusions.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Adds GetAzureBlobStorageMetadata_v12 to support retrieving tags and metadata.  PutAzureBlobStorage_v12's behavior is modeled after how PutS3Object sets tags and metadata.  GetAzureBlobStorageMetadata_v12 behaves slightly differently than GetS3ObjectMetadata as GetAzureBlobStorageMetadata_v12 also supports retrieving tags.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Then we tried to\r\nload all the python files in the package, including other processors which may\r\nhave other dependencies. The result was that the requested processor could not\r\nbe loaded.\r\n\r\nAfter the change: we only load the requested processor and any non-processor\r\nhelper files which are present in the package.\r\n\r\n### Enable py4j integration tests in system-tests\r\n    \r\nThere are 26 tests (+1 added now) in PythonControllerInteractionIT.java, which\r\nis in nifi-py4j-integration-tests, but these were not run in any of the CI\r\njobs. I have added them to system-tests, because integration-tests explicitly\r\nskips nifi-py4j-integration-tests with a comment that it is run as part of\r\nsystem-tests.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14026](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14026) Adds the `nifi-security-proxied-entity` module under `nifi-commons` to provide a shared location for utilities related to Proxied Entities for HTTP requests and responses.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-web-security` module has a `ProxiedEntitiesUtils` class that supports encoding and decoding, and the `nifi-toolkit-client` module had a dependency on `nifi-web-security` for encoding proxied entities. With the `nifi-web-security` module including many more dependencies than `nifi-toolkit-client` required, the `nifi-security-proxied-entity` module has a `StandardProxiedEntityEncoder` implementation to support the methods required in both places, without unnecessary dependencies.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing the Google Guava dependency from `nifi-toolkit-cli`, which is no longer required following the removal of transitive framework dependencies from other toolkit modules.\r\n\r\nThe new Proxied Entity Encoder includes unit tests that exercise various cases supported in the original `ProxiedEntitiesUtils` class.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

I've tried to make the implementation in nifi-registry as similar as possible. However, a major overhaul to OIDC was done as part of [NIFI-4890](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4890), and those changes were not ported to nifi-registry. So I've tried to keep the changes as minimal as I can, which means that there will continue to be differences in the OIDC implementation between nifi and nifi-registry.\r\n\r\n### Questions / Thoughts\r\n- ~I'm using Spring `SimpleGrantedAuthority` because that's what the current implementation of nifi uses, but as far as I can tell there's no real reason to use it - I'm just packing the group name into it and pulling it out later. It'd probably be cleaner to just pass around the group names.~ EDIT: I made this change - now passing the group names as strings instead.\r\n- I haven't added any unit tests yet - as this is my first PR I'd like to get confirmation that the implementation direction makes sense before I add tests.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

been present since fb2a82c035 / PR #9288 , which changed the way documentations are generated. The new view dyamically fetches the information to be shown from the NIFI API, which did not return the component tags for Python processors in the manifest. Since the new documentation viewer always expects the tags to be returned, it has errored out when a python component was selected, which resulted in none of the documentation had been shown.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to fix this issue by adding the missing information to the API response.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14052](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14052) Removes non-deterministic build properties to address several findings from reviews of [reproducible builds](https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central/blob/master/content/org/apache/nifi/nifi/README.md).\r\n\r\nThe Runtime Manifest generation process populates several build properties that are specific to the build environment, and none of these properties are used for the manifest itself. The following properties are removed:\r\n\r\n- Built-By\r\n- Maven-Home\r\n- Build-Java-Home\r\n- Build-Os-Version\r\n\r\nDisabling [episode](https://github.com/highsource/jaxb-tools/wiki/Using-Episodes) file generation for code generated from XML Schema Definitions removes unused files that contain build timestamps.\r\n\r\nEnabling the [sortOutput property](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-2.X---Integration-and-Configuration#configuration-properties) for Swagger OpenAPI specifications ensures deterministic output for YAML and JSON files that define the REST API.\r\n\r\nFor the `apache-release` profile, which is used for the release process, disabling the [Build Number Maven Plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/buildnumber-maven-plugin/) and setting standard values for `buildBranch`, `buildTag`, and `buildRevision` ensures that NAR `MANIFEST.MF` files contain standard values that reflect the release version.\r\n\r\nThese changes together address the issues highlighted from the output of [diffoscope for NiFi 2.0.0](https://github.com/jvm-repo-rebuild/reproducible-central/blob/master/content/org/apache/nifi/nifi/nifi-2.0.0.diffoscope).\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\n- [ ] New dependencies are compatible with the [Apache License 2.0](https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) according to the [License

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14049](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14049) Adds a `PEMEncodedSSLContextProvider` Controller Service implementation of the `SSLContextProvider` interface added in [NIFI-14027](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14027). The new Provider Service supports Private Keys and Certificates encoded using the [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) format as an alternative to the `StandardSSLContextService` implementation. The majority of extension components now support the `SSLContextProvider` interface for SSLContext Service properties following changes in [NIFI-14027](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14027).\r\n\r\nThe `PEMEncodedSSLContextProvider` builds on PEM private key and certificate handling implemented in [NIFI-14001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14001) for framework configuration.\r\n\r\nThe Provider includes a `Private Key Source` property supporting `Properties` or `Files` to indicate whether the Private Key and Certificate Chain should be loaded directly from property values or loaded from file references. The `Private Key Source` property also has an option for `Undefined`, indicating that the Private Key and Certificate Chain are not required. This option supports TLS without a client certificate when connectivity requires only custom certificate authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Provider includes a `Certificate Authorities Source` property supporting `Properties` or `System` to indicate whether custom certificate authorities must be configured. The `System` option indicates that the Provider should use the default Java certificate authorities.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Two strategies were employed. \r\n1. Where the unit test generated temporary files but did not clean them up, I added the use of Junit 5 `TempDir` annotation to allow Junit to handle the creation and deletion of temporary files .\r\n2. Where the code called by the unit test generated temporary files, I added the use of the Junit 5 `AfterAll` annotation to allow for globbing files using file patterns with `java.nio.file.Files.newDirectoryStream` and then deleting them.\r\n\r\nThe one directory I could not delete was the `poifiles`  directory created by all the Excel unit tests found in the `nifi-poi-bundle`. When trying to delete that directory after each of those unit tests, it seemed to clobber the `poifiles` directory for each of the subsequent tests causing the unit tests to fail due to files not existing which thereby failed the build.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14041](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14041) - Improve MockPropertyValue and EL evaluation validation\r\n\r\nWhile building a processor, I noticed that the test framework would throw an error if I'm in the below situation:\r\n\r\n- Processor with input forbidden\r\n- Property with EL support with Environment scope\r\n- Evaluation of the EL with .evaluateAttributeExpressions(Map<String,String>)\r\n\r\nThis should not throw an error. This PR is to fix this case as well as covering the overall EL evaluation in the test framework with proper unit testing.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14029](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14029) - BitBucket Registry Client\r\n\r\nAdding an implementation of the Registry Client to integrate with BitBucket. For reference, APIs are described here:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro\r\n\r\nIn addition to the implementation itself, two bugs are fixed:\r\n\r\n- NPE in case the initialization fails for some reason. In this case, we already called `clientInitialized.set(true)` and this caused to always have the directory exclusion filter being `null`. This is now fixed.\r\n- NPE in the `deregisterFlow` method. This happens when we start version control and for some reason, something fails after the file has been committed. In that case, we delete the content in the repo. Because we didn't populate the snapshot metadata, this was causing a NPE.\r\n\r\n````\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke \"org.apache.nifi.registry.flow.RegisteredFlowSnapshotMetadata.setBucketIdentifier(String)\" because \"snapshotMetadata\" is null\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.registry.flow.git.AbstractGitFlowRegistryClient.updateBucketReferences(AbstractGitFlowRegistryClient.java:548)\r\n\tat org.apache.nifi.registry.flow.git.AbstractGitFlowRegistryClient.deregisterFlow(AbstractGitFlowRegistryClient.java:255)\r\n````\r\n\r\nRegarding the implementation itself. Three authentication methods are supported:\r\n\r\n- Basic Auth with Username and App Password\r\n- OAuth 2.0 - I tested the Client Credentials Flow with OAuth Consumers. Note that the endpoint to configure in the controller service for OAuth is `https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token`. It is important to also note that, when using the Client Credentials flow, the permissions/scopes set at the OAuth Consumer level in the BitBucket Admin UI are ignored and it will inherit the permissions of the **owner** of the OAuth Consumer. This is quite misleading...\r\n- Access Token - I have not tested this option as this is a paid option of BitBucket.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14035](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14035) Upgrades Spring Security dependencies from 6.3.4 to [6.4.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/releases/tag/6.4.0) along with supporting dependencies including [OpenSAML 5](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OSAML/overview), which is the current supported version.\r\n\r\nUpdates include adjusting Spring Security dependencies to [select OpenSAML 5](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/opensaml.html#_selecting_opensaml_5), and replacing OpenSAML 4 references with current versions.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adding a Spring Framework [RestClient](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/integration/rest-clients.html#rest-restclient) for OIDC requests to support current Spring Security token handling clients. Several components still require the `RestOperations` interface, requiring the configuration to include both the `RestClient` and `RestOperations` beans.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14027](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14027) Adds the `SSLContextProvider` Controller Service interface to the `nifi-ssl-context-service-api` and refactors most existing references from `SSLContextService` to `SSLContextProvider`.\r\n\r\nThe `SSLContextProvider` interface includes the `createContext` and `createTrustManager` methods from `SSLContextService` along with a new `createKeyManager` method.\r\n\r\nThese methods return the common objects necessary for TLS communication, without providing access to the underlying configuration properties. This abstraction decouples TLS communication capabilities from key and certificate files. This approach provides the foundation for subsequent support of PEM Key and Certificate files in a new service implementation, building on framework support implemented in [NIFI-14001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14001).\r\n\r\nThe following extension components retain references to `SSLContextService` as they require direct access to the Key Store and Trust Store configuration files:\r\n\r\n- CaptureCahngeMySQL\r\n- StandardHashiCorpVaultClientService\r\n- ConsumeJMS\r\n- PublishJMS\r\n- Kafka3ConnectionService\r\n- ConsumeMQTT\r\n- PublishMQTT\r\n\r\nAll other Processors and Controller Services keep existing property names, but reference the `SSLContextProvider` interface in place of the `SSLContextService` interface.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14020](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14020) - Add Record and Demarcator support to ConsumeGCPubSub\r\n\r\nAt the moment, ConsumeGCPubSub will generate one FlowFile per consumed message (the Batch Size property is only specifying the maximum number of messages we may pull from the subscription with one API call). This can be extremely inefficient.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the Kafka processors, we should add the option to have multiple Processing Strategies:\r\n\r\n- Flow File - which is the current behavior - where one message is one FlowFile and FlowFile attributes will be used to store the attributes associated with the message as well as some information such as message ID, ack ID, etc.\r\n- Demarcator - where messages will be appended into a single FlowFile with a custom demarcator between each message. In this case specific attributes associated to messages will be lost. This however is the most efficient strategy if very high throughput is required and message format is allowing this approach.\r\n- Record - where a reader and writer can be specified to process the messages. This is useful if we want to change message format on the fly or if the message format is not allowing the demarcator strategy. In addition, an output strategy is available with two allowable values:\r\n  - Value - messages are all added in the same flowfile with the specified writer. In this case specific attributes associated to messages will be lost.\r\n  - Wrapper - in this case, we are overriding the schema of the writer to include the metadata of the message as well as a map of its attributes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14014](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14014) - Use Node ID instead of Instance ID for metrics endpoints\r\n\r\nWhen NiFi is starting, if configured for clustering, the instance will get assigned a Node Identifier that will be persisted across restart via local cache. This Node ID should be used for identifying the data points of the metrics exposed by the `/flow/metrics/{provider}` endpoints. If NiFi is not configured for clustering, we can fallback to using the instance identifier. Besides, using the Node ID is better as this is the information made available via the Cluster view in the UI when looking at the details of nodes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13682](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13682) - Versioning breaks in case of style change on labels\r\n\r\nStyle for labels is a map which can have up to two keys: `font-size` and `background-color`. If between two versions, this map has a different key set, the current code creates an issue where we would always block any version change / any revert local changes because the current code merges the changes of the two versions and it will show as local changes that we'll never be able to revert. This PR changes the code to not merge the styles, but strictly apply the style of the desired version.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14009](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14009) - Move Toolkit Client code in its own nifi-toolkit-client module\r\n\r\nCurrently, the nifi-toolkit-cli module contains the code for a client interacting with the NiFi APIs. This code is used by the CLI itself but is also referenced in the the NiFi system test suite.\r\n\r\nThis JIRA is to move this code in its own module to have a cleaner separation. A new module nifi-toolkit-client will contain this code, and both the CLI and system test suite will depend on this new module.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14005](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14005) - GetFileResource processor\r\n\r\nThe goal of this new GetFileResource processor is to provide a way for a user to inject a File Resource as a FlowFile with custom attributes. It means that the processor would be able to specify a path to a file and its content would be used as FlowFile's content. By leveraging the asset feature, it makes it easy to load a test dataset as a FlowFile in a cloud native environment (container based).\r\n\r\nAlternatives that have been considered:\r\n- GenerateFlowFile with a \"Custom File/Content\" property. However, a processor being able to access the local file system needs to be associated with a specific set of permissions and that would be a significant breaking change for all users already using GenerateFlowFile processor where such permissions are enforced.\r\n- GetFile with some specific improvements. However, longer term we would likely want to completely remove this processor and only have ListFile/FetchFile. Beside, its configuration is overly complex for the intended goal here.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n- tested with local file reference\r\n- tested with file referenced via URL\r\n- tested using Asset feature and Parameter reference\r\n\r\nFor information:\r\n\r\n````\r\n$ ./bin/cli.sh nifi create-asset -p nifi-cli.properties -pcid dc39db55-1eb2-3d26-9a8a-caaf097cfcc2 -af /Users/pierre/dev/myFile.txt\r\n\r\nb099141f-2bc4-3073-8dc0-243dac470f08\r\n\r\n$ ./bin/cli.sh nifi add-asset-reference -p nifi-cli.properties -aid b099141f-2bc4-3073-8dc0-243dac470f08 -pcid dc39db55-1eb2-3d26-9a8a-caaf097cfcc2 -pn MyAsset\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe parameter `#{MyAsset}` can then be used in the processor (assuming proper Parameter Context binding on the Process Group).\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14001) Adds framework support for PEM private keys and certificates as an alternative to Java Key Stores for TLS communication.\r\n\r\nThe implementation adds `PEM` as a supported value for the following application properties:\r\n\r\n- `nifi.security.keystoreType`\r\n- `nifi.security.truststoreType`\r\n\r\nConfiguring `PEM` for `nifi.security.keystoreType` requires setting the following properties:\r\n\r\n- `nifi.security.keystore.privateKey`\r\n- `nifi.security.keystore.certificate`\r\n\r\nConfiguring `PEM` for `nifi.security.truststoreType` requires setting the following property:\r\n\r\n- `nifi.security.truststore.certificate`\r\n\r\nThe Administrator's Guide describes the new properties and supported values.\r\n\r\nThe new `certificate` properties support one or more X.509 certificates, separated with newlines, having a `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` header and an `END CERTIFICATE` footer for each certificate included.\r\n\r\nThe new `privateKey` property supports RSA Private Keys encoded according to [RFC 8017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8017#appendix-A.1.2) having a `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY` header and an `END RSA PRIVATE KEY` footer. The `privateKey` property also supports private keys encoded according to [RFC 5958](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5958) having a `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY` header and an `END PRIVATE KEY` footer. PKCS8 private key support includes the following key algorithms:\r\n\r\n- ECDSA with NIST curves P-256, P-384, or P-521 as described in [RFC 5915 Section 3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5915#section-3)\r\n- Ed25519 as described in [RFC 8410 Section 10.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8410#section-10.3)\r\n- RSA as described in [RFC 8017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8017#appendix-A.1.2)\r\n\r\nThe PEM parsing is implemented in the `nifi-security-ssl` module using standard Java security classes without any external dependencies.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14005](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14005) - Support Custom Content from External File in GenerateFlowFile\r\n\r\nAdd a property in GenerateFlowFile allowing the user to specify a local path to an external file. If specified the content of the external file will be used as content of the generated flow files.\r\n\r\nThis makes things easier compared to a GetFile for example. Besides, coupled with the Asset feature, it makes it easy to load a test dataset as content for GenerateFlowFile processor in a cloud native environment (container based).\r\n\r\n#
