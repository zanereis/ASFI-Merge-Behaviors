Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes the update count when Gluon trainer is created with multiple devices and `update_on_kvstore=False`.\r\nFixes #13752, fixes #12713\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin This slightly hacky but should work for all cases. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The real fix here should be moving the _index_update_count to Updater (which is per device) from optimizer (which is common to all updaters), but that would require breaking API change.

This should fix those known issues.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate on the ResourceScope issue: there are some times when classes such as Executor creates other NativeResources (usually NDArrays) after the Executor has been instantiated. The executor then has a dependency on that new NativeResource. Since these happen at different times, they could potentially be created at different ResourceScope levels. The result is an unstable state where exiting the scope would cause a crash. Fixed this by adding a method to NativeResource which allows moving a resource to the same scope as another. This allows the parent class to control the scope of their dependencies.\r\n\r\nResolves #10867, and resolves #14080.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

#13951 Fixes #14358 \r\n\r\nFor size-zero ndarray (e.g. mx.nd.array([]), mx.nd.ones(0)), the storage handle size is 0. Currently we only free handles which size is larger than 0. This leads to memory leak for size-zero ndarray.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we remove the check on storage handle size which was used to decide if we need to free a storage handle. After relaxing the check, we need to make sure nullptr is not reused in pooled storage manager and the context for aux handle is correctly set for sparse ndarray. \r\n\r\nWith this PR, the memory leak issues mentioned above are fixed.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-08T04:02:08Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T20:44:30Z","closed_at":"2019-03-18T20:43:26Z","merged_at":"2019-03-18T20:43:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ab1decd56563e20fefb5f3f8893abbab26f9cbf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support multi-threading for Custom Operator\r\n- [x] Add environmental variable `MXNET_CUSTOM_OP_NUM_THREADS`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-08T03:42:37Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T05:45:24Z","closed_at":"2019-03-15T02:16:26Z","merged_at":"2019-03-15T02:16:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"74c227402ef0a9c7d227368aafea55f0c1d28311","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

PR is implemented based upon the discussion with @eric-haibin-lin. It provides two APIs and NumPy-compatible NDArray indexing behavior, i.e. `y = x[i]`.\r\n\r\n1. `set_numpy_comp(enable)`\r\nThis is a thread-safe utility function for users to enable or disable NumPy-compatible behaviors in MXNet. This will generally affect the behavior of the following two operations:\r\n    1. NDArray indexing. When `enable=False`, NDArray indexing always returns a tensor with `ndim >= 1`, which is the default behavior of MXNet kept for backward compatibility. When `enable=True`, NDArray indexing will return a tensor with `ndim >= 0`, which is consistent with NumPy's indexing behavior. The result tensor with `ndim = 0` is actually a scalar whose shape is `()`. For example:\r\n\r\n    >>> from mxnet.base import set_numpy_comp\r\n    >>> x = mx.nd.arange(6)\r\n    >>> x\r\n    [0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.]\r\n    <NDArray 6 @cpu(0)>\r\n    >>> x[1]\r\n    [1.]\r\n    <NDArray 1 @cpu(0)>\r\n    >>> set_numpy_comp(enable=True)\r\n    >>> x[1]\r\n    1.0\r\n    <NDArray  @cpu(0)>\r\n    >>> set_numpy_comp(enable=False)\r\n    >>> x[1]\r\n    [1.]\r\n    <NDArray 1 @cpu(0)>\r\n\r\n    \r\n    2. NDArray's convenience fluent methods. When `enable=True`, the convenience fluent methods will dispatch the calls to NumPy operators if implemented in MXNet. For example, given an NDArray `data`, `data.sum()` will call `mxnet.ndarray.sum(data)` when `enable=False` (default behavior), and mxnet.numpy.sum(data)` when `enable=True`.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. `_is_numpy_comp()`\r\nThis is a thread-safe utility function for checking whether NumPy-compatibility has been enabled or disabled. This is implemented for developers to use. Users are not expected to call this function.\r\n\r\n@junrushao1994 @eric-haibin-lin @szha @zheng-da @yzhliu

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nFixes #13862 \r\nUsing \"-1\" for the leading shape dimension was not officially documented but happened to work in versions 1.3.1 or lower as mshadow::index_t  was unsigned so -1 was eventually interpreted as maxint. In subsequent versions of mxnet, mshadow::index_t has been changed to a signed type such that using -1 as leading shape dimension did not work anymore.\r\nThis fix documents that -1 is an allowed value for the leading dimension and re-enable behaviour of version 1.3.1.  Note that it is natural to assume that this use case is supported as the value of the leading dimension of the shape is not needed for ravel/unravel computations anyway. Also it seems from above issue, that there are valid customer use cases that need support for this. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-07T09:48:30Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T08:44:11Z","closed_at":"2019-03-11T03:53:31Z","merged_at":"2019-03-11T03:53:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"35098b8ad27e5151fc266fbf1a766d937bd9ec8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR changes the `batch_start` calculation in the BoxNMSForward op to the custom kernel, much faster than the mshadow generated one. In MaskRCNN model it changes the runtime of that part from 20 ms to 2 us, speeding up the single GPU training by 20% in fp16 mode.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- I'm pretty sure that on a CPU path a simple for loop would be much better than the mshadow generated kernel as well, but since I did not have experimental data, I did not change it.

Description ##\r\nAdding AlexNet, ResNet and FCN examples for the Gluon fit() API.\r\nThis PR depends on its parent PR #14346 \r\nJIRA epic: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-1333\r\n\r\nUsing the fit() API reduces the number of lines of code in each example from ~40 to ~10\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-1348](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-1348)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added AlexNet, ResNet and FCN examples for fit() API\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-06T22:09:00Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T17:41:21Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T17:41:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"610f24d16addf20eab3c9385410c4070083c6df5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds Text Sentiment Classification examples using Gluon fit() API. This PR depends on its parent PR([14346](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14346)).\r\n\r\nJIRA epic can be found here: <https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-1335>\r\n\r\nThe examples has been modified from D2L Gluon [book](http://d2l.ai/chapter_natural-language-processing/index.html). This examples shows that the fit() API helps in reducing the training script by approx. 25 lines, and also the target users doesn't need to write their own training loop.\r\n\r\nNote: We have covered some of the models, more to be added soon.  \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-1335](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-1335)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis is the first PR for the Gluon Fit API proposed here:  [Gluon Fit API tech design](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Gluon+Fit+API+-+Tech+Design)\r\n\r\nIt add base classes for estimator and eventhandlers, and an example.  We would like to merge into fit-api branch so other controbutors can work on top of it before making it available on master branch.\r\n\r\nJIRA epic can be found here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1333\r\nWe are separating this into a few PRs, all tracked by JIRA issues under the epic.\r\n\r\nWe will open follow up PRs for the following tasks:\r\n1.  CNN and RNN examples using the fit API https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14350\r\n2. User experience improvement on initialization, context management, and hybridization\r\n3. More eventhandlers like Checkpoint, early stopping. \r\n4. Multi output support for Multi-task and SSD use cases and examples\r\n5. Multi trainer support for encoder decoder and neural machine translation example.\r\n6. Unit tests and integration tests \r\n7. Documentation \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-1334](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1334) created\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n1. Base class for estimator with fit method\r\n2. Base class for event handlers\r\n3. simple cnn example on mnist dataset\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@ankkhedia

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-06T10:04:07Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T08:00:15Z","closed_at":"2019-03-14T08:00:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"037fa9124fe6a66214e75a795dd22e06ada0f7f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nPer discussion with @szha, this PR stabilizes the CI by eliminating errors in test_operator_gpu.py:test_convolution_multiple_streams that began with the merging of the subsequent PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14223.  The segfaults and python double-free aborts currently seen in this test only appear when run with MXNET_ENGINE_TYPE=ThreadedEngine (which uses the ThreadedEnginePooled class).  It is hoped that @arcadiaphy will submit a follow-up PR to enable his improvements to run under the ThreadedEngine.\r\n\r\nThe test being modified was introduced by https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14006.\r\n\r\nThis a the first step to resolving https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14329.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-06T00:05:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T03:30:21Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T03:29:27Z","merged_at":"2019-03-06T03:29:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"d6eafca2555b58746f51052fdce96a264d02a84a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM1ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Flaky","name":"Flaky","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Fixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14265\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nCurrently there is a bug in the way Optimizer is trying to serialize state which fails when trying to deserialize Optimizer that has no `states` (like SGD without momentum).\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nCurrently the way serialize is being done is as below: (pasting Optimizer.serailizeState())\r\n```scala\r\n  override def serializeState(): Array[Byte] = {\r\n        val bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream()\r\n        try {\r\n          val out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos)\r\n          out.writeInt(states.size)\r\n          states.foreach { case (k, v) =>\r\n            if (v != null) {\r\n              out.writeInt(k)\r\n              val stateBytes = optimizer.serializeState(v)\r\n              if (stateBytes == null) {\r\n                out.writeInt(0)\r\n              } else {\r\n                out.writeInt(stateBytes.length)\r\n                out.write(stateBytes)\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n          out.flush()\r\n          bos.toByteArray\r\n        } finally {\r\n         ...\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWhen an Optimizer without `states` like SGD with momentum set as `0` is being used. The `states` map (`Map[Int, AnyRef]`) contains a (key, value) pair as (`some integer index`, `null`).\r\n\r\nThe above serialize method does not write `k` as the value of `key` and `0` as the value of `stateBytes`, due to the null check `if (v != null)`\r\n\r\nNow while deserializing: (Pasting code from Optimizer.deserializeState())\r\n```scala\r\n  override def deserializeState(bytes: Array[Byte]): Unit = {\r\n        val bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes)\r\n        var in: ObjectInputStream = null\r\n        try {\r\n          in = new ObjectInputStream(bis)\r\n          val size = in.readInt()\r\n          (0 until size).foreach(_ => {\r\n            val key = in.readInt()\r\n            val bytesLength = in.readInt()\r\n            val value =\r\n              if (bytesLength > 0) {\r\n                val bytes = Array.fill[Byte](bytesLength)(0)\r\n                in.readFully(bytes)\r\n                optimizer.deserializeState(bytes)\r\n              } else {\r\n                null\r\n              }\r\n            states.update(key, value)\r\n          })\r\n        } finally {\r\n          ...\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIn the `foreach` loop, the key is being read (which wasn't serialized previously) hence, this would cause an `java.io.EOFException`.\r\n\r\n## Solution.\r\n\r\nGet rid of `if (v != null)` check and retain the

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nHi! there.\r\nI think it is necessary to print error message for mxnet::cpp::Operator::Invoke when there are some mistakes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] tiny change. The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Check return value of `MXImperativeInvoke`, and print error message if it exists.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-04T14:46:26Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T04:53:28Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T04:53:27Z","merged_at":"2019-03-07T04:53:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"6caaa38bdad5452e2872f382a7e61f173f9a0a6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":273991937,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzM5OTE5Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/C++","name":"C++","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Related

Description ##\r\nThis PR made necessary changes in the shape-related infra code to support scalars, aka, zero-dim tensors. \r\nSee this [RFC](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14253) for more information.\r\n\r\nImplemented `np.sum` to verify the correctness with the following script.\r\n\r\nAfter merging this PR, we can get started to make all the existing infer shape functions accommodate the new definition of empty shapes. Implementation of NumPy operators can be carried out in parallel.\r\n\r\nNote that before we change all the existing infer functions to accommodate the new empty shape definition, the CI will fail without surprise. When we work on specific operators, we can test those locally to verify the correctness and submit PRs. After all the infer functions are revised, the CI should pass eventually. Then, we can merge the dev branch to the master.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet import numpy as np\r\n\r\n\r\nshape = (2, 2)\r\nret =

Description ##\r\nTo compatible with multiple versions of OpenCV, define the old OpenCV macros to support OpenCV4.\r\n\r\nIn OpenCV4, `opencv2/imgproc/imgproc_c.h` and `opencv2/videoio/videoio_c.h` define these macros, however I couldn't include them since it would bring redefinition problems.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add a new file `src/io/opencv_compatibility.h` to define the OpenCV macros.\r\n- [x] Modify `Makefile` to find the path of `opencv4`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThere is a similar PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13559, Thank @daleydeng\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-04T02:33:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-14T00:42:18Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T02:10:03Z","merged_at":"2019-03-07T02:10:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b8e3a9685a668d216f1c594b34ee614373f4216","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nfix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13332\r\nif data is on cpu and module is built on gpu, copy data to gpu and do prediction. \r\ngive user warnings if data and module context are different.\r\n\r\nAdded test cases reported in issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13332\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-1332], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [MXNet-1332](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1332) created \r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n1. copy data from cpu to gpu only when single device\r\n2. give warnings when data and module context are different.\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-04T01:57:48Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T16:52:23Z","closed_at":"2019-04-10T16:52:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9b3e1d8522aae82821a130bcc7ceb234f1651b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":770413511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NzA0MTM1MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Module","name":"Module","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nI've learned that for cudnn versions in the range [7.3.1,7.5.0), the Convolution dgrad algorithm 3 (CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_BWD_DATA_ALGO_FFT_TILING) may produce incorrect results for some strided convolutions.  This is not something that would generally appear in the current CI, which builds against cuda9.1 and cudnn7.1(so before the problem was introduced).\r\n\r\nI've created a test to expose the problem, as well as a fix.  I've noticed that there is a CI build for tensorrt that uses cuda10.0 and cudnn7.4, which should exhibit the problem.  Thus, the plan is:\r\n\r\n- Do an initial PR submission that includes the problem-exposing test, and with a temporary addition of that test to the tensorrt CI test suite.\r\n- If hopefully this demonstrates the problem, then push the fix (which involves filtering-out algo 3 from the results of cudnnFind when necessary).\r\n- When the fix is shown to work, remove the explicit running of the test from the tensorrt CI, allowing the normal running of the test as part of test_operator_gpu.py to catch any return of the problem.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-03T23:46:41Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T19:17:06Z","closed_at":"2019-03-13T19:17:06Z","merged_at":"2019-03-13T19:17:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"ce99e49e86ee5f187a3d8cc6b029a71652a53af4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nFix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14301\r\n\r\nIt seems that `BackwardResource` in `src/operator/softmax_output-inl.h` is not used in SoftmaxOutput since it is not a legacy operator.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Tiny change. The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Remove `BackwardResource` in `src/operator/softmax_output-inl.h`\r\n- [x] Add `ResourceRequest` in  `src/operator/softmax_output.cc`\r\n- [x] Add the testcase for SoftmaxOutput.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n`SoftmaxOutput` is not a legacy operator, which is registered by `NNVM_REGISTER_OP` rather than `MXNET_REGISTER_OP_PROPERTY`, so `BackwardResource` is not used for it.\r\nMeanwhile, I check all operators. Only `SoftmaxOutput` has the

Description ##\r\nCurrent Box NMS forward path is very slow on the GPU, because it launches potentially thousands very tiny kernels with exposed launch latency. This PR introduces a new kernel for this slow part of the NMS op, reducing the time significantly.\r\n\r\nOn single GPU, training Faster RCNN from GluonCV model zoo, the time to perform this portion of NMS improved by 50x, from 100 ms to 2.1 ms.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] GPU path of Box NMS forward op changed from previous nms_impl kernel to the new optimized kernel \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- While this was the biggest problem with NMS op, there are other ones, now exposed because the biggest offender got significantly faster. Namely: using thrust for sorting introduces syncs, allocations and deallocations in the op; there are 2 Slice operations that in the case of FRCNN take together ~18ms (which is 20% of the end to end time in FP16 training). I don't have time currently to try to fix them though :-(.  @zhreshold

Description ##\r\nchange success_rate to 0.20 for test_exponential_generator since 0.25 much stricter and fails random exponential generator tests.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Testing ##\r\nCommand:\r\nubuntu@ip-172-31-82-110 ~/Workspace/mxnet/tests/python/unittest (master) $ MXNET_TEST_COUNT=10000 nosetests --logging-level=DEBUG

with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-28T02:24:45Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T07:20:18Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T07:20:18Z","merged_at":"2019-03-06T07:20:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"b48659429ff15eeea9aeb9055b6b27527c2d108f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR is the initial part of efforts for the numpy module of MXNet #14253, in which we bring nnvm's Tuple and TShape into MXNet for all further changes to happen locally in MXNet. See the section \"Changes\" for details.\r\n\r\nTest coverage is ensured automatically ensured by our CI pipeline, because this PR is checked by all testcases related to any NDArray's shape.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Bring nnvm::Tuple to mxnet::Tuple\r\n- [x] Bring nnvm's passes into MXNet, including MXGradient, MXPlanMemory\r\n- [x] Refactor the code a little bit by explicitly requiring \"mxnet::\" prefix, and using the alias \"mxnet::ShapeVector\" instead of \"std::vector<TShape>\".\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Thanks @reminisce for great

Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nMake sym.arange documentation consistent with that of nd.arange and np.arange. @icemelon9\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-22T21:07:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-02T23:35:49Z","closed_at":"2019-03-12T03:29:18Z","merged_at":"2019-03-12T03:29:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"89bebd1f9395331ea3e27a83775e24fb0526df66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

Description ##\r\nContinuing the discussion in #14176, this PR fixes memory-related issues detected by ASAN:\r\n1. DeleteVar operations are still executed in engine shutdown phase to cleanup memory\r\n2. Mark DeleteOperator as DeleteVar\r\n3. Uncomment free operation in object pool\r\n4. Free unreleased pointers of executer and optimizer in cpp examples\r\n5. Fix heap overflow in classification example\r\n\r\nCurrently [ASAN tests](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/ci/docker/runtime_functions.sh#L1032) is non blocking, after this PR, the checks are green.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-21T11:52:42Z","updated_at":"2019-03-03T05:39:29Z","closed_at":"2019-03-03T04:37:12Z","merged_at":"2019-03-03T04:37:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"053ffc7f8f7eb085bfefb66749b5938f944844df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":764928544,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NjQ5Mjg1NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Memory","name":"Memory","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n#14171 broke backward compatibility that rescale_grad no longer supports scalar values. This PR adds it back. @szha \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-20T21:00:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T22:28:50Z","closed_at":"2019-02-28T21:14:20Z","merged_at":"2019-02-28T21:14:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"c319ae570c1cfdd01e0349dbdb77d7774e28c98e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1085340072,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg1MzQwMDcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Java","name":"Java","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Label

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in `slice_like` operator, where, if the first input is constant, the backward pass of this operator would not fill the gradient to the second input with zeros, instead passing random memory contents.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Moved the handling of the second input before the early exit for the first input\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This issue was encountered while working with GluonCV's SSD model, where `slice_like` is used in anchor generator (https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv/blob/master/gluoncv/model_zoo/ssd/anchor.py#L70):\r\n```\r\na = F.slice_like(anchors, x * 0, axes=(2, 3))\r\n```\r\nwhere the work around was to multiply the second input by 0 (effectively zeroing the gradient). With this PR, this work around is not needed anymore (and it is also not fully safe - NaNs and Infs in the memory returned from SliceLikeBackward would produce NaNs when multiplied by 0 and so would still break the training). @zhreshold FYI\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin

Description ##\r\nThis is very much a work in progress (WIP).\r\n\r\nI am trying to add support for variable length LSTMs in MxNet, and need help with someone to help me complete the PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR currently adds support for variable length sequences using the built-in support of that by cuDNN. It currently does not add CPU support but probably should.\r\n\r\nI had to make a few changes to get it working that definitely need to change before we think about merging:\r\n  1) I changed the way gluon handles kwargs to model blocks. Originally I did this because I thought I needed to pass in `use_sequence_length=True, sequence_length=sequence_length` the way the current SequenceLast/SequenceReverse/etc operators do. Now I think I probably don't need this since I moved the use_sequence_length parameter to the constructor.   (Although perhaps we don't need this at all? it seems clunky to me, but I was trying to follow existing conventions).\r\n\r\n  2) Currently I hard-coded the `F.RNN` call in rnn_layer.py to look like: `.RNN(inputs, params, states[0], states[1], sequence_length, ...` because this was giving me python syntax errors:  `.RNN(inputs, params, *states, sequence_length,...`\r\n\r\n  3) optimizer.py had a bunch of imports that were failing for me (e.g. `multi_sgd_update`). Are they not failing for everyone else? Not sure why they just failed for me, but I had to remove to get my test script to run.\r\n\r\n  4) I had to modify imperative_utils.h to temporarily remove the check that all ndarrays are on the same context, because cudnn expects the sequence length array to live on the CPu.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill need to add unit tests to test this feature. currently I am using the following test script:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/stephenrawls/8a4f4cb941f0c3f32bf5a8b3b12d32c0\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it looks like the test I have is failing. Not sure why might need help from cudnn guys to help track down.\r\n\r\nI have tested with cudnn v7.4.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here","created_at":"2019-02-19T21:52:39Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T20:52:10Z","closed_at":"2019-05-07T20:52:10Z","merged_at":"2019-05-07T20:52:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"527573ec2b9b2696ffcafd1570cd94e2187f4c32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":775221378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NzUyMjEzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/RNN","name":"RNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Description ##\r\nThis is the beginning of a serial of PRs for improving the tutorials of MKL-DNN backend, including installation, design, usage, quantization, performance faq, etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR moved the MKLDNN_README file from root folder to the new tutorial folder and fixed some links according to the change.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-19T09:48:34Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T10:03:49Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T05:36:07Z","merged_at":"2019-03-19T05:36:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"c56c14658daa650090377501d01e2606f4702e1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":718413113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MTg0MTMxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Example","name":"Example","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nBackground: Operators are bulked into segments that define synchronization points between the cpu-based worker threads and the often-GPU-based operator execution.  While the default size of the segments is set to 15, in practice the segment size is much smaller due to the current restriction that 'Variable' nodes (e.g. weight inputs to Convolution) terminate the segment formation.  This is an unnecessary restriction that can be removed to increase segment size and improve performance.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the operator bulking code to allow Variable nodes to be part of the segment, but does not count them toward the limit, which is set currently by the environment variable MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_MAX_NODE_TRAIN (default = 15).  Larger segments are desirable to improve both CPU and GPU efficiency.  However, there are practical considerations that keep full forward- and backward-pass bulking from being the optimal.  For example, generated gradients of the backward pass must wait until the end of a segment before gradient reduction can get started in a multi-GPU training scenario.  Because of the possible different optima in the forward and backward pass, this PR adds 2 additional environment variable 'knobs':\r\n\r\nMXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_MAX_NODE_TRAIN_FWD - sets the maximum size of bulked operator segments in the forward pass.  If unset, then MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_MAX_NODE_TRAIN is used, or if that is similarly unset, the default of 15.\r\n\r\nMXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_MAX_NODE_TRAIN_BWD - sets the maximum size of bulked operator segments in the backward pass.  If unset, then MXNET_EXEC_BULK_EXEC_MAX_NODE_TRAIN is used, or if that is similarly unset, the default of 15.\r\n\r\nWhile this PR is being reviewed, I will make a further post detailing the performance gains that result.  Also due is a commit that adds documentation for the additional environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR.  Documentation update still pending.) \r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage: In effect the entire CI now runs with the larger segments.\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\n\r\n- This PR generates new methods based on the newer NDArrayAPI and SymbolAPI.\r\n- It uses the scala's `Base/_LIB` with direct access to JNI in order to generate the ndarray and symbol methods along with named arguments and documentation. Although the current PR doesn't add specs these can be added over time.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] NDArrayAPI methods, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [x] SymbolAPI methods, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n### Reviewers ###\r\n\r\n@gigasquid

Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces another way of executing a graph, `NaiveRunGraph`, which runs the operators one by another. This is part of effort of enabling dynamic shapes inside a CahcedOp. Since the output shape of operators coundn't be determined ahead of time, we have to run these operators one at a time.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add a `NaiveForward` pass.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Since it is only used in dynamic shape, this won't cause performance regression.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-18T19:17:31Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T02:10:17Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T19:01:30Z","merged_at":"2019-03-06T19:01:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"83d2c2d0e0edeb7d85471437601efcf8bebf070e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

[x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-18T09:22:24Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T05:35:01Z","closed_at":"2019-03-05T05:35:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a953d20ad78a032f43af98ca708b00263bed29d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM1ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Flaky","name":"Flaky","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdd quantization examples to example/readme\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-18T07:50:16Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T18:57:23Z","closed_at":"2019-02-18T18:57:23Z","merged_at":"2019-02-18T18:57:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"bada8a1961f0da7f01cd9e61d03f280c48083f1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review
