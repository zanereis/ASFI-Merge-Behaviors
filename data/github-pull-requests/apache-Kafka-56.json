The specific tests are:\r\n* validate put, get, get-with-timestamp, and delete operations\r\n* changelog topic configs are as expected\r\n* restore from changelog\r\n* custom IQv2 queries to a custom store implementation\r\n* versioned store as global store\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains a small bugfix for the restore record converter, required to get the tests above to pass: even though versioned stores are timestamped stores, we do not want to use the record converter for prepending timestamps when restoring a versioned store.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

PR refactors MetadataPublisher's interface a bit. There is now a handleControllerChange callback. This is something that some publishers might want. A good example is ZkMigrationClient.\r\n\r\nThere is now only a single publish() function rather than a separate function for publishing snapshots and log deltas. Most publishers didn't want to do anything different in those two cases. The ones that do want to do something different for snapshots can always check the manifest type.\r\n\r\nThe close function now has a default empty implementation, since most publishers didn't need to do anything there.","created_at":"2023-03-03T19:13:47Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T22:52:45Z","closed_at":"2023-03-09T22:52:40Z","merged_at":"2023-03-09T22:52:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"aaa976a3409f61e1e65ed49742567c08a502d9e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f9f07ee4f08076194ef9b3df5859d5698c6fe6a0","head":{"label":"cmccabe:cmccabe_2023-03-03_refactor_metadatapublisher","ref":"cmccabe_2023-03-03_refactor_metadatapublisher","sha":"f9f07ee4f08076194ef9b3df5859d5698c6fe6a0","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

class has a circular classloading dependency that causes an NPE if TestPlugins.TestPlugin is loaded before TestPlugins. This was introduced in #13182 but does not impact the build because all call-sites load TestPlugins first.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, that PR also included some unnecessary duplication that was the result of an earlier design decision in this class. Instead, we factor out a TestPackage enum, with one value corresponding to each test plugin directory, compile, and packaging step. The TestPlugin enum remains one-to-one with each plugin class and the tests are unchanged.\r\n\r\nFinally address some intelliJ warnings for code verbosity and resource leaks.\r\n\r\n### Committer

PR allows us to dynamically reconfigure the KRaft controller by setting either a cluster configuration (that is, a configuration that applies to all resource of type BROKER), or by configuring a combined broker/controller node.\r\n\r\nAs described in DynamicBrokerConfig#addReconfigurables(ControllerServer), we currently support reconfiguring Yammer metrics, metrics reporters, the socket server, and the Authorizer.  More dynamically reconfigurable Controller elements will be added later.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors MetadataPublisher's interface a bit. There is now a handleControllerChange callback. This is something that some publishers might want (a good example is ZkMigrationClient). There is now only a single publish() function rather than a separate function for publishing snapshots and log deltas. Most publishers didn't want to do anything different in those two cases. The ones that do want to do something different for snapshots can always check the manifest type. The close function now has a default empty implementation, since most publishers didn't need to do anything there.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where the KRaft broker's authorizer was not dynamically reconfigurable even if it had implemented Reconfigurable. The bug resulted from the fact that we called DynamicBrokerConfig.addReconfigurables prior to initializing BrokerServer.authorizer.","created_at":"2023-03-02T23:53:11Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T22:25:46Z","closed_at":"2023-03-07T22:25:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f6994a24ed4052d6c64a2a92def3496e154c3b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c5f1388f0e9a036fa37aa80298bf8a4e28c82e9c","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-14057","ref":"KAFKA-14057","sha":"c5f1388f0e9a036fa37aa80298bf8a4e28c82e9c","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR has two fixes for fault handling. One makes fault handling more strict on the controller; the other makes it a bit less strict on the (ZK-based) broker.\r\n\r\nIn ControllerServer, invoke a fatal fault handler in the catch block of the ControllerServer.startup() function. This will protect us from cases where unwinding startup would otherwise encounter a deadlock, or be too slow.  This is the same reason why we made controller fault handlers call halt() instead of exit() in KAFKA-14693.  In a sense, this JIRA is a continuation of that fix since it turns some cases that would previously have been handled by calling shutdown() into cases where we invoke a fault handler which will call halt() directly.\r\n\r\nIn KafkaServer,  when we are in migration-from-zk mode and we create a RaftManager, it should have a fault handler which simply calls shutdown() on the broker rather than invoking\r\nProcessTerminatingFaultHandler. This fixes the bug where we could invoke the process terminating fault handler from junit tests.","created_at":"2023-03-02T22:02:03Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T19:23:43Z","closed_at":"2023-03-06T19:23:38Z","merged_at":"2023-03-06T19:23:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"9407b842bd69a47e54776581932950039d5df4fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/a16e225599cc5248333626dfe9efcea24583fc92","head":{"label":"cmccabe:cmccabe_2023-03-02_fix_fault_handling","ref":"cmccabe_2023-03-02_fix_fault_handling","sha":"a16e225599cc5248333626dfe9efcea24583fc92","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

Team:\r\n\r\nNice to meet you. Refer to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14768\r\n\r\n**Issues**\r\nThere are two issues for current's producer we had encountered in our service:\r\n(1) Take much time to send the first record (such as after deploy/restart) due to metadata fetching. BTW: It is not bug but it \r\n causes our customer don't always to get bad experience after restart server.\r\n(2) We hope we can reduce the time(max.block.ms) to avoid the caller's thread blocked a long time when sending records in any case. Thus, we can't reduce the send message's block time (max.block.ms) to wanted lower value. The reason is that we should worry about the cost time for metadata fetch in doSend's process. The time is counted as part of max.block.ms. Thus, the metadata fetch only happens one time when sending. (other's fetch is asynced in network thread)\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nSo, I propose this PR to add one method (getCluster() which will fetch metadata with another time parameter control) to provide possibility for warming up first record's sending and reducing the max.block.ms safely. \r\n\r\nUser can call the method getCluster() (which will get metadata) before marking the service is ready. Then the first time's record sending will only take much less time. What's more, we can reduce the max.block.ms a lot now.\r\n\r\n**Test Result:**\r\nAt the beginning of the change, we will take 4s+ to send one message due to get metadata take > 4s and we also must make sure max.block.ms > 4s. After the change:\r\n(1) reduce time for first record's sending:  my example: it will reduce at least 4s.\r\n_warmup test_topic at phase phase 2: get metadata from kafka start\r\nwarmup test_topic at phase phase 2: get metadata from kafka end consume 4669ms_\r\n(2) can reduce max.block.ms to < 4s now. Any issue won't hang our thread a lot of time.\r\n\r\nWDYT? thanks\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

Fix the StateUpdater shutdown procedure: a) in shutdown, we first set the running flag, then notify the condition; 2) in the thread's `waitIfAllChangelogsCompletelyRead` block, we collapse the `if` condition together with the `while` condition so that we always check all four conditions once the thread is notified inside the while loop. As a result, shutdown procedure would not involve any thread interruptions anymore.\r\n2. Print fine-grained streams exception when list-offset fails, this is a byproduct of the debugging procedure but I think it's worth keeping since it has better operational visibilities.\r\n3. Some nit logging improvements (including moving `logger` from the inner thread into the outer class to also add some more logging).\r\n4. Re-enable state-updater in SmokeTestDriverIntegrationTest\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

problem with the following location: '/Users/ijuma/src/kafka/storage/src/generated/java'.\r\n\r\n    Reason: Task ':storage:srcJar' uses this output of task ':storage:processMessages' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency. This can lead to incorrect results being produced, depending on what order the tasks are executed.\r\n\r\n    Possible solutions:\r\n      1. Declare task ':storage:processMessages' as an input of ':storage:srcJar'.\r\n      2. Declare an explicit dependency on ':storage:processMessages' from ':storage:srcJar' using Task#dependsOn.\r\n      3. Declare an explicit dependency on ':storage:processMessages' from ':storage:srcJar' using Task#mustRunAfter.\r\n\r\n    Please refer to

connect-runtime pulls in tools as a dependency in order to use the ThroughputThrottler.\r\nIn the future it will be desirable to have tools pull in connect-runtime as a (test) dependency, so we must remove this dependency first.\r\n\r\nThe last time this was tried (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2752) it broke system tests and had to be reverted (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2807).\r\n\r\nThis was because the `dev` version of tools was being used with `0.8.2.x` clients jar in the system tests, because the test needs the VerifiableProducer which did not exist in `0.8.2.x`. In order to work around this restriction, this PR changes the system test to use the `0.9.x` version of tools with `0.8.2.x` instead of the dev version. This will relax the current compatibility requirement between tools and clients, and should allow this refactor to land without the upgrade test failing.\r\n\r\nThis conflicts with #13302 which move some of the classes which depend on `tools`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Motivation\r\nReading/writing the protocol buffer varInt32 and varInt64 (also called varLong in our code base) is in the hot path of data plane code in Apache Kafka. We read multiple varInt in a record and in long. Hence, even a minor change in performance could extrapolate to larger performance benefit.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we only update varInt32 encoding/decoding. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\nThis change uses loop unrolling and reduces the amount of repetition of calculations. Based on the empirical results from the benchmark, the code has been modified to pick up the best implementation.\r\n\r\n# Results\r\nPerformance has been evaluated using JMH benchmarks on JDK 17.0.6. Various implementations have been added in the benchmark and benchmarking has been done for different sizes of varints and varlongs. The benchmark for various implementations have been added at ByteUtilsBenchmark.java \r\n\r\nIntel architecture JDK 17\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                            (numNonZeroBytes)   Mode  Cnt      Score     Error  Units\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarintLegacy                      1  thrpt   10   5981.674 ±  23.685  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarintLegacy                      2  thrpt   10   5260.723 ±  20.884  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarintLegacy                      3  thrpt   10   4683.609 ±  11.270  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarintNetty                       1  thrpt   10   6062.083 ± 272.165  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarintNetty                       2  thrpt   10   5996.124 ±  29.439  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarintNetty                       3  thrpt   10   5391.487 ±  69.063  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarintProtobuf                    1  thrpt   10   5419.259 ±  76.163  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarintProtobuf                    2  thrpt   10   4968.035 ±  17.256  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarintProtobuf                    3  thrpt   10   4396.969 ±   9.326  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarlongLegacy                     1  thrpt   10   5846.883 ±  21.567  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarlongLegacy                     3  thrpt   10   4376.479 ±   7.852  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarlongLegacy                     5  thrpt   10   3191.882 ±   1.203  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarlongLegacy                     7  thrpt   10   2460.615 ±   1.635  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarlongUnrolled                   1  thrpt   10   5766.874 ±  30.694  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarlongUnrolled                   3  thrpt   10   5381.062 ± 120.718  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarlongUnrolled                   5  thrpt   10   4060.916 ±  59.091  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedReadVarlongUnrolled                   7  thrpt   10   3313.503 ±  36.213  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarintLegacy                     1  thrpt   10   7950.731 ± 225.341  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarintLegacy                     2  thrpt   10   7272.522 ±  30.879  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarintLegacy                     3  thrpt   10   6603.134 ±  20.163  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarintUnrolled                   1  thrpt   10   9995.273 ± 432.243  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarintUnrolled                   2  thrpt   10  10354.524 ± 116.185  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarintUnrolled                   3  thrpt   10   9801.351 ± 171.096  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarlongLegacy                    1  thrpt   10   7390.169 ±  74.946  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarlongLegacy                    3  thrpt   10   6402.276 ±  96.414  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarlongLegacy                    5  thrpt   10   5415.768 ±   5.733  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarlongLegacy                    7  thrpt   10   4350.428 ±   7.111  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarlongUnrolled                  1  thrpt   10   9836.835 ± 123.154  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarlongUnrolled                  3  thrpt   10   9186.913 ± 162.985  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarlongUnrolled                  5  thrpt   10   7189.661 ±  13.338  ops/s\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testUnsignedWriteVarlongUnrolled                  7  thrpt   10   5858.306 ±   3.047  ops/s\r\n```\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-04 at 14 27 06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71267/229791499-f48f104a-2c8c-4143-80a9-8ffe653845e3.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-04 at 14 27 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71267/229791529-0c6c5d1d-8a92-4e11-a252-804a305dceb3.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-04 at 14 27 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71267/229791557-909d6f82-46b6-47c7-92eb-3463dbeaa6f1.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-04 at 14 27 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71267/229791583-693f5774-e304-4381-a556-ed3ecd114f29.png)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nNew tests have been added which validate that the value produced by prior algorithm is same as new algorithm.

Motivation\r\nThe current implementation of the benchmark may produce different set of integers across benchmarks and hence, may not provide apples to apples comparison.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n1. With this change, we initialize random number generator with a fixed seed at the start of a benchmark. This ensures that for each benchmark, random number generator produces the same sequence of random values. Hence, the input data across benchmarks would be consistent providing a reliable apples to apples comparison.\r\n2. We ensure that a new set of random numbers are generated per iteration, so that the bechmark calculation is performed over a diverse range of values\r\n\r\nSample result of a benchmark run:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                           Mode  Cnt     Score   Error  Units\r\nByteUtilsBenchmark.testSizeOfUnsignedVarint        thrpt   30  1302.193 ± 0.396

refactoring the OffsetFetch handling in KafkaApis, we introduced a NullPointerException (NPE). The NPE arises when the FetchOffset API is called with a client using a version older than version 8 and using null for the topics to signal that all topic-partition offsets must be returned. This means that this bug mainly impacts admin tools. The consumer does not use null.\r\n\r\nThis NPE is here: https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/24a86423e9907b751d98fddc7196332feea2b48d#diff-0f2f19fd03e2fc5aa9618c607b432ea72e5aaa53866f07444269f38cb537f3feR237.\r\n\r\nWe missed this during the refactor because we had no tests in place to test this mode.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

PR sets the correct topic configs for changelog topics for versioned stores introduced in [KIP-889](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-889%3A+Versioned+State+Stores). Changelog topics for versioned stores differ from those for non-versioned stores only in that `min.compaction.lag.ms` needs to be set in order to prevent version history from being compacted prematurely. \r\n\r\nThe value for `min.compaction.lag.ms` is equal to the store's history retention plus some buffer to account for the broker's use of wall-clock time in performing compactions. This buffer is analogous to the `windowstore.changelog.additional.retention.ms` value for window store changelog topic retention time, and uses the same default of 24 hours. In the future, we can propose a KIP to expose a config such as `versionedstore.changelog.additional.compaction.lag.ms` to allow users to tune this value.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

my local machine, testIntervalBoundary is asserting on nearly 2.5 million records, when it appears that the test is written to need only 100-1000 records to perform assertions. This causes OOMEs in the test assertions which iterate over the set of records and perform memory allocations.\r\n\r\nI looked into reducing the assertion's memory overhead, but it didn't seem practical as even the smallest allocations appeared to exceed the memory limit.\r\n\r\nInstead, I configured the pre-existing throttle mechanism inside the MonitorableSourceConnector, so that tests now seem to produce ~90k records on my machine, leaving adequate spare memory for the existing assertions to pass without issue.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

to the backing topic.\r\n\r\nThis change will make fixes targeted at the task change logic also apply to the StandaloneHerder automatically, and prevent the divergence of the two code

They are unavailable because the connectors fail to configure. Connectors fail to configure because the worker is already shutting down by the time they are ready to be configured.\r\n\r\n# Change\r\n\r\nThis highlights a gap in MirrorMaker startup sequence where it does not wait for connectors to be configured by the herders before declaring itself as \"started\". This leads to a situation where MirrorMaker claims it has started but the herders are still in the process of configuring the connectors. During this time, mirror maker will not perform any replication.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we add a dependency on connector configuration for the MirrorMaker to declare itself as started.\r\n\r\n# Rejected alternative\r\nAn alternative approach is to modify the test to wait for connectors to get configured on all 3 MM nodes before starting the actual test i.e. before making a call to create topic. But this alternative is artificially hiding the problems which users of MirrorMaker may also face.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-21T19:01:35Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T10:00:39Z","closed_at":"2023-07-10T16:53:02Z","merged_at":"2023-07-10T16:53:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9a3e60dcc0aab24b609ffa808f169cd2e1eecc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

implementation of KIP-770 had a proposal to deprecate the per partition (`buffered.records.per.partition`) and introduce a new one called `input.buffer.max.bytes`. This new config is supposed to act at a StreamThread level instead of the current StreamTask level and would pause all non empty partitions once the bytes exceeded a threshold.\r\nHowever, this had introduced a performance regression where due to a race condition, once the bytes amassed exceeded the limit, the throughput would nose dive to 0. This race condition was found here: https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/557ca17fef1f7e6556b13ecfa2068fe5576d30b2/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/PartitionGroup.java#L156-L164.\r\nWhat seems to be happening is that the non empty partitions are paused but they are still getting data which means the lag is growing making it a chicken and egg problem because they were never getting resumed because the overall bytes is greater than the threshold.\r\nIn this PR, a logic has been added to StreamTask to also resume partitions which became empty after this round of processing which removes that race

counts\r\n\r\nPerformance of KRaft metadata image changes is currently O(<# of topics in cluster>). This means the amount of time it takes to create just a single topic scales linearly with the number of topics in the entire cluster. This impact both controllers and brokers because both use the metadata image to represent the KRaft metadata log. The performance of these changes should scale with the number of topics being changed – creating a single topic should perform similarly regardless of the number of topics in the cluster.\r\n\r\nThis patch leverages persistent data structures to avoid copying the entire `TopicsImage` upon every change.  It initially introduced a dependency on the [Paguro](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/Paguro/) library for immutable/persistent collection support in Java.  This library could have been a good fit because it is relatively small and [well-integrated](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/Paguro/blob/main/inheritanceHierarchy.pdf) with the existing Java Collections class hierarchy (the latter property especially helps to minimize the changes required to introduce the library into the existing code base).  Unfortunately the Paguro library does not support Java 8, so we moved to [Vavr](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr), which does support Java 8.  Vavr is also greatly inspired by Scala, so it is a good cultural fit with this project.  The patch minimized the changes needed by introducing a couple of wrapper classes, `Vavr{Set,Map}AsJava`.  Note that [Vavr has an open issue to add better integration with the standard Java interfaces](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/issues/1728), so at some point we would likely be able to use that instead.  Finally, a third iteration of this patch leverages [PCollections](https://github.com/hrldcpr/pcollections) because it was clearly the best fit for https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13437 due to the O(N) performance of Paguro and Vavr when invoking `tailSet()` on a sorted set, whereas it is O(log N) in PCollections.  This function is not needed here, so this issue in those two libraries would have gone unnoticed without that other PR.\r\n\r\nThis patch also adds the following JMH benchmarks demonstrating the resulting performance changes.  Note that the Vavr implementation is shown to perform comparably to the Paguro one.  The PCollections implementation benchmarks at about half the speed as those two libraries, and the reason for the slower performance is described [here](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/Paguro/wiki/UncleJim-vs.-PCollections).\r\n\r\n- `TopicsImageSingleRecordChangeBenchmark` tracks how long it takes to create a new topic.  This is the benchmark that clearly identifies the O(N) behavior in the existing code and that most dramatically illustrates a performance improvement.\r\n\r\nAs shown below, the existing code takes several orders of magnitude longer to make a single change than the new code.  The existing code, with 12,500 topics, took 1.4 milliseconds on my laptop and grows more or less linearly as the number of topics grows.  The new code took a constant amount of time (~250 nanoseconds for Paguro and Vavr, ~500 nanoseconds for PCollections) regardless of the number of topics in the cluster.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the improvement is because it is inexpensive to add, update, or delete an entry in an immutable, persistent map to create a new persistent map.  The new map shares the vast amount of the old map; only the root node and any nodes along the path to the node that must change are swapped out, and when the reference to the old map is released the swapped-out nodes can be garbage-collected. (There are typically 5 times as many nodes to swap out in a PCollections data structure, which is why it performs slower.)\r\n\r\n**Current Code, TopicsImageSingleRecordChangeBenchmark**\r\nTotal Topic Count | nanoseconds/op | error\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n12,500 | 1,410,901 | 153,461\r\n25,000 | 3,570,451 | 221,992\r\n50,000 | 14,143,125 | 1,123,616\r\n100,000 | 31,126,930 | 4,243,625\r\n\r\n**Updated Code, TopicsImageSingleRecordChangeBenchmark**\r\nTotal Topic Count | nanoseconds/op (Paguro) | error  | nanoseconds/op (Vavr) | error | nanoseconds/op (PColl) | error\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n12,500 | 258 | 13 | 274 | 9 | 473 | 3 |\r\n25,000 | 265 | 8 | 291 | 4 | 489 | 8 |\r\n50,000 | 273 | 5 | 293 | 5 | 486 | 3 |\r\n100,000 | 222 | 4 | 254 | 3 | 509 | 11 |\r\n\r\n\r\n- `TopicsImageZonalOutageBenchmark` simulates a zonal outage where each broker in the zone will lose its session – in this benchmark we assume the controller deals with them one by one rather than demoting 1/3 of the cluster all at once.  Since the number of topics per broker does not change very much, we expect O(N) behavior with the current code but not with the updated code, so we should see a performance improvement here as well -- and in fact we do.\r\n\r\nThe existing code scales with the number of topics in the cluster, thus the time always doubles as the cluster size doubles, increasing from 5ms to 47ms (a factor of 9) as the cluster scales by a factor of 8.  The updated code should scale with the number of affected topics, which in this case, based on the (debatable) values chosen of 10000 replicas per broker and 10 partitions per topic, means a factor of 1.6 (from 4167 topics affected to 6667 topics affected) as the cluster scaled by a factor of 8.  In fact we see the time spent increasing by a factor of 2.6 (from 4.4 ms to 11.6 ms) when the cluster scaled by that factor of 8.  This a bit higher than expected, but it is still sub-linear (and there is some +/- error in these numbers, so the sub-linear behavior is the real point as opposed to the specific number).\r\n\r\n**Current Code, TopicsImageZonalOutageBenchmark**\r\nTotal Topic Count | ms/op | error | (Brokers Impacted) | (Topics Impacted)\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n12,500 | 5.2 | 0.4 | 1/36 | 4,167\r\n25,000 | 10.6 | 0.1 | 1/75 | 5,000\r\n50,000 | 21.7 | 0.4 | 1/150 | 6,667\r\n100,000 | 47.7 | 5.2 | 1/300 | 6,667\r\n\r\n**Updated Code, TopicsImageZonalOutageBenchmark**\r\nTotal Topic Count | ms/op (Paguro) | error | ms/op (Vavr) | error | ms/op (PColl) | error | (Brokers Impacted) | (Topics Impacted)\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n12,500 | 4.4 | 0.2 | 3.8 | 0.3 | 7.7 | 1.8 | 1/36 | 4,167\r\n25,000 | 6.9 | 0.2 | 6.0 | 0.3 | 11.2 | 0.3 | 1/75 | 5,000\r\n50,000 | 10.2 | 2.5 | 11.6 | 1.1 | 17.5 | 0.2 | 1/150 | 6,667\r\n100,000 | 11.6 | 2.8 | 10.6 | 0.8 | 19.6 | 0.1 | 1/300 | 6,667\r\n\r\n\r\n- `TopicsImageSnapshotLoadBenchmark` simulates the loading of a snapshot when the broker starts – i.e. load up 100,000 topics/1M partitions from scratch and commit them all at once.  We would expect to see some performance degradation here in the updated code, and the question really was by how much.\r\n\r\nThis is the benchmark that simulates the case where every topic is affected – e.g when we load the initial snapshot during startup.  We expect the persistent data structures to perform worse here because every perturbation to create a new tree implies replacing some path in the old tree and sharing the remainder.  That’s a lot of replacing and a lot of garbage collecting.  It turns out to be a 20%-40% penalty (and a 100% penalty for PCollections).   This happens far less frequently than the scenarios described above – people create topics and ISRs change more frequently than the brokers roll – so the performance degradation here seems like a reasonable penalty to accept.\r\n\r\n**Current Code, TopicsImageSnapshotLoadBenchmark**\r\nTotal Topic Count | ms/op | error\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n12,500 | 9.2 | 0.2\r\n25,000 | 20.7 | 1.9\r\n50,000 | 41.6 | 2.9\r\n100,000 | 110.8 | 12.4\r\n\r\n**Updated Code, TopicsImageSnapshotLoadBenchmark**\r\nTotal Topic Count | ms/op (Paguro) | error | ms/op (Vavr) | error | ms/op (PColl) | error\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n12,500 | 13.7 | 1.3 | 10.9 | 0.4 | 20.2 | 2.7 |\r\n25,000 | 28.9 | 1.4 | 27.2 | 1.6 | 44.4 | 3.5 |\r\n50,000 | 67.6 | 1.6 | 54.6 | 0.6 | 91.6 | 8.1 |\r\n100,000 | 126.0 | 12.9 | 131.8 | 2.7 | 219.7 | 14.1 |\r\n\r\n\r\n- `KRaftMetadataRequestBenchmark` is a version of an existing set of benchmarks that we have for ZooKeeper-based brokers.  It demonstrates a *potential* slowdown in read performance with the new code of between 5% and 10% when requesting metadata for all topics -- but the evidence is not particularly strong as some cases actually perform better.  Overall there doesn't seem to be anything here that strongly cautions against this change.\r\n\r\n**KRaftMetadataRequestBenchmark.testMetadataRequestForAllTopics**\r\n**Current Code,

broker topic metric FetchMessageConversionsPerSec doesn't get recorded on a fetch message conversion.\r\nThe bug is that we pass in a callback that expects a MultiRecordsSend in KafkaApis:\r\n```scala\r\ndef updateConversionStats(send: Send): Unit = {\r\n  send match {\r\n    case send: MultiRecordsSend if send.recordConversionStats != null =>\r\n      send.recordConversionStats.asScala.toMap.foreach {\r\n        case (tp, stats) => updateRecordConversionStats(request, tp, stats)\r\n      }\r\n    case _ =>\r\n  }\r\n} \r\n```\r\nBut we call this callback with a NetworkSend in the SocketServer:\r\n```scala\r\nselector.completedSends.forEach { send =>\r\n  try {\r\n    val response = inflightResponses.remove(send.destinationId).getOrElse {\r\n      throw new IllegalStateException(s\"Send for ${send.destinationId} completed, but not in `inflightResponses`\")\r\n    }\r\n    updateRequestMetrics(response)\r\n\r\n    // Invoke send completion callback\r\n    response.onComplete.foreach(onComplete => onComplete(send))\r\n```\r\nNote that Selector.completedSends returns a collection of NetworkSend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

Kafka Connect in distributed mode currently retries infinitely with a fixed retry backoff (`250 ms`) in case of errors arising during connector task reconfiguration.\r\n- Tasks can be \"reconfigured\" during connector startup (to get the initial task configs from the connector), a connector resume or if a connector explicitly requests it via its context.\r\n- Task reconfiguration essentially entails requesting a connector instance for its task configs and writing them to the Connect cluster's config storage (in case a change in task configs is detected).\r\n- A fixed retry backoff of 250 ms leads to very aggressive retries - consider a Debezium connector which attempts to initiate a database connection in its [taskConfigs method](https://github.com/debezium/debezium/blob/bf347da71ad9b0819998a3bc9754b3cc96cc1563/debezium-connector-sqlserver/src/main/java/io/debezium/connector/sqlserver/SqlServerConnector.java#L63). If the connection fails due to something like an invalid login, the Connect worker will essentially spam connection attempts frequently and indefinitely (until the connector config / database side configs are fixed).\r\n- An exponential backoff retry mechanism seems more well suited for the `DistributedHerder::reconfigureConnectorTasksWithRetry` method.

analogous to the existing `TimestampedKeyValueStoreBuilder` for building timestamped stores. This PR also updates the existing KTable store materializer class to materialize versioned stores in addition to timestamped stores. As part of this change, the materializer is renamed from `TimestampedKeyValueStoreMaterializer` to simply `KeyValueStoreMaterializer`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

initiates an async request to the controller to grab a block of producer IDs and then blocks waiting for a response from the controller.\r\n\r\nThis is done in the request handler threads while

part of introducing versioned key-value stores in [KIP-889](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-889%3A+Versioned+State+Stores), we want to lift the existing DSL restriction that KTable stores are always TimestampedKeyValueStores to allow for KTable stores which are VersionedKeyValueStores instead. This PR lifts the restriction by replacing raw usages of TimestampedKeyValueStore with a new KeyValueStoreWrapper which supports either TimestampedKeyValueStore or VersionedKeyValueStore. (Until versioned stores are actually exposed to users in a follow-up PR, all KTables stores will continue to be TimestampedKeyValueStores.)\r\n\r\nThe loss of type-safety from `StoreBuilder<TimestampedKeyValueStore<K, VR>>` to `StoreBuilder<?>` is unfortunate but necessary in order to allow for top-level VersionedKeyValueStores, so that users may access versioned stores for use in `transform()` operations and interactive queries.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

#13205.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n- build works fine in trunk with Gradle 7.6 and spotless gradle plugin 6.13.0 for all currently used JDK versions (that is: JDK 8 / JDK 11 / JDK 17)\r\n- however, recent spotless gradle plugin versions (6.14.+) support only JDK 11+ versions: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/plugin-gradle/CHANGES.md#6140---2023-01-26\r\n- given a fact that Kafka still needs to support JDK 8 builds (until Kafka version 4.0) it is reasonable to simply remove spotless checks out of Jenkinsfile (and re-introduce them when the time comes).\r\n\r\nFor even more details

part of introducing versioned key-value stores in [KIP-889](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-889%3A+Versioned+State+Stores), we'd like a way to represent a versioned key-value store (`VersionedKeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>`) as a regular key-value store (`KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>`) in order to be compatible with existing DSL methods for passing key-value stores, e.g., [StreamsBuilder#table()](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3012332e3d82947e434933efd4ab4e9366ab429d/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/StreamsBuilder.java#L260) and [KTable methods](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3012332e3d82947e434933efd4ab4e9366ab429d/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KTable.java#L153), which are explicitly typed to accept `Materialized<K, V, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>`. This way, we do not need to introduce new versions of all relevant StreamsBuilder and KTable methods to relax the Materialized type to accept versioned stores. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the new `VersionedBytesStore extends KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>` interface for this purpose, along with the corresponding supplier (`VersionedBytesStoreSupplier`) and implementation (`RocksDbVersionedKeyValueBytesStoreSupplier`). The `RocksDbVersionedKeyValueBytesStoreSupplier` implementation leverages an adapter (`VersionedKeyValueToBytesStoreAdapter`) to assist in converting from `VersionedKeyValueStore` to `VersionedBytesStore`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

part of introducing versioned key-value stores in [KIP-889](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-889%3A+Versioned+State+Stores), we'd like a way to represent a versioned key-value store (`VersionedKeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>`) as a regular key-value store (`KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>`) in order to be compatible with existing DSL methods for passing key-value stores, e.g., [StreamsBuilder#table()](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3012332e3d82947e434933efd4ab4e9366ab429d/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/StreamsBuilder.java#L260) and [KTable methods](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3012332e3d82947e434933efd4ab4e9366ab429d/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/kstream/KTable.java#L153), which are explicitly typed to accept `Materialized<K, V, KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>`. This way, we do not need to introduce new versions of all relevant StreamsBuilder and KTable methods to relax the Materialized type to accept versioned stores. \r\n\r\nAs part of representing a versioned key-value store as a regular key-value bytes store, we need a way to serialize a value and timestamp as a single byte array, where the value may be null (in order to represent putting a tombstone with timestamp into the versioned store). This PR introduces the serdes for doing so. See https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13250 for its usage.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

(size > buffer.remaining())\r\n    throw new SchemaException(\"Error reading array of size \" + size + \", only \" + buffer.remaining() + \" bytes available\");\r\n``` \r\nArray type has the above code snippet which checks if there are enough bytes in the buffer to read all the array elements. However, there is a unit mismatch because `size` is the number of elements in the array, not the number of bytes. Thus, even if the above check passes there still might be not enough bytes remaining in the buffer. It seems to be impossible to compute byte size of the array before reading the whole array because each element of the array might have a different size (for example, array of strings). I think array size check can be improved by explicitly checking for OOM & buffer read exceptions. I've also added a new unit test `testReadArrayWithIncorrectSize` which demonstrates the problem of the current implementation. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

from bd32d98bd7cbd8cff35d6786bc8b00061e0fedf7 for 3.2 and earler.\r\n\r\nWhen a leader becomes a follower, it is likely that it has uncommitted records in its log. When it reaches out to the leader, the leader will detect that they have diverged and it will return the diverging epoch and offset. The follower truncates it log based on this.\r\n\r\nThere is a small caveat in this process. When the leader return the diverging epoch and offset, it also includes its high watermark, low watermark, start offset and end offset. The current code in the `AbstractFetcherThread` works as follow. First it process the partition data and then it checks whether there is a diverging epoch/offset. The former may accidentally expose uncommitted records as this step updates the local watermark to whatever is received from the leader. As the follower, or the former leader, may have uncommitted records, it will be able to updated the high watermark to a larger offset if the leader has a higher watermark than the current local one. This result in exposing uncommitted records until the log is finally truncated. The time window is short but a fetch requests coming at the right time to the follower could read those records. This is especially true for clients out there which uses recent versions of the fetch request but without implementing KIP-320.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, the follower logs the following messages:\r\n* `Truncating XXX to offset 21434 below high watermark 21437`\r\n* `Non-monotonic update of high watermark from (offset=21437 segment=[20998:98390]) to (offset=21434 segment=[20998:97843])`.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to mitigate the issue by starting by checking on whether a diverging epoch/offset is provided by the leader and skip processing the partition data if it is. This basically means that the first fetch request will result in truncating the log and a subsequent fetch request will update the low/high watermarks.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Ritika Reddy

RocksDB-based implementation for versioned key-value stores introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13188 has a well-defined \"history retention\" parameter which specifies how far back in time (relative to the current observed stream time) reads may take place, but there is no well-defined equivalent (aka \"grace period\") for how far back in time writes will be accepted. Instead, there is an implicit grace period whereby the store accepts all writes which affect valid reads. This doesn't quite work, though, because it requires infinite tombstone retention when the latest value for a particular key is a tombstone -- if the latest value for a key is a very old tombstone, we can’t expire it because if there’s an even older non-null put to store later, then without the tombstone we’ll accept this write as the latest value for the key, even though it isn't.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, this PR changes the versioned store semantics to define an explicit \"grace period\" property. ([KIP-889](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-889%3A+Versioned+State+Stores) has been updated accordingly.) For now, grace period will always be equal to the history retention, though in the future we can introduce a new KIP to expose options to configure grace period separately. \r\n\r\n### Committer
