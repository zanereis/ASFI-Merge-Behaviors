created from patch supplied in [GROOVY-7951](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-7951).  It seems like a reasonable change to make, though I did have trouble thinking up a way to test it that would be meaningful.  If anyone can nudge me in the right direction I can try to write up a test if you think it's warranted in this case.\n\nI considered whether `genericsTypes.clone()` should be used, but it didn't seem to be common and most uses of the array seem to be read only.\n","created_at":"2016-10-07T14:47:19Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T05:11:23Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T05:08:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdbd448de1f4d002a3a355a86263341a51974f12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/441/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/441/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/441/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/6650c798aae487ee3b9cd92c8e1470ddfad63125","head":{"label":"jwagenleitner:GROOVY-7951","ref":"GROOVY-7951","sha":"6650c798aae487ee3b9cd92c8e1470ddfad63125","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36817367,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjgxNzM2Nw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"jwagenleitner/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner/groovy","description":"Mirror

was partly broken (or at least utterly inconsistent) between versions `2.4.2` and `2.4.6`. Simple test case:\n\n```\ndef foo = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\ndef bar = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]\nassert [[0, 1]] == foo.intersect(bar)\n```\n\nwould fail in the aforementioned versions as `[]` would be returned. This is fixed in `2.4.7` but to avoid future regressions, it is nice to have test covering this case, as suggested by @glaforge and @sbglasius on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YouriAckx/status/769230038847918080?lang=en).\n\nA basic search didn't reveal any similar test cases (some `Foo` intersection comparison can be found but it can be seen as a different test case).\n","created_at":"2016-08-28T13:25:05Z","updated_at":"2016-08-28T18:48:04Z","closed_at":"2016-08-28T18:46:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"426a6cfe1a0c07545e7fbb3a0ff8031481bdfb2c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/881bee52e77a9d7bae1688992b689faf9039664c","head":{"label":"yackx:intersect","ref":"intersect","sha":"881bee52e77a9d7bae1688992b689faf9039664c","user":{"login":"yackx","id":1193689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM2ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1193689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx","html_url":"https://github.com/yackx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66762403,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Njc2MjQwMw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"yackx/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yackx","id":1193689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM2ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1193689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx","html_url":"https://github.com/yackx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yackx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yackx/groovy","description":"Mirror

infinite loop in `Iterable.collate` method when `step` parameter is equals to zero.\n\nExample:\n\n``` groovy\n[ 1, 2, 3 ].collate( 2, 0 )\n```\n\nThe result is a infinite loop because the step parameter is used directly in the for increment: `pos += step` \n\nIn the fixing  I assumed that the `step` parameter should be equals to `size` parameter, looks like in the `collate(self, size, size, keepRemainder)` overloaded method, with absence of `step` and I considered backward compatibility with negative steps.\n\nThks.\nFelipe
