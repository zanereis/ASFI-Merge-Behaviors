What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR supports using HDFS to backup and restore notebook.\r\nIt is similar to https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1479.\r\nHowever this PR just use WebHDFS API, so we don't need to care about hadoop libraries' dependency.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1515](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1515)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nSet the variables in zeppelin-site.xml\r\n- zeppelin.notebook.storage : org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.HDFSNotebookRepo\r\n- hdfs.url : Hadoop WebHDFS URL. default: http://localhost:50070/webhdfs/v1/\r\n- hdfs.user : HDFS user. default: hdfs\r\n- hdfs.maxlength : Maximum number of lines of results fetched. default: 100000\r\n- hdfs.notebook.dir : notebook location directory in HDFS. default: /tmp\r\n\r\nAfter zeppelin daemon start, check the notebook directories in ``hdfs.notebook.dir``.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-04T15:41:02Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:26Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06ea4a170e5d126572436949b453963523685383","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1600/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1600/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1600/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/123a074e7d07621d01cd2698f75257af3c42a79e","head":{"label":"aspen01:branch-0.6","ref":"branch-0.6","sha":"123a074e7d07621d01cd2698f75257af3c42a79e","user":{"login":"aspen01","id":4233396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzMzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4233396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01","html_url":"https://github.com/aspen01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":71256486,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTI1NjQ4Ng==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"aspen01/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aspen01","id":4233396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzMzOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4233396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01","html_url":"https://github.com/aspen01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspen01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aspen01/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nElasticSearch was released in Oct 26 and It requires 5.x client driver but zeppelin currently use 2.x only.\r\n\r\n- we need 2 different profiles for 2.x and 5.x (there are no 3.x, 4.x)\r\n- 5.x client require different codebase. In this case we should keep 2 version of code at the same time like the spark code.\r\n- 5.x client requires JAVA 8 at least\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - create profiles for 2.x and 5.x\r\n* [x] - setup JAVA 8 validation for 5.x \r\n* [x] - update default `elasticsearch.version` to 2.4.x (the most recent for 2.x)\r\n* [x] - update license\r\n* [x] - refactor\r\n* [x] - create the 5.x interpreter\r\n* [x] - loading dynamically\r\n* [x] - hide unused classes using maven profile\r\n* [ ] - write tests for 5.x\r\n* [ ] - update docs (build, usage, upgrade)\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1618\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nSome tests will be

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR adds [PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module) authentication support based on the introduced Shiro security implementation. With PAM support system users have immediate access to a secured Zeppelin instance.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Create PAM realm\r\n* [x] - Create test for PAM authentication\r\n* [x] - Test with running Zeppelin instance\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1611](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1611])\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n`PamRealmTest` executes an automated test if the environment variables `PAM_USER` and `PAM_PASS` are set. This should be set to system username and password.\r\nThe test also includes a main function to manually execute the test. Setting the environment variables for example on MacOS for your IDE use `launchctl setenv PAM_USER user` and `launchctl setenv PAM_PASS xxxxx`, the test can then be run from your IDE. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No \r\n* Does this needs documentation?

This PR is trying to add interpreter option to `interpreter-setting.json` to allow user to set the default mode. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\nThis PR is just a short term solution. There're several followup work needs to be done.\r\n* Refactor livy interpeter to adapt scope mode. \r\n* Option should be interpretergroup level setting rather than interpreter level setting. \r\n* Format of `interperter-setting.json` is not consistent with `Interpereter.json`, there's some code duplication, like `RegisteredInterpereter`,  `InterpreterInfo` and etc. \r\n* And this PR doesn't address the issue of mode restriction, user can still change to an invalid mode manually.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1606\r\n\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nOutline the steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-03T04:11:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T16:15:50Z","closed_at":"2016-11-07T16:15:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac635ed00558b6b228fb44cddb8f1c32f98d710d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1585/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1585/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1585/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/a4358b48735efb73702d18eb76970e0c45d20854","head":{"label":"zjffdu:ZEPPELIN-1606","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1606","sha":"a4358b48735efb73702d18eb76970e0c45d20854","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46907161,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjkwNzE2MQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"zjffdu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nThis contribution would to introduce Neo4j Cypher intepreter and the new network visualization;\r\nat the same time would provide base APIs that enable other graph databases (or graph framworks such as GraphX or Giraph).\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Create the network visualization\r\n* [x] - Provide base APIs to manage graph results (under: org.apache.zeppelin.interpreter.graph.*)\r\n* [x] - Create the Neo4j intepreter\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[[ZEPPELIN-1604]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1604)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nDonwload and execute [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/?ref=home) v3.x, you can also pull a [Docker image](https://neo4j.com/developer/docker/).\r\n\r\nIn order to execute test cases, if you are running Java 7, you need to also provide an environment variable telling the tests where to find Java 8, because Neo4j-the-database needs it to run.\r\n```bash\r\nexport NEO4J_JAVA=<path/to/java/home>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse this statement to create a dummy dataset\r\n```bash\r\n%neo4j\r\nUNWIND range(1,100) as id\r\nCREATE (p:Person {id:id, name: \"Name \" + id, age: id % 3}) WITH collect(p) as people\r\nUNWIND people as p1\r\nUNWIND range(1,10) as friend\r\nWITH p1, people[(p1.id + friend) % size(people)] as p2\r\nCREATE (p1)-[:KNOWS {years: abs(p2.id - p2.id)}]->(p2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can write some simple queries like:\r\n```bash\r\n%neo4j\r\nMATCH (p:Person)-[r:KNOWS]-(p1:Person)\r\nRETURN p, r, p1\r\nLIMIT 10;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n%neo4j\r\nMATCH (p:Person)-[r:KNOWS]-(p1:Person)\r\nRETURN p.id AS ID_A, p.name AS NAME_A, r.years AS YEARS, p1.id AS ID_B, p1.name AS NAME_B\r\nLIMIT 20;\r\n```\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![Simple cypher query network

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrent dynamic forms elements in zeppelin-web have no ordering. The ordering of the dynamic elements is random which can be annoying when you have many of them.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that the angular frontend uses \"for key in object\" pattern with no sorting.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nBring some security check in `NotebookRestApi`.\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\n[Bug Fix | Improvement | Refactoring]\r\n### Todos\r\n- [x] - Create a proper way to throw webapp error\r\n- [x] - Add in `NotebookAuthorization` some method to check if user is owner, reader or writer\r\n- [x] - Add Authorization check in `NotebookRestapi` \r\n- [x] - Add New test for security in notebook rest api\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n- [ZEPPELIN-1586](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1586)\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nFirst, force Zeppelin to use auth.\r\n- In `conf/zeppelin-site.xml` change `zeppelin.anonymous.allowed` to **false**\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  <property>\r\n  <name>zeppelin.anonymous.allowed</name>\r\n  <value>false</value>\r\n  <description>Anonymous user allowed by default</description>\r\n  </property>\r\n  ```\r\n- In `conf/shiro.ini` set Shiro to use `Auth` at the end of the file\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  #/** = anon                                                                                                                                           \r\n  /** = authc\r\n  ```\r\n- Start Zeppelin, login and set some permission to a note\r\n- try to get a note from Zeppelin Rest Api `http://localhost:8080/api/notebook/{noteId}` (you can use your browser or curl (if you use curl please add shiro token to curl cookie))\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n![note_permission_rest_api](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3139557/19827600/ffd68a06-9dea-11e6-8dd5-43f3bd401011.gif)\r\n### Questions:\r\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis is to add impersonation routine for SparkInterpreter, meaning any communication with hadoop hdfs should be done with current user credentials\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n- [x] - add privilege mode\r\n- [ ] - add tests\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1587](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1587)\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nexecuting hdfs related file write should be done by your logged in username, e.g. in the example i used the following code:\r\n```\r\nval file = sc.textFile(\"hdfs:/inputFilePath\")\r\nfile.cache()\r\nval wordCount = file.flatMap(line => line.split(\" \")).map(word => (word, 1)).reduceByKey(_ + _)\r\nwordCount.saveAsTextFile(\"hdfs:/outputFolderPath\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![impersonate

breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n- Does this needs documentation?

recreated this from https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1322\r\n### What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nWhile running a Notebook using shell, spark, python uses same user as which zeppelin server is running. Which means these interprets have same permission on file system as zeppelin server.\r\nIMO users should be able to impersonate themselves as a complete security system.\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\n[Improvement]\r\n### Todos\r\n- [x] - Update doc\r\n- [x] - FIX NPEs\r\n- [x] - FIX CI\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n- [ZEPPELIN-1320](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1320)\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Enable shiro auth in shiro.ini\r\n- Add ssh key for the same user you want to try and impersonate (say user1).\r\n\r\n```\r\nadduser user1\r\nssh-keygen\r\nssh user1@localhost mkdir -p .ssh\r\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user1@localhost 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'\r\n```\r\n- Start zeppelin server, try and run following in paragraph in a notebook\r\n- Go to interpreter setting page, and enable \"User Impersonate\" in any of the interpreter (in my example its shell interpreter)\r\n\r\n```\r\n%sh\r\nwhoami\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck that it should run as new user, i.e. \"user1\"\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n![user impersonate](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674497/20213127/f32fdc52-a82c-11e6-8e33-aebd6a943c5f.gif)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n- Does this needs documentation? yes\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-23T07:48:58Z","updated_at":"2018-02-25T03:46:26Z","closed_at":"2016-11-18T03:07:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"381801b10b5a6de873f109b1971f3ea2143b780a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1554/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1554/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1554/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/dc69c9d2d3c520d4a0d354373f451ad66f9c8435","head":{"label":"prabhjyotsingh:ZEPPELIN-1320-2","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1320-2","sha":"dc69c9d2d3c520d4a0d354373f451ad66f9c8435","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44664903,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDY2NDkwMw==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nThe idea behind this feature is to bring flexibility to the user to let him configure his repo via UI without restarting Apache Zeppelin.\nThis is flexible enough to handle most of the basic needs, but more complex case can be added in the future. I will not implement all NotebookRepo, this should be done in different PR since it will depend on special needs. I will just provide a simple example with VFS notebook repo.\n\n**_NB**_: this scope of the PR doesn't include save change in the configuration file of zeppelin as well as implementation of every notebook repo, git, s3 etcetc, this will be added later if needed.\n### What type of PR is it?\n- **Improvement**\n### Todos\n- [x] - Implement backend.\n- [x] - Implement frontend.\n- [x] - Implement LocalVFS directory change as exemple.\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- [ZEPPELIN-1575](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1575)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nGo to notebook repo setting page, edit the notebook path and save.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![notebook_repo_settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3139557/19643248/583dbc2a-9a24-11e6-8f14-7deda9c443f2.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first of two major steps needed to improve matplotlib integration in Zeppelin (ZEPPELIN-1344). The latter, which is a plotting backend with fully interactive tools enabled, will be done afterwards in a separate PR. This PR specifically for automatically displaying output from calls to matplotlib plotting functions inline with each paragraph. Thanks to the addition of post-execute hooks (ZEPPELIN-1423), there is no need to call any `show()` function to display an inline plot, just like in Jupyter.\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\nThe main code has been written and anyone who reads this is encouraged to test it, but there are a few minor todos:\r\n- [x] - Add unit tests\r\n- [x] - Add documentation\r\n- [x] - Add screenshot showing iterative plotting with angular mode\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1345](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1345)\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nIn a pyspark or python paragraph, enter and run\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plot should be displayed automatically without calling any `show()` function whatsoever. A special method called `configure_mpl()` can also be used to modify the inline plotting behavior. For example,\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nz.configure_mpl(close=False, angular=True)\r\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3])\r\n```\r\n\r\nallows for iterative updates to the plot provided you have PY4J installed for your python installation (which of course is always the case if you use pypsark). To clarify, this feature only currently works with pyspark (not python as there are no `angularBind()` and `angularUnbind()` methods yet). Doing something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill update the plot that was generated by the previous paragraph by leveraging Zeppelin's Angular Display System. However, by setting `close=False`, matplotlib will no longer automatically close figures so it is now up to the user to explicitly close each figure instance they create. There's quite a bit more options for `z.configure_mpl()`, but I will save that discussion for the documentation.\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![img](http://i.imgur.com/e1xHKnV.gif)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n- Does this needs documentation? Yes\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-18T04:52:10Z","updated_at":"2017-05-07T19:03:43Z","closed_at":"2016-11-08T15:21:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"777a635ccc90a5100fc064e93bcdb80b6f39ddb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/9ef6ff718addbabd9e7d7663fdfe2bce38436f03","head":{"label":"agoodm:ZEPPELIN-1345","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1345","sha":"9ef6ff718addbabd9e7d7663fdfe2bce38436f03","user":{"login":"agoodm","id":5179430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzk0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5179430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm","html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65423398,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQyMzM5OA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"agoodm/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"agoodm","id":5179430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzk0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5179430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm","html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agoodm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/agoodm/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

interpreter as a process and redirect stdin and stdout, only exception occurred (like syntax error or indentation error, etc) could give string like `...`.

What is this PR for?\n\nZEPPELIN-1472 - Create new LdapRealm based on Apache Knox LdapRealm: Provides LdapRealm Functionality similar to what Apache Knox provides. This is critical as in large enterprise environments Active Directory Global Catalogs are used for lookup with samAccountName and using a DN Template is not an option as their are multiple OUs. Also searching on \"userPrincipalName\" is risky in an AD environment since the explicit UPN vs Implicit UPN can be different this is definitely the case with environments using Office 365. And the LDAP userPrincipalName attribute is the explicit UPN which can be defined by the directory administrator to any value and it can be duplicated. SamAccountName is unique per domain and Microsoft states best practice is to not allow duplicate samAccountName's across the forest.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n###
