SUMMARY\r\nThis PR casts  number-like strings to numbers in order to ensure correct value validation in conditional formatting.\r\nBefore, we were comparing values that were actually strings and not numbers, which caused incorrect validation errors.\r\n\r\nI also did some refactoring to avoid unnecessary rerenders.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked issue\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/129187281-ab83bcde-870c-4715-a733-9448bdbd9c84.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open Table or Pivot Table v2 chart\r\n2. Add conditional formatter with \"Between\" operator and type left and right values. Verify that errors show up only if left value is larger than right. Try typing left value which is alphabetically \"larger\", but arithmetically smaller than right value in order to recreate the reported issue.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: fixes #16169 \r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user opened \"Add new metric\" popover and selected a column and/or aggregate, metric title is automatically set to \"column(aggregate)\". However, when user hovers with their mouse outside of the popover before saving, the title gets reset. Then, after saving, the label appears to be correct, but an empty string gets passed to executed query as a label, causing seemingly unrelated errors.\r\nThis PR converts `MetricsControl` component from class to functional and uses memoization to prevent resetting the title.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked issue and video in the comments\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/129045681-e33f2ab4-4aac-4d95-b928-6f5c3705e13f.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a chart\r\n2. Open new metric popover\r\n3. Add a column and aggregate\r\n4. Hover with your mouse outside of the popover - nothing should happen\r\n5. Save the metric and run query\r\n6. Chart should render as expected\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nThis is part 1 of a fix for #16067 to make the backend more resilient to incomplete chart metadata. If an adhoc metric is missing the `label` property, the backend can in most cases deduce what the label should be. Since the util `get_metric_name` is used in quite a few places in the backend and didn't have a single unit test, this PR also adds tests to ensure that the function works as expected. In addition, related types are improved and affected code updated.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user added an adhoc metric, then opened a popover to edit that metric and clicked \"Save\" without doing any changes, the metric label would disappear. This PR adds a check if old and edited metric are equal - if they are, no actions are taken.\r\n\r\nBasically what happened was that when we saved a metric without any changes, we didn't call `coerceAdhocMetrics` (which converts an object to AdhocMetric), but we did call `onChange`. The result was that we passed a normal object instead of AdhocMetric instance to value renderer, and in value renderer we checked for instanceof AdhocMetric\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked issue\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/129003100-1701671f-b658-49ad-bb2e-3ed13c0e5207.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Enable dnd\r\n1. Create a chart and add an adhoc metric\r\n2. Open a popover to edit that metric and click save without doing any changes\r\n3. The metric label should stay as it was, no changes should happen\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR changes the \"Highly-used\" tag name back to \"Popular\" which includes 11 charts that are either being used frequently already or the popular Echarts chart types that we want to promote. Since the new Echarts may not be highly used yet, also we don't have the usage data from the community, we decided to change the tag name back to \"Popular\".\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n<img width=\"1124\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes a problem with the visibility of the Omnibar dropdown. It also implements the ability to close the Omnibar by clicking ESC. Finally, it removes the ability to open the Omnibar with the _ctrl/cmd + s_ in order to stop it from interfering with the default browser functionality. The Omnibar can now be opened with _ctrl/cmd + k_.\r\n\r\nFixes: #15539\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/128879772-97e45c5e-84a9-4996-af59-b085d9e963cd.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/128880027-1694f0cb-de87-461b-9542-e1f72722dd08.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nTrying webpack without `TerserPlugin`, there doesn't seem to be any impact on the bundle size, yet we save a bunch of cpu time on the `npm run build` step. To be fair, when I don't remove the `.terser-plugin-cache/`, the difference is minimal, but assuming docker isn't doing anything special to keep that cache active, in that context, or in the context of a new env, the hit is pretty significant. This only affect `npm run build` but could shave a few minutes from some of our builds.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Methodology\r\n```\r\n# timing with\r\n$ time npm run build\r\n\r\n# cleanup between steps\r\n$ rm

SUMMARY\r\nThis brings in the code from https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15984/commits/eeb69678346a093a1692f2e319f205fde7d03789 that was lost in a feature branch merge. \r\n\r\nIt shows the same image/text options for charts on the report modal from charts that we show on the alerts/reports modals. \r\n\r\nThis also fixes a small bug where the dashboard needs to refetch reports on load.

INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate a chart with one of these options and ensure that the proper format was sent. Also the text options should only apply to tables.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nSuperset enables us to run different caching strategies under celery beat.\r\nThe ability here is to provide additional strategies from the config that can later be run if the strategy is chosen\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to use Strategy type like\r\n`EXTRA_CACHING_STRATEGIES: List[Type[Strategy]] = []`\r\nIt was required to split from the single cache.py file into smaller modules in order to avoid importing superset.app \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47772523/129695758-3a42226f-db80-4fd5-946a-ad08bdd2d17a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nAdd support for time grain based native-filters and cross-filters. The frontend work is done in https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1281 (this PR can be merged independently of that PR, as it only adds backend support for the feature). Other changes:\r\n\r\n- Add new `TypedDict`s for `AdhocFilterClause` and `QueryObjectFilterClause` and implement necessary changes where we were previously assuming filters were `Dict[str, Any]`.\r\n- Break up `to_adhoc` function into `simple_filter_to_adhoc` and `form_data_to_adhoc`, as the previous implementation was mixing filter objects with form data. Also fix affected tests + remove a mock that is deemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nAdding a few events to related to thumbnail generation. The main driver here is to be able to compute a `thumbnail_cache_hit_rate`\r\n- `DashboardRestApi.thumbnail.async`: endpoint is hit, 202 is returned and async process is triggered\r\n- `DashboardRestApi.thumbnail.redirect`: thumbnail exists for dashboard, redirecting to the right hash (digest)\r\n- `DashboardRestApi.thumbnail.from_cache`: indicates the thumbnail was loaded from cache (following the redirect)\r\n\r\nAll equivalent events for `ChartRestApi` are also logged the same way.\r\n\r\nLogically `cache_hit_rate = from_cache/(async+from_cache)`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nChanges:\r\n* Clickable ghost button for metrics and filters controls. Clicking a ghost button opens a popover without any fields pre-filled, which means user opts out of UX improvements introduced with drag and drop. Dnd works exactly as before.\r\n* A new popover for columns control, similar to a popover for metrics and filters. Contains 2 tabs - \"Saved\" with a select button for choosing calculated columns and \"Simple\" with a button for selecting normal columns.\r\n* Clickable ghost button and clickable labels in columns control. Clicking a ghost button opens an empty popover in which user can select a column. Clicking a label opens a popover prefilled with that label. Dnd works as before - column is added without using popover. Dnd is the preferred way of adding columns as it requires much less user input - 1 drag versus 4 clicks (open popover, click select button, select column, click save).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/128537355-321742e4-069f-467a-a553-87b879f3ccae.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adjusts who can see the new dashboard and chart subscribe Icon. Previously it was based on who can add a report, but now it is based on if you have access to alerts and reports in the settings menu. \r\n\r\nWhile looking through this, I noticed that a limited/gamma user does have permissions to add, view, and has menu access to Alerts and Reports. Maybe this is an oversight and we need to adjust the permissions for Gamma users? \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nAdmin User: \r\n![Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 11 27 15 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/128534395-882a3b06-1483-47c9-890b-db6f42ec6ef5.png)\r\nGamma: \r\n![Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 11 27 57 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/128534494-f57fdf8e-c9eb-42a0-87d8-4e6a6d32b907.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nIn airbnb we did some investigation for server-side processing time for dashboard requests, try to find perf bottleneck and improve the dashboard performance, especially for those large ones with multiple datasets and tabs. \r\n\r\nCurrently when user opens a dashboard we need 3 different API to fetch data:\r\n- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/<id_or_slug>`: to get dashboard metadata\r\n- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/<id_or_slug>/charts`: to get charts metadata for a given dashboard id\r\n- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/<id_or_slug>/datasets`: to get dataset metadata for a given dashboard id\r\n\r\nSince [this PR](#15688), we found the queries to `tables` is perf bottleneck, so we already made datasets request non-blocking for dashboard render. And given we already split big blob of dashboard data into 3 different APIs, it seems not necessary for each of request to query `tables`. This PR is to remove unnecessary dataset queries from these 2 requests.\r\n\r\nWe run some profiling for `/dashboard/id` and `/dashboard/id/charts` requests in `Datadog`. I used a heavy dashboard in airbnb as example, which has 80 datasets and about 300 charts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: \r\n<img width=\"941\" alt=\"Screen Shot

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16081\r\nCurrently, there is an issue with filters that handle boolean values. If the database engine does not provide boolean value implicit conversion, will cause the query to fail.\r\nImagine SQL:\r\n```\r\nSELECT case\r\n           when gender = 'boy' then True\r\n           else False\r\n       end AS boolean_gender,\r\n       count(num) AS \"COUNT(num)\"\r\nFROM birth_names\r\nWHERE case\r\n          when gender = 'boy' then True\r\n          else False\r\n      end IN ('false')\r\nGROUP BY case\r\n             when gender = 'boy' then True\r\n             else False\r\n         end\r\nORDER BY \"COUNT(num)\" DESC\r\nLIMIT 10000;\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe derived column(Calculated column in Superset) type is Boolean, and the operand is String('true')\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase\r\n    when gender = 'boy' then True\r\n    else False\r\nend IN ('false')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR introduced a conversion when the column type is boolean and operand type also is boolean.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/128458491-8c8d4e31-efb7-4445-9e2f-7ac50d246b42.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. select `birth_names` dataset\r\n2. create a new Calculated Columns. \r\nname: boolean_gender\r\nSQL expression : `case when gender = 'boy' then True else False end`\r\nData Type: Boolean\r\n3. create a treemap v2. select `boolean_gender` into Group by control; select sum(num) into Metric; check `emit dashboard cross filters`; saved to new dashboard `test`\r\n4. create a table. select `boolean_gender` into Group by control; select sum(num) into Metric; check `emit dashboard cross filters`; saved to dashboard `test`\r\n5. goto dashboard `test`\r\n6. select `true` or `false` in treemap v2, then the table can be filtered.\r\n7. double-check view query in table viz, where clause like below:\r\n```\r\nWHERE case\r\n          when gender = 'boy' then True\r\n          else False\r\n      end IN (false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16081\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade

SUMMARY\r\nAllows defining `canDropValue` function in `mapStateToProps` of controls in control panel (in superset-ui).\r\nThat will allow us not only to use generic `canDrop` functions for columns or adhoc metrics, but also more advanced ones - like `can drop column \"gender\" in \"Series\" control only if \"Breakdown\" control doesn't already have this column added`.\r\n\r\nIt's a prerequisite for fixing issue https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16071\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo changes\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Enable dnd\r\n1. Verify that everything works as before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nThis pr fixes an issue where user would view charts and run queries without saving but the api would return that user had modified the chart. This was caused because of a change in the api using query_context where accessing the slice table would do an automatic saved changed_on_delta_humanize. This pr add two new cols to the Slice table so that the user only see's actually modified charts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nbefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17326228/128384423-36b496e7-cd96-4b39-b4da-775ecb814fef.mov\r\n\r\nafter\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17326228/128393886-6ce5f8d3-4975-4fe1-bfd4-03a69d6df276.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThere are several issues with the `memoize` decorator:\r\n* It also catches `TypeError`s from within the memoized function\r\n* In case of the key is not cacheable, it runs the memoized function for the second time, while having its result computed already\r\n* It doesn't tell developers about possible fundamental problems with their memoizations (like, they accidentally provide a list to the memoized function and don't even know that memoization no longer works)\r\n* Its intended behavior does not work anyway because of the `if key in self.cache` before the `try/catch` block raising `TypeError` already.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes aforementioned issues:\r\n* Calling the wrapped function outside of the try/catch block\r\n* Returning the `value` variable regardless of the caching success status\r\n* Logging the caching failure together with the stack trace - once for each failure\r\n* Wrapping all cache operations in `try/catch` blocks.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, we can also remove the `try/catch` altogether to throw explicitly. I won't be against that, especially since original behavior was already shadowed by uncaught dictionary reference.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nI ran Superset locally and checked the memoization is still working. It is!\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFixes #16016\r\n\r\nThe example had a value for the `granularity_sqla` field that was not found in the

When that happens, the mechanism that is meant to detect changes in dataset thinks that there has been a change. The fix for this is to only begin checking for dataset changes after the first render.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nChart appears as normal rather than requiring user to click Run.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1095\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-04 at 1 48 46 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/128252795-acdeb355-25ef-4a1b-af7e-5eb404add34e.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
