is my discussed alternative that simplifies the implementation using `InvokerHelper#invokeMethod`.  If a delegate or owner implements `methodMissing` it will be called instead of trying `invokeMethod` on the next in line.  This is more consistent with the way property resolution works (see `Closure#getProperty`).\r\n\r\n`StaticTypeCheckingVisitor` will need a block similar to the one added for GROOVY-7996 in order for static compilation to line up.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-7232\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** This does not address the change in behavior discussed here:

tried to respect the apparent design of preferring declared methods over calls to `methodMissing`.  However, there was some mixed behavior on that front as seen in \"(**) involves methodMissing since delegate methodMissing has precedence over explicit owner method\" test cases.  I stuck with it because this new design gives dynamic behavior that more closely matches the static compilation behavior.\r\n\r\nIf `methodMissing` is okay to call on delegate instead of declared method on owner -- in the case of `DELEGATE_FIRST` and vice versa in the case of `OWNER_FIRST` -- I have a simpler solution that leverages `InvokerHelper.invokeMethod`.","created_at":"2020-07-08T00:01:49Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T17:03:29Z","closed_at":"2020-07-27T17:03:21Z","merged_at":"2020-07-27T17:03:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"a01d557f05310660f3168a72cfb6635bbd818596","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/7b02712a72e1db737277adf434c7ec066a06753e","head":{"label":"apache:GROOVY-7232","ref":"GROOVY-7232","sha":"7b02712a72e1db737277adf434c7ec066a06753e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache
