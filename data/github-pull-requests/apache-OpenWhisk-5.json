Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nSince Scala 2.12, [Either has been right biased](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.0/scala/util/Either.html) so explicitly calling `.right` before mapping etc is not necessary. Scala 2.13 deprecates this usage so... let's get rid of it now.\r\n\r\nThis also removes usages of `.right.get` for the same reason and to drop potential error cases where there are none.\r\n\r\nNo semantic change intended.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\nRef #4741 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nI broke this one out of the last PR because the concurrency looked a bit more tricky to get right on the surface. If I read the code correctly though, this should equally replicate the state we had before.\r\n\r\nEach individual task used way too big thread pools and the maximum amount of total work we do is `internalIters * 30` (cause the inner loops do 30 iterations), thus a single fixed thread pool of that size should suffice and can be reused in all tasks.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\nRef

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n- The ack logic that responds to kafka messages to the controller can be used by other components in the downstream. So move ack logic that is only available in invoker package to common package.\r\n- In our downstream, we are creating a new component called [Scheduler](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENWHISK/Autonomous+Container+Scheduler+v2). The Scheduler performs a kind of queue, where it also responds to queued stale messages to the controller. As such, the ack logic may be used by other components in the downstream, so it seems more appropriate to include it in a common package. And this change has the advantage that the ack logic can be modified more flexibly downstream.\r\n- `InvokerReactive` is also new and in use, so I moved `LogsCollector` from `InvokerReactive` to `Invoker` for container log collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nCurrently, The openwhisk uses the `waitTime` annotation to store the internal wait time until the action code is provisioned. But this value is only present for non-sequence related activations.\r\n\r\nInternally invoked actions can't know `waitTime` because this value is measured based on the start value of the first created TransactionId by topmost action.\r\n\r\nSo those actions invoked by topmost action must have a different TransactionId with a different start value.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem I've modified the TransactionId case class to have a parent/child structure.\r\n\r\n### Define the starting point for internally invoked action\r\n\r\nThis is the invocation flow of the sequence and conductor action in the controller. \r\n(Each action calls internal actions in a different way, so the starting point is different.)\r\n\r\n#### Sequence action\r\nAn `invokeNextAction` method could be the starting point to create child transactionId.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5635513/74133522-169ecf80-4c2c-11ea-8182-eba34e2cb597.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nwsk action create

Description\r\nA performance improvement was made to the `activations` collection in CosmosDB to index on the soft delete path `_deleted`. This change improved performance on queries and reduces the RU usage in CosmosDB.\r\n\r\nTo align with this change, the `ActivationViewMapper`'s `IndexingPolicy` was updated to add the new path to `includePaths`. This is used to verify that the acitvations collection's policy in CosmosDB is as expected in openwhisk upon connecting.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [X] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

experimental KubernetesClientWithInvokerAgent implementation of\r\nthe ContainerFactory SPI to simplify the codebase.  This code was an\r\nexploration of implementing pause/unpause functionality when using the\r\nKubernetesContainerFactory, but was never implemented to a useful\r\nlevel of functionality.  Most seriously, if an invoker or invoker\r\nagent crashed it would leave orphaned suspended pods that Kubernetes\r\nwas not able to cleanly remove without cluster admin-level\r\nintervention since they had been paused \"behind the back\" of the\r\nKubernetes scheduler using low-level mechanisms.  A secondary\r\nconsideration is that the actual invoker agent (go code in the\r\ndeploy-kube project) was only implemented for the case when the\r\nunderlying container engine was Docker. Given the subsequent shift\r\naway from Docker to containerd or cri-o, the invoker agent did not\r\nsupport recent versions of Kubernetes or OpenShift.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-02T22:59:33Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T15:13:48Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T15:13:43Z","merged_at":"2020-01-03T15:13:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e7b6ec845f20dec1dff0ce1649d09b1c9f131d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4785/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4785/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4785/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/statuses/b24bb41f69f5a6d1afe6e19776d54eecc2d7d5f2","head":{"label":"dgrove-oss:no-agent","ref":"no-agent","sha":"b24bb41f69f5a6d1afe6e19776d54eecc2d7d5f2","user":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90789275,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDc4OTI3NQ==","name":"openwhisk","full_name":"dgrove-oss/openwhisk","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dgrove-oss","id":5099100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTkxMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5099100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrove-oss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dgrove-oss/openwhisk","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `__OW_ACTION_VERSION` property to the execution environment. This is for example useful when an action caches some data, so it could add the version number to the cache keys so that deploying a new version of the action would automatically \"invalidate\" the previous cache entries.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n\r\nSee #4758 \r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ]

the container running even if the action produced truncated response.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIf a container sometimes produces replies that are greater than the allowed max size, that container cannot be reused. However, treating this in a similar fashion to unhandled exception or other developer error seems too heavy handed. Layer concurrency on this and you get a lot of failed activations and container churn due to a only slightly misbehaving action.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAs discussed [here](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ef18f833671a3266d4cde3bf4eaff379596d03b3e147a785a9b06941@%3Cdev.openwhisk.apache.org%3E), it changes the container proxy to provide an environment at init time (`/init`).\r\n\r\nBut I couldn't move the entire context from /run to /init to maintain backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### 1. /init\r\nPut environment variables in the env field. and runtimes can use this value.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"value\": {\r\n    \"name\" : String,\r\n    \"main\" : String,\r\n    \"code\" : String,\r\n    \"binary\": Boolean,\r\n    \"env\": Map[String, String] = {\r\n       \"__OW_NAMESPACE\",\r\n       \"__OW_ACTION_NAME\",\r\n       \"__OW_ACTIVATION_ID\",\r\n       \"__OW_TRANSACTION_ID\",\r\n       \"__OW_DEADLINE\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. /run\r\n\r\nThe namespace, action_name, activation_id, transaction_id, and deadline fields are uppercased and prefixed with \"`__OW_`\" by runtimes [[1]](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/actions-actionloop.md#what-the-launcher-needs-to-do). \r\n\r\n- `namespace` -> `__OW_NAMESPACE`\r\n- `action_name` -> `__OW_ACTION_NAME`\r\n\r\nI think these fields cannot be removed due to backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis is a draft pull request, please let me know if there is a better way.\r\n\r\n\r\n####

`AzureBlobAttachmentStore` as an `AttachmentStore` implementation backed by [Azure Blob](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/storage/blobs/)\r\n\r\nFixes #4666\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n`azure-storage-blob:12.0.0` is now based on [Project Reactor][1]. `AzureBlobAttachmentStore` uses the library via the Reaxtive Stream support (Publisher/Subscriber) from Akka and Project Reactor and thus enables non blocking reads and writes\r\n\r\nThis library adds following dependencies\r\n\r\n<img width=\"585\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/664531/68470672-8aeb6080-0242-11ea-98ce-6217cb1c420b.png\">\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo enable this one needs to configure\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n    azure-blob {\r\n        # Config property when using AzureBlobAttachmentStore\r\n        # whisk {\r\n        #  spi {\r\n        #    AttachmentStoreProvider = org.apache.openwhisk.core.database.azblob.AzureBlobAttachmentStoreProvider\r\n        #  }\r\n        #}\r\n\r\n        # Blob container endpoint like https://foostore.blob.core.windows.net/test-ow-travis\r\n        # It is of format https://<account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>\r\n        # endpoint =\r\n\r\n        # Storage account name\r\n        # account-name =\r\n\r\n        # Container name within storage account used to store the blobs\r\n        # container-name =\r\n\r\n        # Shared key credentials\r\n        # https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob#shared-key-credential\r\n        # account-key\r\n\r\n        # Folder path within the container (optional)\r\n        # prefix\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n`AzureBlobAttachmentStoreITTests` enables integration test which run against the Azure Blob service. It needs following env settings\r\n\r\n* `AZ_ENDPOINT` - Endpoint url\r\n* `AZ_ACCOUNT_NAME` - Name of storage account\r\n* `AZ_ACCOUNT_KEY` - Account key\r\n* `AZ_CONTAINER_NAME` - Optional. Defaults to `test-ow-travis`\r\n\r\nAnother test is being implemented based on [Azurite Simulator][2]. However currently due to Azure/azure-sdk-for-java#6140 (fixed in master but not released) the tests cannot be run against that\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4666)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR is closed since it is not required to introduce new variables to achieve reconfiguration of `application.conf` for `common`. Thank you @chetanmeh for your help!**\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nOriginal request:\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nExtension points for kamon metric key generator and reporter\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nWe need a different metric key generator and a different reporter in our product. Therefore we request two simple extension points in the `application.conf` for `common` that can be easily configured with two environment variables `KAMON_STATSD_METRIC_KEY_GENERATOR`and `METRICS_KAMON_REPORTER`. If the variables are not defined then Openwhisk will work as before and not change the current behavior. \r\n\r\nSo the main changes of this PR relate to `application.conf`for `common` and to the test. This PR also includes changes for exposing the two new environment variables to the deployment. Since this is a special use case and you would normally have to add code for a different generator and reporter it is the question if this PR should omit the changes for the deployment.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\nCurrent behavior of OpenWhisk only changes if the aforementioned variables are actively used.\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (generally a non-breaking change which closes an issue).\r\n- [x] Enhancement or new feature (adds new functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (a bug fix or enhancement which changes existing behavior).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] I signed an [Apache CLA](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] I reviewed the [style guides](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/wiki/Contributing:-Git-guidelines#code-readiness) and followed the recommendations (Travis CI will check :).\r\n- [x] I added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [ ] My changes require further changes to the documentation.\r\n- [x] I updated the documentation where necessary.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-07T11:39:36Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T12:39:29Z","closed_at":"2019-11-12T12:39:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"41397d9dd1f43000d22822411c129255d2183f0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4715/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/4715/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/issues/4715/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/statuses/03cd674b4fcbbc2b8ced65732e6053498b512bd6","head":{"label":"ruediger-maass:moremetricoptions","ref":"moremetricoptions","sha":"03cd674b4fcbbc2b8ced65732e6053498b512bd6","user":{"login":"ruediger-maass","id":27411569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDExNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27411569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass","html_url":"https://github.com/ruediger-maass","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruediger-maass/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7f7c164ec313b40e04c92e092bb8d83ddae60b1c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52039373,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjAzOTM3Mw==","name":"openwhisk","full_name":"apache/openwhisk","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/openwhisk","description":"Apache
