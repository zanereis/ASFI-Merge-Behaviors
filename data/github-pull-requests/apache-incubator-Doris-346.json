Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe current SqlCache sql_key is generated by taking the md5 value of `selectStmt.toSql()`, but `selectStmt.toSql()` is spliced through the operator tree, and sometimes some specific parameters cannot be displayed, resulting in sql hits with different parameters The same cache is used, and the query results are inconsistent with expectations.\r\n\r\nFor example, our user has a sql with more than 300 rows, which contains a lot of parameters, including partitions. But the result of `selectStmt.toSql()` is:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT `tb`.`type` AS `type`, `tb`.`name` AS `name`, `tb`.`name1` AS `name1`, `tb`.`name2` AS `name2`, `tb`.`name3` AS `name3`\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT 3 AS `type`, `cc`.`name` AS `name`, `cc`.`name1` AS `name1`\r\n    , coalesce(`bb`.`name`, '请联系您的品牌业务经理进行咨询。') AS `name2`, `bb`.`name1` AS `name3`\r\n  FROM `cc`\r\n    LEFT JOIN `bb` ON `cc`.`id` = `bb`.`id1`\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  SELECT `dd`.`type` AS `type`, `dd`.`name` AS `name`, `dd`.`name1` AS `name1`, `dd`.`name2` AS `name2`, `dd`.`name3` AS `name3`\r\n  FROM `dd`\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  SELECT `ee`.`type` AS `type`, `ee`.`name` AS `name`, `ee`.`name1` AS `name1`, `ee`.`name2` AS `name2`, `ee`.`name3` AS `name3`\r\n  FROM `ee`\r\n) tb\r\nLIMIT 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this way, the user specified different partitions for query, and the same cache was queried, which was inconsistent with the expected result. Therefore, it is recommended to use `originStmt` instead of `selectStmt.toSql()` to generate sql_key.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSupport integer types value in like predicate. \r\n\r\nThe basic idea is adding a rewrite rule to rewriete the expr of `SlotRef`, which type is fixedPointValue, aka Integer-Types, to a `CastExpr`, it will cast the fixedPoint value to string.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #6578 ) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-06T13:30:56Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T03:48:13Z","closed_at":"2021-09-07T03:56:52Z","merged_at":"2021-09-07T03:56:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"56b2a33a4d07cf36ad16a63bd243b758b2111b22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1705187220,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg3MjIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/planner","name":"area/planner","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThere are many historical job records in Doris, such as load jobs, alter jobs, export jobs and so on.\r\n\r\nThese historical jobs are generally cleaned up periodically by the cleanup thread, to avoid taking too much memory.\r\n\r\nThis PR reorganized the cleanup logic of historical jobs and optimized the cleanup logic of some historical jobs\r\nto reduce the memory usage of historical jobs.\r\n\r\nThe following FE configuration items are related to historical job cleaning:\r\n\r\n1. label_keep_max_second\r\n\r\n    Used to determine whether LoadJob, LoadJobV2, RoutineLoadJob or TransactionState are expired.\r\n\r\n2. streaming_label_keep_max_second\r\n\r\n    Used to determine whether InsertJob, DeleteJob  or TransactionState are expired.\r\n    Different from label_keep_max_second, this config is used to clean up these frequently submitted jobs or load transactions.\r\n\r\n3. history_job_keep_max_second\r\n\r\n    Used to determine whether AlterJob, ExportJob are expired\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR.

Proposed changes\r\nFix #6551 \r\n\r\n`Truncate` operation will create new partition to replace base partition. Tablets in new partition would be created based on table default bucket number. If the number of tablet for a partition is different from table default bucket number, the number of tablet will be different between the new created partition and base partition after truncate operation.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the new partition should have the same number of tablet as the base partition after truncate operation. Tablets in new partition should be created based on tablet number of base partition rather than table default bucket number for truncate operation.\r\n\r\nExample：\r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql> CREATE TABLE `table_test_2` (\r\n    ->   `event_day` date NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n    ->   `siteid` int(11) NULL DEFAULT \"10\" COMMENT \"\",\r\n    ->   `citycode` smallint(6) NULL COMMENT \"\",\r\n    ->   `username` varchar(32) NULL DEFAULT \"\" COMMENT \"\",\r\n    ->   `pv` bigint(20) SUM NULL DEFAULT \"0\" COMMENT \"\"\r\n    -> ) ENGINE=OLAP\r\n    -> AGGREGATE KEY(`event_day`, `siteid`, `citycode`, `username`)\r\n    -> COMMENT \"OLAP\"\r\n    -> PARTITION BY RANGE(`event_day`)\r\n    -> (PARTITION p2011 VALUES [('2011-01-01'), ('2012-01-01')))\r\n    -> DISTRIBUTED BY HASH(`siteid`) BUCKETS 10\r\n    -> PROPERTIES (\r\n    -> \"replication_num\" = \"1\",\r\n    -> \"in_memory\" = \"false\",\r\n    -> \"storage_format\" = \"V2\"\r\n    -> );\r\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.45

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis pr mainly supports\r\n1. Export query result sets concurrently\r\n2. Query result set export supports s3 protocol\r\n\r\nAmong them, there are several preconditions for concurrently exporting query result sets\r\n1. Enable concurrent export variables\r\n2. The query itself can be exported concurrently\r\n    (some queries containing sort nodes at the top level cannot be exported concurrently)\r\n3. Export the s3 protocol used instead of the broker\r\n\r\nAfter exporting the result set concurrently,\r\nthe file prefix is changed to outfile_{query_instance_id}_filenumber.{file_format}\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nBitShufflePageDecoder reuses the memory for storing decoder results, allocate memory directly from the `ChunkAllocator`, the performance is improved to a certain extent.\r\n\r\nIn the case of #6285, the total time consumption is reduced by 13.5%, and the time consumption ratio of `~Reader()` has also been reduced from 17.65% to 1.53%, and the memory allocation is unified to `ChunkAllocator` for centralized management , Which is conducive to subsequent memory optimization.\r\n\r\nwhich can avoid the memory waste caused by `Mempool`, because the chunk can be free at any time, but the performance is lower than the allocation from `Mempool`. The guess is that there is no `Mempool` after secondary allocation of large chunks , Will directly apply for a large number of small chunks from `ChunkAllocator`, and it takes longer to lock in `pop_free_chunk` and `push_free_chunk` (but this is not proven from the flame graphs of BE's cpu and contention).\r\n\r\nAverage time: 1032s (jmeter test, see issue #6285 for environment and configuration,  2021.10.08)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13197424/136552999-4cf97f6d-6796-43bf-87b1-32dd7cdedc75.png)\r\n\r\n## Some previous attempts\r\n\r\n### 1. Memory allocated by Mempool instead of Faststring.\r\n\r\nAverage time: 971s\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13197424/136556086-dfede2b3-7fd4-4f5d-9700-6041c7dd5850.png)\r\n\r\nBut this will cause the memory requested in BitShufflePageDecoder to be released uniformly when FileColumnIterator is destructed, resulting in a waste of memory.\r\n\r\n### 2. Reuse the Faststring object\r\n\r\nCreate a faststring object in FileColumnIterator, and then pass the pointer to each page BitShufflePageDecoder. The length of each decode in BitShufflePageDecoder is variable. If the length is insufficient during faststring resize, the capacity will be expanded, otherwise it will be reused directly. \r\n\r\nIn theory, the results of all page decodes in a FileColumnIterator are roughly the same, so there should be no memory waste problem. However, the performance of reusing faststring is lower than using mempool to allocate cached memory. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13197424/131029731-0e24ace1-e416-4bca-b6da-bd9b3dc138e3.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13197424/131029697-1ef301b2-6219-4264-85a9-43d127abdb17.png)\r\n\r\n### 3. Modify Faststring to allocate space from Mempool\r\n\r\nCurrently Faststring allocates space through `new`\r\n\r\n![faststring_test_all_no_leng](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13197424/126459746-ca039c96-14ea-46a2-b157-76c98030a580.png)\r\n![faststring_test_faststring_noleng](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13197424/126459767-b5bd54be-cca2-423c-8c06-a7beb0be0a25.png)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [x] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nFix #6512 \r\n\r\nIf there is missing replica for a tablet, clone task will be executed to restore missing replica from a healthy replica. Src replica selector will randomly choose a healthy replica as src replica.\r\n\r\nIt's better to choose the health replica with minmun version count as src replica so that it could avoid repetitive compaction task. In addition, replica with less version count is good for query performance.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [x] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAll the codes of the current commercial version of Doris manager are uploaded, including unified cluster space management, user system, cluster monitoring and data construction.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n  1. Add user unified management and user authentication functions\r\n  2. Add configuration unified management function\r\n  3. Add Doris manager data construction function\r\n  4. Add Doris manager monitoring operation and maintenance function\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n  1. The implementation mode of dm-server module accessing database is modified to use JPA.\r\n  2. The problem that dm-server module and dm-agent depend on the same open source project version is not consistent has been corrected\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n  1. The API document is modified to remind users that they can view all API information through the swagger document after the manager server is started\r\n  2. Added documentation for compilation and operation\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n  1. Three new modules have been added, general moudle,manager moudle and manager-server moudle\r\n  2. general moulde, It includes the general functions of Doris manager, such as user management, authentication implementation and configuration management\r\n  3. manager moudle,The core functions of Doris manager are realized, including Doris cluster monitoring, Doris cluster data construction and Doris cluster metadata synchronization\r\n  4. manager-server moudle,The unified main entry function module of all modules compiles and survives an executable jar package containing all functions on the manger server side as the output package on the Doris manager server side. At the same time, because it needs to be integrated into the commercial Doris stack, the creation function of Doris cluster space in manager is also realized here. It also relies on the DM server module, and the functions of the DM server module are also included after the output of the startup package.\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n  1. The three newly added modules(general moudle,manager moudle and manager-server moudle) have written unit test code.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAll the codes of the current commercial version of Doris manager are uploaded, including unified cluster space management, user system, cluster monitoring and data construction.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n  1. Add user unified management and user authentication functions\r\n  2. Add configuration unified management function\r\n  3. Add Doris manager data construction function\r\n  4. Add Doris manager monitoring operation and maintenance function\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n  1. The implementation mode of dm-server module accessing database is modified to use JPA.\r\n  2. The problem that dm-server module and dm-agent depend on the same open source project version is not consistent has been corrected\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n  1. The API document is modified to remind users that they can view all API information through the swagger document after the manager server is started\r\n  2. Added documentation for compilation and operation\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n  1. Three new modules have been added, general moudle,manager moudle and manager-server moudle\r\n  2. general moulde, It includes the general functions of Doris manager, such as user management, authentication implementation and configuration management\r\n  3. manager moudle,The core functions of Doris manager are realized, including Doris cluster monitoring, Doris cluster data construction and Doris cluster metadata synchronization\r\n  4. manager-server moudle,The unified main entry function module of all modules compiles and survives an executable jar package containing all functions on the manger server side as the output package on the Doris manager server side. At the same time, because it needs to be integrated into the commercial Doris stack, the creation function of Doris cluster space in manager is also realized here. It also relies on the DM server module, and the functions of the DM server module are also included after the output of the startup package.\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n  1. The three newly added modules(general moudle,manager moudle and manager-server moudle) have written unit test code. It is recommended to pay attention to maintaining code quality in subsequent code submission\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-20T05:11:50Z","updated_at":"2021-09-08T06:51:55Z","closed_at":"2021-08-23T03:28:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e695bf7b2a6e66afed7a5a192d1fd318be6076b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/6481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/6481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/6481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/41b92c2106322b3de10d86cc448ac41599247a8c","head":{"label":"songchuangyuan:songdev","ref":"songdev","sha":"41b92c2106322b3de10d86cc448ac41599247a8c","user":{"login":"songchuangyuan","id":46445562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQ1NTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46445562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/songchuangyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317406108,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc0MDYxMDg=","name":"incubator-doris","full_name":"songchuangyuan/incubator-doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songchuangyuan","id":46445562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQ1NTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46445562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/songchuangyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songchuangyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songchuangyuan/incubator-doris","description":"Apache
