Previously the S3 key (which is used as the table location in Hive) was agnostic of database (cluster) or table schema meaning uploading a CSV to an existing table with the same name (sans cluster and schema) created via the CSV flow would overwrite the S3 key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to ensure that the database ID and schema (if defined) are used in the default callable. Not an undefined schema infers the default (database dependent) schema. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe Databricks DB engine is based on the Hive DB engine spec, but the result from `SHOW FUNCTIONS` is slightly different. In Hive it returns a single column called `tab_name`, while in Databricks it's called `function`.\r\n\r\nI changed the `get_function_names` method to allow derived classes to specify a different column name, and also made it more resilient by accepting any column name when only one column is returned.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI tested the response from both Hive and Databricks, and also tested that it works when the results have a single column with a name different than the one expected (in that case we still log an error, but return the names).\r\n\r\nResponse from Databricks with this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user added a filter with drag and drop feature flag enabled, it couldn't be edited because popover didn't open after clicking the filter label. The reason for that is that popover trigger component implicitly passes control props to its child, and we need to spread those props in the child component - which we didn't do. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13879 via:\r\n\r\n1. For Hive, rather than storing the CSV file as a text file (which is problematic since multiline fields are not supported), converts the CSV file to Parquet (binary format) which circumvents the issue and additionally should provide a more performant mechanism for querying.\r\n2. Simplifying and streamlining the import flow. Now all engines first convert (read) the CSV/Excel file to a Pandas dataframe (via streaming‚Äîremoving the need for temporarily storing a file) which which is materialized as a SQL database, thus the DB engine specs only require a `df_to_sql` method. In the case of Hive this is via a Parquet file. This should help with other issues (https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14020, https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13834) by using a Pandas dataframe as the interim type after importing (reading) and before exporting (writing).\r\n \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nAdding a new enum column to the query table which would indicate if the query model is limited and what the limiting factor would be.\r\n\r\n### Reason\r\nWill be used in the frontend for better user facing messages. Previously several users had complained that they had downloaded the CSV of a query not realizing that the query had been limited either by the dropdown select or their own query parameters. This column will address using backend logic to determine what type of limiting factor, if any, has been placed on the query.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nBenchmarking the migration using https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13561:\r\n```\r\n% python scripts/benchmark_migration.py superset/migrations/versions/b5676c717e8b_add_new_columns_to_query_model.py --limit 10000000 --no-auto-cleanup\r\nLoaded your LOCAL configuration at [/Users/beto/Projects/incubator-superset/superset_config.py]\r\nlogging was configured successfully\r\n2021-04-14 22:54:24,887:INFO:superset.utils.logging_configurator:logging was configured successfully\r\n2021-04-14 22:54:24,900:INFO:root:Configured event logger of type <class 'superset.utils.log.DBEventLogger'>\r\n/Users/beto/Projects/incubator-superset/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/flask_caching/__init__.py:191: UserWarning: Flask-Caching: CACHE_TYPE is set to null, caching is effectively disabled.\r\n  warnings.warn(\r\n2021-04-14 22:54:26,086:WARNING:root:ENABLE_ALERTS is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0.0\r\nImporting migration script: superset/migrations/versions/b5676c717e8b_add_new_columns_to_query_model.py\r\nMigration goes from 070c043f2fdb to b5676c717e8b\r\nCurrent version of the DB is b5676c717e8b\r\n\r\nIdentifying models used in the migration:\r\n- Query (0 rows in table query)\r\n\r\nRunning benchmark will downgrade the Superset DB to 070c043f2fdb and upgrade to b5676c717e8b again.

With this, users can create a new database using the `superset://` SQLAlchemy URI, and use it to write queries like this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM \"examples.birth_names\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Queries can also join data from multiple databases, or even move data from one to another**:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO \"db1.table\"\r\nSELECT * FROM \"db2.table\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe database can even query itself (not that that's useful):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- these two are identical\r\nSELECT * FROM \"examples.bart_lines\";\r\nSELECT * FROM \"Superset meta database.examples%2Ebart_lines\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The dialect can only be used if the `ENABLE_SUPERSET_META_DB` feature flag is enabled**, otherwise it will be blocked and won't even show up in the list of available databases.\r\n\r\nWhile the dialect can be use to join across databases, users should be careful with big joins and expensive queries. Filtering, sorting, limiting and offsetting are pushed to the corresponding databases, **but aggregations and joins happen in memory**. For this reason it's recommended to enable asynchronous queries in the `superset://` database, so that computations are executed in Celery workers instead of the web workers.\r\n\r\nIn addition, **it's also possible to limit how much data is read from each database** via the `SUPERSET_META_DB_LIMIT` configuration value, set initially to 1000.\r\n\r\n**The dialect uses Superset's security manager to prevent users from accessing unauthorized databases**. DML is supported as long as DML is enabled in the `superset://` database and all the related databases. **It's also possible to limit the databases that the dialect has access to**, by setting `allowed_dbs` in the engine parameters. Eg:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"allowed_dbs\":[\"Google Sheets\",\"examples\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![Screenshot

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes the popover dismissed when clearing select data. The cause of this problem is because the clear icon of react-select will disappear after clicking, and the popover component of Antd will capture the mousedown event, this event will determine whether the current target exists under the parent component(here is document.body) , if it does not exist, the popover will be closed, and at this time the clear icon no longer exists.\r\nAll select components which set to `clearable` under popover will have the same problem. So here I passed the `actionMeta` property, if it is a clear event, the popover will not be closed.\r\nFrom another perspective,  if the clear icon of react select always exists, this problem can be solved.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Before\r\n![Kapture 2021-04-18 at 20 40

SUMMARY\r\n- The recent changes in `sqlalchemy-trino` will make it incompatible to work with the trino version with 351 or lower. So it is important to notify users that Trino connector for Superset about the supported version of trino. \r\n- It would be helpful to include the connection string for the local docker environment as people might need to spend a lot of time debugging this. \r\n- Additionally, I have added the trino superset podcast link for reference as users might find it useful.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe're working on redesigning the \"Add Database\" dialog so that users don't have to type a SQLAlchemy URI or figure out which driver should be used for each database. Instead, in the new flow:\r\n\r\n1. User clicks \"Add Database\".\r\n2. User chooses a database from the list of available databases, eg, \"PostgreSQL\". This list is built based on the installed SQLAlchemy dialects.\r\n3. User types in the DB-specific information. For PostgreSQL:\r\n- username\r\n- password\r\n- host\r\n- port\r\n- database name\r\n- additional parameters\r\n\r\nThese parameters are passed to the backend, which builds the SQLAlchemy URI depending on the selected database. Since the logic of building the SQLAlchemy URI is DB-dependent we opted against doing it in the frontend, and store the logic in each DB engine spec.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, this PR introduces:\r\n\r\n1. A `BaseParametersMixin` mixin for DB engine specs, which can be progressively added to DB engine specs in order to allow them to be configured via parameters instead of the SQLAlchemy URI. The mixin defines a **schema** for the parameters (so the frontend knows what do prompt), and methods to convert between the parameters and the SQLAlchemy URI.\r\n2. A schema mixin, `DatabaseParametersSchemaMixin`. The schema mixin handles the job of building the SQLAlchemy URI from the parameters before validating a payload representing a database. This way, APIs don't need to be updated to support the new way of configuring databases.\r\n3. A new endpoint `/api/v1/database/available/` that list the available databases. Users can specify in `superset/config.py` a list of **preferred databases**, which will then be displayed prominently to the user (with logos, eg).\r\n\r\nWith this work we hope to simplify the task of adding a new database, removing a lot of the guesswork that is needed today. Users will immediately know which databases are available and what information is needed to configure them. And they will always have the option of falling back to a SQLAlchemy URI if they want or need.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nTemp fix for https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14175  with some light refactoring:\r\n\r\n1. Rename `DashboardFilter` to `DashboardAccessFilter` to be more specific---we should do the same for other filters too (`ChartFilter`, `DatasetFilter`, etc)\r\n2. Replace `get_by_id_or_slug` in Dashboard DAO with [the same logics used previously by the dashboard view](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/99a0c8a8a129502d6253e000c14db31ab8b0bb19/superset/utils/decorators.py).\r\n3. Added a new inferred column `status` to replace `published`, but `published` is kept for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nTODO: we should replace the boolean column `published` with a enum column `status` to support the long-term solution mentioned in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14175#issuecomment-821245852\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n####

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the mechanism we use to discover DB engine specs, switching to [Python entry

SUMMARY\r\nI'm not a python expert, but while trying to enable the gsheets API, I got the error `No module named 'google.auth'`. It looks like we need to add the extra require from shillelagh like this, but i'm not positive that this is the right syntax. I'm hoping CI will help me out, but i'll also test this locally to see if it fixes the issue\r\n\r\nAlso updates some documentation\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI, dev\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nSuperset uses `sqlalchemy_utils`'s `EncrytpedType` in several places in order to provide application-level encryption to text fields before writing to the DB. The model definitions themselves are currently hard-coded to use these types inline, which doesn't allow others to customize their configuration. The current impl forces the use of the current `SECRET_KEY`, for instance, which some users may not want. What's worse is that the model classes themselves have a direct dependency on the Flask app's `config` object, which makes bootstrap harder than it needs to be. This change makes a small push in terms of unraveling this ball of wax.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a factory, along with an adapter paradigm that allows Superset users to customize the implementation of the encrypted fields on their own. The default implementation is, of course, to use the same EncType+SECRET_KEY setup that is currently in use.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nThis was unit tested. Note that this updates DB migrations, however the existing vs the updated versions are equivalent.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nThe recent PR #13739 caused a regression causing mutated column aliases to be returned from the SQLAlchemy model in the resulting `DataFrame`. The bug affects datasets on BigQuery, Athena, Redshift and Elasticsearch/Open Distro. By setting the optional `key` parameter on the `Column` object ([docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/metadata.html#sqlalchemy.schema.Column.params.key)) to the expected column name, and later referencing that when renaming columns in the `DataFrame`, we can ensure that column names are mutated back prior to returning.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently column names containing restricted characters are returned. See the failed query and the column `COUNT_DISTINCT(str)` called `COUNT_DISTINCT__93439` in the Results tab):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/114532901-f9152d80-9c55-11eb-9062-7cd0e8525627.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter the change, the chart renders and the column names in the Results tab show the expected labels:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/114532989-1813bf80-9c56-11eb-8138-845cb2e46055.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + new

SUMMARY\r\nWe're restyling the database modal to group together the different items into two tabs instead of 5 and try to make it simpler for people to create/edit a database.
