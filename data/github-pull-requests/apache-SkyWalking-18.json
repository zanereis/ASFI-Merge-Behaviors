Fix <zipkin trace accept-encoding handle error>\r\n- [x] Explain briefly why the bug exists and how to fix it.\r\n     The HTTP request header Accept-Encoding informs (to the server) the content encoding method that the client can understand—usually a certain compression algorithm. Through content negotiation, the server will choose a method proposed by the client, use and notify the client of the choice in the response header Content-Encoding. It is to inform the server that I support a certain compression method, and when the web page responds, it uses the corresponding method to compress the data and transmits it to us, rather than

deployment, I found that this exception disappeared, so I concluded that it was an OAP problem. And I found that the exception is always related to the relation's  hour and day dimensionality metrics. Finally, I found that the `remoteHashCode` method of some relation metrics was not set reasonably and related to `timeBucket`. This causes metrics with the same entityId to be sent to multiple aggregators.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-21T11:43:47Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T12:48:52Z","closed_at":"2021-07-21T12:48:52Z","merged_at":"2021-07-21T12:48:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"3704567b21facf811a3122b89f39f3d7e6af7aef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283421094,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM0MjEwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":"Something

I deployed project **_org.apache.skywalking:hbase-scenario:5.0.0_** and found that its pom file introduced **_98_** dependencies. However, among them, **_4_** libraries (**_4%_**) have not been used by your project (the redundant dependencies are listed below). Reduce these useless dependencies can help prevent conflicts between library versions. Meanwhile, it can minimize the total added size to projects. It can also help enable advanced scenarios for this project. \r\nThis PR helps **_org.apache.skywalking:hbase-scenario:5.0.0_** lose weight :) I have tested the revised configuration in my local environment. It is safe to remove the unused libraries.\r\n \r\nBest

session mechanism is enhanced, the older `InstanceTraffic` data of `timeBucket` will always be cached in the context.\r\n   \r\n   And because of the logic of `combine` method in `InstanceTraffic`, we will continue to use the older `timeBucket` when updating.\r\n\r\n   This causes OAP to update `InstanceTraffic` and report an error after cleaning up the index related to `InstanceTraffic` that has

At the edge case, in low traffic(traffic < bulkActions in the whole period), there is a possible case, 2 period bulks are included in one index refresh rebuild operation, which could cause version conflicts. And this case can't be fixed through `core/persistentPeriod` as the bulk fresh is not controlled by the persistent timer anymore.\r\n\r\nThis PR should avoid the following exception in the low load case, especially when `bulkActions` is set larger than the number of a metric type.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/125873315-ec7ab178-e4af-4da0-ac9b-7787797d67b1.png)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-16T00:17:57Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T04:10:40Z","closed_at":"2021-07-16T04:10:35Z","merged_at":"2021-07-16T04:10:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"8df362b92934e44557da35254aa04317e76ea7c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Ax1an","id":28091237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDkxMjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28091237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an","html_url":"https://github.com/Ax1an","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ax1an/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hanahmily","id":1960537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjA1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1960537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily","html_url":"https://github.com/hanahmily","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanahmily/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":783582051,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODM1ODIwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/core%20feature","name":"core feature","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"Core and important feature.

Support envoy cluster manager metrics\r\n- [ ] If this is non-trivial feature, paste the links/URLs to the design doc.\r\n- [X] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [X] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [X] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number. Closes #<issue number>.\r\n- [X] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n\r\n### Metrics Name\r\nDue to the `envoy gRPC Metric Service `  integrated metrics info and all meta info into the metrics name for now, like \r\n```\r\nenvoy_metrics {\r\n  name: \"cluster.outbound|9080||details.default.svc.cluster.local.update_attempt\"\r\n  type: COUNTER\r\n  metric {\r\n    counter {\r\n      value: 6.0\r\n    }\r\n    timestamp_ms: 1625104746703\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI used `envoy_cluster_metrics` as the name of all the envoy cluster manager metrics in `OAP`and filter the specific metric with `MAL`.\r\n### Cluster Name(Upstream service) label \r\nBy parsing the `name` like `cluster.outbound|9080||details.default.svc.cluster.local.update_attempt` to get the `ServiceMetaInfo`. The format config is in the `metadata-service-mapping.yaml` which consists with the `node service`. Due to the given info only support\r\n`ServiceName`, `NameSpace`, `Version` for now. \r\n\r\n### Snapshot

Modify `org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.context.tag.Tags#STATUS_CODE` static field type from `StringTag` to `IntegerTag` and all plugins that used the static field.\r\n2. Add `org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.context.tag.Tags#RESPONSE_CODE` static field to hold response code value except http calls. And this tag is only used in grpc-1.x-plugin to replace status code tag for now.\r\n3. Oap server analyzer source add `responseCodeStr` field associated with response code tag. I don't think the same span will have both status code tag and response code tag, so if this span is a http call, `responseCodeStr` field value is same as responseCode field except the field type.","created_at":"2021-07-09T08:09:11Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T04:08:19Z","closed_at":"2021-08-14T12:17:46Z","merged_at":"2021-08-14T12:17:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b66f1e0a73bf6c107005be6d6acf040dc7cb6bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"EvanLjp","id":31562192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTYyMTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31562192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp","html_url":"https://github.com/EvanLjp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EvanLjp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP

[x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n\r\nWhen I used the mysql-connector-java SDK version 8.0.19 or above and enable `jdbc:mysql:replication`, I got the following exception. And this leads to no creation of MySQL related exit span.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28091237/124860162-c6c06580-dfe3-11eb-8724-35a64c496469.png)\r\n\r\nBy debugging the agent, I found that when I used the mysql-connector-java SDK version 8.0.19 or above and enable `jdbc:mysql:replication`, the `hostInfo.getDatabaseUrl()`result changes. And this leads to `URLParser.parser()` failed.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28091237/124860199-d50e8180-dfe3-11eb-85a1-e0a2673cf228.png)\r\n\r\n`hostInfo.getDatabaseUrl()` result in version 8.0.19 or above:\r\n\r\n```java\r\njdbc:mysql:loadbalance://**internally_generated**1620805591623**\r\n```\r\n\r\n`hostInfo.getDatabaseUrl()` result in version 8.0.18 or below:\r\n\r\n```java\r\njdbc:mysql:replication://127.0.0.1:3306,127.0.0.1:3306,127.0.0.1:3306/mer_goods_admin_sit?useSSL=true&useUnicode=true&autoReconnect=true&rewriteBatchedStatements=TRUE&allowMultiQueries=true&serverTimezone=GMT%2B8\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy reading the source code of 8.0.18 and 8.0.19, I found that the logic of `LoadBalanceConnectionUrl` class is somewhat different.\r\n\r\nIn 8.0.18, the hostinfo passed in directly from the `ReplicationConnectionProxy` was used.\r\n\r\nIn 8.0.19, the newly built hostinfo is used.\r\n\r\nInitialize connection:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28091237/124860343-12730f00-dfe4-11eb-9046-9820f532cd88.png)\r\n\r\nIn 8.0.18:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28091237/124860375-1e5ed100-dfe4-11eb-8fba-5ed396ca2f1c.png)\r\n\r\nIn
