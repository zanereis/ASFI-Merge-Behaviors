etc)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] add a `auto_reload` flag for `DataLoader`, which loads data faster in the first several batch compare to the default `Dataloader`.\r\n- (Don't know whether the test case is appropriate.)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\nNow, the default behavior of DataLoader is prefetch immediately after it is created, rather than wait for its `__iter__()` is called.\r\nThis behavior is compatible to MXNet 2.0's dataloader with `nopython` mode, since it really speeds up the program (~5% faster with my handwriting

PR is used to reproduce the `nan` output issue when running inference of mxnet's bert onnx export on tensor rt in fp 16 mode https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/19747\r\n\r\n**Steps to export bert to onnx:**\r\n1. build mxnet and run `pip install -e python/`\r\n2. install dependencies with pip `onnx==1.6.0 onnx-simplifier onnxruntime==1.6.0 gluonnlp`\r\n3. `cd export_bert`\r\n4. edit `export_bert.py` to toggle `pretrained=True/False` and specify `batch` and `seq_length`\r\n4. `python export_bert.py --layer=3` to export the model.\r\n5. look into `bert_model` folder and use the `*_sim.onnx` onnx export file. This is the final output graph which has been optimized by  `onnx-simplifier`\r\n\r\n**Steps to build trt engine from onnx file and run inference**\r\n1. use this image https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tensorrt\r\n2. `pip install onnxruntime`\r\n3. copy `build_trt.py` and `infer_trt.py` and the onnx files into the container\r\n4. edit `build_trt.py` to specify onnx input and trt output path and do `python build_trt_py`\r\n5. edit `infer_trt.py` to specify onnx and trt path and batch and seq_length and do `python infer_trt_py`\r\n6. step 5 will run both trt and onnxruntime and output the results by each \r\n\r\n**Provided trt files**\r\nI have also included two trt files that I generated by following the above steps so you can cut to step 5 above.\r\n`mx_bert_layer3_simp_1_16_pre.trt` means BS 1 SeqLen 16 pretrained=True\r\n`mx_bert_layer3_simp_1_17_pre.trt` means BS 1 SeqLen 17

Description ##\r\nSupport onnx conversion of `_contrib_AdaptiveAvgPooling2D`. Update onnx conversion of `softmax` to support `temperature` attribute.\r\n\r\nDue to some incompatible issue of mx-onnx conversion, currently we only support the conversion when `output_size==1`. Pytorch has the similar implementation: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/9711.\r\n\r\nBy inspecting all models in gluon model zoo, 16 of them has `_contrib_AdaptiveAvgPooling2D`. Out of the 16 models, 7 models use `output_size>1`, which are not supported in this pr. \r\nUnsupported models:\r\n`psp_resnet50_ade`\r\n`psp_resnet101_ade`\r\n`psp_resnet101_voc`\r\n`psp_resnet101_citys`\r\n`psp_resnet101_coco`\r\n`icnet_resnet50_mhpv1`\r\n`icnet_resnet50_citys`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist

Description ##\r\nRight now, oneDNN may choose a blocked format for the output of concat, in cases that may require additional padding (thus more memory). In (de)convolution we make sure to only select a primitive_desc which has the expected (from tensor size) memory size requirements, so the same has to be done in this case. \r\n\r\nUnlike convolution's, concat's primitive_desc does not support iteration over multiple implementations, so here I manually impose a plain format when oneDNN would choose a blocked one with padding.\r\n\r\nResolves #19586\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are

For example a `Categorical` distribution initialized with logit values, will show `prob` size as `None` untill `prob` is called.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nCategorical(prob: size None, logit: size (3,), F: mxnet.ndarray, event_dim: 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Another possible solution which doesn't need lots of code change is calling the uncached property within the `__repr__` method, which will force initialize it. \r\n","created_at":"2020-12-28T11:41:09Z","updated_at":"2021-01-01T15:20:29Z","closed_at":"2021-01-01T15:20:29Z","merged_at":"2021-01-01T15:20:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"c29281302f387ad703af549b1da6555d71341c8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR sets -INF as returned value in FWD for masked values in log-softmax. log(0) = -INF\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Change returned values in FWD log-softmax for masked values. Before returning 0, now returning -INF\r\n- [x] Remove duplicated feature: scale_factor & temperature\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nIn Backwards, the gradient for -INF elements should be +INF, but this would introduce numerical issues.\r\nInstead, I propose to set those with zero.\r\nSimilar discussion for PyTorch can be found

Description ##\r\nThis PR reverts gcc version update (from `gcc-7` to `gcc-8`) for unix CI builds made in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/afc76b0f82839dfe00f7cab04be6de3df94564fe. gcc8+ is known to cause memory issues #19623 #18501 . We did a RFC #19688 for the same, and as per community feedback reverting the gcc version back to `gcc-7` until we fix the root cause.\r\n\r\nWe need to install `gcc-7` explicitly now as ubuntu version has been upgraded by the same commit from 18 to 20. While ubuntu18 came with `gcc-7` as default, ubuntu20 comes with `gcc-9`.\r\n\r\nAlso, removing `apt-get install cmake` as `pip3 install cmake` already exists. Once tensorrt supports ubuntu 20.04, we can drop the [18.04 image](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/16e2b15f6e334ca88f29b9c14e55547df2c136fc/ci/docker/docker-compose.yml#L91-L100) and remove the pip3 installation in favor of apt (as apt install on 20.04 provides a recent enough cmake).","created_at":"2020-12-21T03:48:48Z","updated_at":"2020-12-23T01:33:38Z","closed_at":"2020-12-23T01:33:37Z","merged_at":"2020-12-23T01:33:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"dcd7e80a593dec3cc6f3460db81b532fb39b52c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"leezu","id":946903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu","html_url":"https://github.com/leezu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leezu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR changes the docker tag used in build containers to use a new single ECR registry (defined in a Jenkins environment variable) to retrieve and store build containers. This creates a unique docker tag based on the hash of the Dockerfile and all copied files, to prevent name collisions of build container names between branches.\r\n\r\nThis should allow CI to be more stable and faster because we won't have to rebuild the containers on every CI run (master branch already reuses docker images built nightly, but other branches can not utilize them because the dockerfiles are different.) \r\n\r\nA jenkins pipeline monitors the v1.x branch and will regenerate the docker images from a restricted node and push them to the ECR registry on PR merge.\r\n\r\nConsidering there are 60+ stages in the v1.x pipeline and each stage takes about 15 minutes to build the docker images, this would save us about 15 hours of setup time (2 executors per slave node,) so about 7.5 hours of actual instance hours.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-10T23:43:50Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T04:39:15Z","closed_at":"2021-02-11T04:39:15Z","merged_at":"2021-02-11T04:39:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f3da908d2617601c436d75b6a57f9247e843583","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR:\r\n- refactors nnvm_to_onnx to enable one to many conversions. It allows single NNVM operators to be converted in a subgraph of several ONNX operators.\r\n- adds correct support of FullyConnected layers with `flatten=False`, which are not supported natively supported by ONNX and TensorRT. It converts the operator to a subgraph composed of Transpose+MatMul+Add ONNX

Description ##\r\nMXNet will error out during the backward propagation if CachedOp is present in the computational graph. This blocks the  custom subgraph partitioning #18823 and the dynamic shape ops optimization #19524. \r\n\r\nCurrently CachedOp is used as the symbol executor (external CachedOp) to run the whole graph. It is also used as individual operator inside the graph (internal CachedOp) that combines with other operators. For backward prop, the external CachedOp should be invoked through [`CachedOp::Backward()`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/11a7903c09b07f741cf81191be77d48fa8f7f584/src/imperative/cached_op.cc#L1016) while the internal CachedOp should be invoked through [`CachedOpBackward()`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/11a7903c09b07f741cf81191be77d48fa8f7f584/src/imperative/cached_op.cc#L1130). However, currently both external and internal CachedOps go through [`CachedOp::Backward()`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/11a7903c09b07f741cf81191be77d48fa8f7f584/src/imperative/imperative_utils.cc#L91), which causes the issue. \r\n\r\nThe external forward CachedOp was recorded at [`CachedOp::Forward()`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/b1b50210f3a9befe421063d3878d43d03c15cf1f/src/imperative/cached_op.cc#L836), with name `_cachedop`. The recorded op is then used to create external backward CachedOp with name `_cachedop_backward`. Hence we utilize op name `_cachedop_backward` to differentiate the way we invoke external/internal backward CachedOps.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a

Description ##\r\nSupport destructors for custom stateful ops\r\n- Adds virtual destructor for CustomStatefulOp base class\r\n- Added new library C API `_opCallDestroyOpState` to call delete on CustomStatefulOp in custom library\r\n- Calls delete on customStatefulOp instance in CustomStatefulOpWrapper destructor\r\n- Adds static `create` API to CustomStatefulOp to create instances of CustomStatefulOp derived classes using `new`. This API takes variadic args and passes them to the constructor of the templated class. For example: `CustomStatefulOp::create<MyStatefulGemm>(count, attrs);`\r\n- Adds an example destructor to the MyStatefulGemm class and calls the new `create` API\r\n- Added check to ensure instances of CustomStatefulOp were created with the `create` API to ensure they are allocated with new (since `delete` will be called on destruction) or emit a suppressible warning message.\r\n- Added an example suppressing the message in the `MyStatefulTransposeRowSP` class\r\n- The `MyStatefulTransposeCSR` class is an example where the message is emitted.\r\n\r\nNow, when MXNet calls the destructor for the CustomStatefulOpWrapper class it will subsequently `delete` the instance of the CustomStatefulOp allocated with `new` and call the inherited class's destructor","created_at":"2020-12-01T08:36:21Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T21:35:47Z","closed_at":"2020-12-04T21:35:47Z","merged_at":"2020-12-04T21:35:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"35cab31c89170023ae5d0b305af962bb84caefe0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/r

Description ##\r\nAdds a CPU kernel for LayerNorm that handles the common case of axis = -1.  This is based upon the implementation from Marian at https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev/blob/3b468e462809fe42a01a717c8d9307c465e6c35e/src/tensors/cpu/tensor_operators.cpp#L1047-L1087 .  \r\n\r\nCompared to the MXNet-internal generic implementation, the kernel is 1.6-29x faster.  When used in Sockeye, end-to-end translation is 14%.\r\nCompared to the MKL implementation, the kernel is 0.9-2.28x faster.  Marian's is faster than MKL for all channels tested wider than 32.  \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage.

Since float16 only exists in conversion on CPU, this is faster anyway.  Also, there wasn't an OMP reduction for float16.  \r\n- There is no threaded parallelization within a channel (i.e. to sum).  I doubt existing channel sizes justify this given the cost of threading on CPUs.

Description ##\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/19595\r\n\r\nThere was an index offset bug in the branch responsible for large arrays. The bug was introduced when rewriting the `zip_source_buffer_fragment_create` functionality of libzip for miniz. This functionality is important to write multiple buffers (npy header buffer and data buffer) to the same zip entry without extra memory allocation. miniz is more \"lowlevel\" and doesn't contain such convenience API (but supports inplace appending to a zipfile which is important for writing multiple arrays to same npz file).\r\n\r\nTurns out the CI didn't test saving large arrays and this bug went unnoticed.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-30T04:50:33Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T23:10:40Z","closed_at":"2020-11-30T23:10:36Z","merged_at":"2020-11-30T23:10:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"78fc40f68e062258f6897987e8b93686f47af85a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds `BN + ReLU` -> `BatchNormReLU` fuse into MKLDNN backend. It results in speedup of Resnet V2 models since they don't only have `conv+bn+relu` patterns but also `bn+relu` without convolution before it.\r\n\r\nApproximate speedups measured on i9 machine:\r\n```\r\nresnet18_v2: 5.0%\r\nresnet50_v2: 11.6%\r\nresnet101_v2: 10.9%\r\nresnet152_v2: 10.4%\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added `mkldnn_bn_relu_property`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This fuse can be added also to `MKLDNN_QUANTIZE` backend once we restore quantization files and test it\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-23T08:30:48Z","updated_at":"2020-11-29T01:19:59Z","closed_at":"2020-11-29T01:19:58Z","merged_at":"2020-11-29T01:19:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"748e100929bd2e862c4a808531478e4ccf35d8ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nv1.x branch version of PoC for saving & loading Gluon Blocks & HybridBlocks from #19535. Version for master branch is #19564. This PR is fundamentally different due to the changes on the master branch for block names/UUIDs compared to v1.x\r\n\r\nThis PR adds 2 new APIs to Gluon Blocks:\r\n\r\n### save\r\nSaves the model parameters and a json structure of the model that stores the names of blocks' children in order to later restore and match the saved parameters. This does not actually store the model. Users still need to recreate their model architecture using their Gluon code in Python. \r\n\r\nIt also stores the hybridized Symbol objects for HybridBlocks and associated settings so that it can be later reloaded.\r\n\r\n### load\r\nLoads the model parameters and a json structure of the model. It restores the names of blocks' children in order to match the saved parameters.\r\n\r\nAlso restores hybridized Symbol objects in HybridBlocks so they do not need to be hybridized again. After calling the `load` API users can immediately run inference without needing to hybridize.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-19T08:02:13Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T18:12:41Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T18:12:41Z","merged_at":"2020-12-15T18:12:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5fd18a139649e411bce19fdad552ef60bc6d2c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nmaster branch version of PoC for saving & loading Gluon Blocks & HybridBlocks from #19535. Version for v1.x is #19565. This PR is fundamentally different due to the changes on the master branch for block names/UUIDs compared to v1.x\r\n\r\nThis PR adds 2 new APIs to Gluon Blocks:\r\n\r\n### save\r\nSaves the model parameters and a json structure of the model that stores the various names/UUIDs in order to later restore and match the saved parameters. This does not actually store the model. Users still need to recreate their model architecture using their Gluon code in Python. \r\n\r\nIt also stores the hybridized Symbol objects for HybridBlocks and associated settings so that it can be later reloaded.\r\n\r\n### load\r\nLoads the model parameters and a json structure of the model. It restores the names/UUIDs of blocks in order to match the saved parameters.\r\n\r\nAlso restores hybridized Symbol objects in HybridBlocks so they do not need to be hybridized again. After calling the `load` API users can immediately run inference without needing to hybridize.\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n- renames `load_json` function in Symbol namespace to `fromjson` to match the corresponding `tojson` API\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-19T08:02:09Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T19:06:40Z","closed_at":"2020-12-14T19:06:40Z","merged_at":"2020-12-14T19:06:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"765297bf5d00054fdc40f8987e8238fcfa5eca60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe change integrates oneDNNs implementation of forward and backward propagation of Layer Normalization for axis == -1 (default case - last axis).\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nAs oneDNNs LayerNorm primitive does not support axis parameter (https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_layer_normalization.html) I had to modify input data by adjusting tensors in mxnet before sending them to oneDNN to make it work with axis != -1. I tried two approaches:\r\n1. Create custom memory descriptors for tensors with adjusted shapes and strides to make layer normalization operate along different axis.\r\n2. Reorder tensors before and after using layer normalization primitive.\r\n\r\nBoth approaches turned out to be significantly slower than current mxnet implementation.\r\n\r\nOneDNNs backward propagation is significantly faster than current mxnet's implementation. Forward implementation has similar performance to mxnet's generic version - depending on shape at times faster is marian and at times faster is oneDNN. As the difference in performance is significant in some of these cases I introduced simple heuristics (based on huge amount of benchmarking) for checking if layer normalization should be computed by oneDNN:\r\n```\r\n  auto ShapeBetterForMKLDNN = [](const mxnet::TShape& shape) {\r\n    constexpr size_t shapeLimit = 1024;\r\n    return shape.Size() / shape[0] >= shapeLimit && shape[0] >= shapeLimit;\r\n  };\r\n```\r\nThe above function can be found in mkldnn_layer_norm.cc file.\r\n\r\n### Most recent performance numbers

PR regards integrating oneDNN matmul primitive into the default execution path for dot forward pass in mxnet. This primitive is integrated only to forward pass as it does not have backward pass.\r\n\r\nLink to oneDNN matmul dev guide:\r\nhttps://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_matmul.html\r\n\r\nI was considering two versions of implementation for cases with transposition: first one with explicit reorder and second one with special memory descriptors for transposed tensors to avoid the reorder. Performance results (measured with opperf on clx-8280 machine) are below. As the performance is better for version with special descriptors I chose this version.\r\n\r\n<html
