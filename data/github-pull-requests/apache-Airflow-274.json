sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3618\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] The airflow.models.connection.Connection class function get_hook did not work as expected. The `conn_type` was not guaranteed to be lower case, and the get_hook function expected all lowercase type names. By updating the code so that the conditionals used `self.conn_type.lower()` instead of just `self.conn_type`, we can now make sure that the conditionals match the expected. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n>>> import airflow\r\n>>> from airflow.hooks.base_hook import BaseHook\r\n>>> airflow.__version__\r\n'1.10.1'\r\n>>> conn = BaseHook.get_connection('test_local_mysql')\r\n[2019-01-02 11:36:15,530] {base_hook.py:83} INFO - Using connection to: localhost\r\n>>> conn.conn_type\r\n'MySQL'\r\n>>> type(conn.get_hook())\r\n<class 'NoneType'>\r\n>>> conn.conn_type = conn.conn_type.lower()\r\n>>> conn.conn_type\r\n'mysql'\r\n>>> type(conn.get_hook())\r\n<class 'airflow.hooks.mysql_hook.MySqlHook'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Does not need tests as it is updating existing functionality which should already have test associated.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

setting the AWS region in the `EmrCreateJobFlowOperator` so that we can create an EMR job flow in any region.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAmending [test](https://github.com/danabananarama/incubator-airflow/blob/c451cedc3b760059c04293b25772c42db7917f10/tests/contrib/operators/test_emr_create_job_flow_operator.py#L81), did not add new test for functionality as it's essentially just persisting a new init param. Let me know if a new test needs to be added!\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-02T04:03:38Z","updated_at":"2019-01-06T22:12:02Z","closed_at":"2019-01-06T21:51:01Z","merged_at":"2019-01-06T21:51:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"3d5160fc808a9c8053dfc6b47d22a1eafeccec01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c451cedc3b760059c04293b25772c42db7917f10","head":{"label":"danabananarama:AIRFLOW-3610_set_job_flow_region","ref":"AIRFLOW-3610_set_job_flow_region","sha":"c451cedc3b760059c04293b25772c42db7917f10","user":{"login":"danabananarama","id":16157250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTU3MjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16157250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama","html_url":"https://github.com/danabananarama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163789104,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM3ODkxMDQ=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"danabananarama/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"danabananarama","id":16157250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTU3MjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16157250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama","html_url":"https://github.com/danabananarama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danabananarama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/danabananarama/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3609\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen running integration tests on a k8s cluster vs. Minikube\r\nI discovered that we were actually using an invalid permission\r\nstructure for our persistent volume. This commit fixes that.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-01T17:57:07Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T06:01:19Z","closed_at":"2019-01-02T05:55:43Z","merged_at":"2019-01-02T05:55:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4f55fdc2c3058d9709633e76c8efab311809ebd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4417/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4417/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4417/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/47a9562d509f8b6e088b2c7a7ae489d95e05a894","head":{"label":"dimberman:pv-fix","ref":"pv-fix","sha":"47a9562d509f8b6e088b2c7a7ae489d95e05a894","user":{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104245736,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQyNDU3MzY=","name":"airflow","full_name":"dimberman/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3608\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTo help move away from Minikube, we need to remove the dependency on\r\na local docker registry and move towards a solution that can be used\r\nin any kubernetes cluster. Custom image names allow users to use\r\nsystems like docker, artifactory and gcr\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-01T17:48:43Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T07:45:17Z","closed_at":"2019-01-02T07:40:23Z","merged_at":"2019-01-02T07:40:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"6bb88fab1eef05a0280527fdbea71da149967ba1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3011e194a044a48ec82f83bdeea0e7f9f7f0a388","head":{"label":"dimberman:custom-airflow-images","ref":"custom-airflow-images","sha":"3011e194a044a48ec82f83bdeea0e7f9f7f0a388","user":{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104245736,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQyNDU3MzY=","name":"airflow","full_name":"dimberman/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a hint to the reader about where to source the image used in the example Kubernetes yaml files. I wrongly assumed that `airflow` referenced an official image, and did not realise I had to build my own.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo code changes.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n\r\nNo code

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3605\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdded logic to load AirflowPlugins from the [entry_points](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#id16). Rather than moving files on the OS, this allows plugins to be installed and distributed via `pip`. \r\n\r\nAlso added a callback to execute business logic from the plugin when the plugin is loaded.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n - `plugins_manager.PluginsEntrypointLoad`\r\n - `plugins_manager.PluginsTestValidator`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n~I

condition checks (introduced in \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4368) will always pass, and are not necessary.\r\n\r\n**Reasoning:**\r\n\r\n- if `\"all_dags\" in filter_dag_ids == True`, `filter_dag_ids` will be updated into a list of all DAG IDs (no `\"all_dags\"` inside)\r\n- if `\"all_dags\" in filter_dag_ids == False`, `filter_dag_ids` will not be touched. It will still be a set of DAG IDs, or empty set.\r\n\r\nIn either case,\r\n- there is no point to check whether `\"all_dags\"` is in `filter_dag_ids`, because for sure it will not.\r\n- then what's the point to check `dag_id in filter_dag_ids` in a `for loop` of `for dag_id in filter_dag_ids`?\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3581\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n \r\nThis PR makes next_ds get set to execution_date for manually triggered runs instead of the next schedule-interval aligned execution date so that cron-like semantics are possible (i.e. having execution be aligned to the left side of the scheduling interval by using next_ds instead of execution_date in templates. Using the next schedule interval aligned execution date doesn't make sense for manually triggered runs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

necessary, given it's not used anywhere in the `'/delete'` method in either `airflow/www/views.py` or `airflow/www_rbac/views.py`.\r\n\r\n**Please correct me if I'm incorrect about this or missed anything.**\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-27T13:52:10Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T06:50:34Z","closed_at":"2019-01-02T05:56:33Z","merged_at":"2019-01-02T05:56:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ee926618aa709bd4d74d55c990db7780de23488","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4380/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4380/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4380/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1e87643a0ded32b85c21def4e8ab59606e187ff4","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:remove_unnecessary_arg_root","ref":"remove_unnecessary_arg_root","sha":"1e87643a0ded32b85c21def4e8ab59606e187ff4","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\nPure doc change\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n**Fix-1:**\r\nHow `AppBuilderBaseView` should be imported was not included in the example code of `plugins.rst`. This may confuse users (in the whole codebase, the only location in which this was mentioned is `tests/plugins/test_plugin.py`. Normal users of Airflow may not get to know it).\r\n\r\n**Fix-2:**\r\nTo add Plugin View for RBAC UI, we need to specify `default_view` in the class of `appbuilder_views`. If we don't specify it, the webserver process will fail (tested in runtime) (reference-1: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/tests/plugins/test_plugin.py#L74, reference-2: https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/master/flask_appbuilder/baseviews.py#L76).\r\n\r\n### Test\r\n\r\nI added `[ci skip]` to skip CI test, given this is just doc

Jira\r\n\r\nPure doc change\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFix-1:\r\nHow `AppBuilderBaseView` should be imported was not included in the example code of `plugins.rst`. This may confuse users (in the whole codebase, the only location in which this was mentioned is `tests/plugins/test_plugin.py`. Normal users of Airflow may not get to know it).\r\n\r\nFix-2:\r\nTo add Plugin View for RBAC UI, we need to specify `default_view` in the class of `appbuilder_views`. Otherwise the whole webserver process would fail (tested in runtime).\r\n\r\n#### Reference:\r\nreference-1 for fix-2:

Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3569\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n#### What this PR is addressing?\r\nCurrently, the (manual) Trigger DAG button is only available at the /home page.\r\n\r\nBut I always encounter this situation: when I'm checking the tree view, or code, or graph view of a specific DAG, I may want to manually trigger another DagRun. I need to go back to the home page, search for that DAG, trigger the DagRun, then click it again to check the tree view.\r\n\r\nIt may be good if we can have the Manual Trigger DAG button in the DAG page as well, rather than only in the home page.\r\n\r\n#### Others\r\n1. **This PR only updated `/www_rbac`**. Given deprecating old UI (`/www`) is already in the plan (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4339), updating `/www` may add extra re-basing work for https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4339. But kindly let me know if any committer finds it's still necessary to update `/www`. \r\n\r\n2.

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2939\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3568\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n - A task created by GoogleCloudStorageToS3Operator or S3ToGoogleCloudStorageOperator always fail due to a type error `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`.\r\n - `model.py` tries to push the return value from the operators, which is a file list as set, to xcom but xcom_push does not support set.  According to the traceback `model.py` internally uses `json.dumps(value).encode` but it does not support `set` since `set` is not JSON serializable\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/airflow/airflow/models.py\", line 1637, in _run_raw_tas\r\n    self.xcom_push(key=XCOM_RETURN_KEY, value=result\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/airflow/airflow/models.py\", line 1983, in xcom_pus\r\n    execution_date=execution_date or self.execution_date\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/airflow/airflow/utils/db.py\", line 74, in wrappe\r\n    return func(*args, **kwargs\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/airflow/airflow/models.py\", line 4531, in se\r\n    value = json.dumps(value).encode('UTF-8'\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/json/__init__.py\", line 231, in dump\r\n    return _default_encoder.encode(obj\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/json/encoder.py\", line 199, in encod\r\n    chunks = self.iterencode(o, _one_shot=True\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/json/encoder.py\", line 257, in iterencod\r\n    return _iterencode(o, 0\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/json/encoder.py\", line 180, in defaul\r\n    o.__class__.__name__\r\nTypeError: Object of type 'set' is not JSON serializabl\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] These operators has unit tests so my PR does not add new unit tests:\r\n - test_gcs_to_s3_operator.py\r\n - test_s3_list_operator.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3459\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMove the DagPickle class to a separate file as part of [the big models.py refactor](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=text%20~%20%22Refactor%3A%20Move%20out%20of%20models.py%22%20AND%20reporter%20in%20(Fokko)) (/airflow/models/dagpickle.py).\r\n\r\nAs a result of the refactoring, I also split off models.Base into a separate file.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nOnly moved code around, nothing new.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ X ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\nNo new functionality.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes

For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncross_downstream(from_tasks=[t1, t2, t3], to_tasks=[t4, t5, t6])\r\n\r\nSets dependencies:\r\n    t1 --> t4\r\n       \\ /\r\n    t2 -X> t5\r\n       / \\\r\n    t3 --> t6\r\n\r\nEquivalent to:\r\nt1.set_downstream(t4)\r\nt1.set_downstream(t5)\r\nt1.set_downstream(t6)\r\nt2.set_downstream(t4)\r\nt2.set_downstream(t5)\r\nt2.set_downstream(t6)\r\nt3.set_downstream(t4)\r\nt3.set_downstream(t5)\r\nt3.set_downstream(t6)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nHelpersTest.test_cross_downstream()\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-21T21:56:48Z","updated_at":"2018-12-26T10:00:09Z","closed_at":"2018-12-26T10:00:09Z","merged_at":"2018-12-26T10:00:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"c014324be237523d23ceb7a6250218d28befddfd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0bbf833f45f29c1c3f06bc456ec848551331150d","head":{"label":"BasPH:cross-downstream","ref":"cross-downstream","sha":"0bbf833f45f29c1c3f06bc456ec848551331150d","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f2113906d052df818cf14be8c513fada91caf26a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere is a limitation of UNIX socket path length as described in\r\nhttp://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_un.h.html#tag_13_67_04\r\n\r\nCloud SQL Proxy uses generated path and it can get longer than the limit\r\nin case of POSTGRES connections especially (POSTGRES adds few characters on\r\nits own). The error returned by sqlproxy in this case is pretty vague\r\n(invalid path) - it makes it difficult to understand the problem by\r\nthe user.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes it in two ways:\r\n* makes it less likely that the path length will be exceeded\r\nby shorter random string generated for the socket directory.\r\n* raises an Error in case of calculated path is too long\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\nCloudSqlQueryValidationTest:\r\n* test_create_operator_with_too_long_unix_socket_path\r\n* test_create_operator_with_not_too_long_unix_socket_path\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses [AIRFLOW-3547](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3547)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- This is a minor change to allow Jinja templating in parameters where it makes sense for SparkSubmitOperator.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- Probably not needed as it simply adds templating support to a few more parameters. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-20T05:35:46Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T09:54:12Z","closed_at":"2019-02-08T09:54:12Z","merged_at":"2019-02-08T09:54:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2fe587f59a082bde0e6059bc708a99cd4d5d442","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/233d4b8f49d103f93094142eda4e074e9c150121","head":{"label":"thesuperzapper:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"233d4b8f49d103f93094142eda4e074e9c150121","user":{"login":"thesuperzapper","id":5735406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU0MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5735406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper","html_url":"https://github.com/thesuperzapper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thesuperzapper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e60710657b134aeefe34c3e8d0a06107764cb8ff","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2082) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2082\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - The current docs indicate that password authentication can be added to the experimental REST API by adding `auth_backend = airflow.contrib.auth.backends.password_auth` to the api config. This fails with `AttributeError: module 'airflow.contrib.auth.backends.password_auth' has no attribute 'client_auth'`. This PR follows the suggestion in the JIRA ticket to simply add `client_auth = None`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIf there are existing tests around config, would be nice to add this in there. I took a quick look and didn't see any. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-18T20:41:45Z","updated_at":"2019-01-06T21:59:56Z","closed_at":"2019-01-06T21:59:56Z","merged_at":"2019-01-06T21:59:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"76e9fd746d8c90ad03b109005194bac18c96da99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4343/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4343/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4343/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/986a01fff139e5f0e0a87b9e72041af584d51281","head":{"label":"remix:password-auth-no-client-auth","ref":"password-auth-no-client-auth","sha":"986a01fff139e5f0e0a87b9e72041af584d51281","user":{"login":"remix","id":8146335,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjgxNDYzMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8146335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix","html_url":"https://github.com/remix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remix/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"11a36d17f22d89c97100c875cb01e8e6105a94cc","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3540\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf `~/airflow/airflow.cfg` exists, airflow uses that file instead of `$AIRFLOW_HOME/airflow.cfg`. This behavior is confusing--airflow shouldn't look for its config file in one location if it happens to exist there, else in another location. If `$AIRFLOW_HOME` is set and `$AIRFLOW_CONFIG` is not, we should only check `$AIRFLOW_HOME/airflow.cfg`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3303) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] We are using two different versions of UI in Apache Airflow. Idea is to deprecate and remove the older version of UI and use the new Flask App Builder (RBAC) version as the default UI from now on. (most probably in release 2.0.x)\r\nThis PR removes the old UI and renames the references of `www_rbac` to `www`. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Skipped some of the test case classes as these were purely using the older version of application and configurations. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n\r\n**All the help with manual testing would be highly appreciated 🙂**

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3458\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\nAIRFLOW-3458\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n1. Creates a module airflow.models\r\n2. Moves /airflow/models.py to /airflow/models/\\_\\_init__.py. This results in no breaking changes moving /airflow/models.py.\r\n3. Moves models.Connection from models.py into a separate file /airflow/models/connection.py and is the first of many classes to split away from models.py.\r\n\r\nGoal is to split models.py into manageable and logical files. Also see [discussion on mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/api/atom.lua?mid=3c15a871b15f99b4dd4bef25085b4de1c167c728f08262df73ef7217@%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E). This is the first PR of many in the list of classes to extract from models.py.\r\n\r\nNote I moved /airflow/models.py to /airflow/models/\\_\\_init__.py, this is a *temporary* solution as suggested on the mailing list to extract all classes one by one while not inducing any breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo new functionality.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\nNo new

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3529\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently all integration testing for the kubernetes executor takes place on minikube. This is simultaneously a lot slower and not accurate to real-world use-cases. This PR will create a one-step script to run on a real k8s cluster and write documentation for easier onboarding.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

larger DAGs topological_sort was found to be very inefficient. Made\r\nsome small changes to the code to improve the datastructures used in the\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3518\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhile running a larger DAG, topological_sort was found to be very slow. This fixup improves the performance on my local machine from ~5-10 seconds to 0.01s.\r\nMoreover, i've modified the __eq__ operators to have a shortcut for dag_id/task_id. This should improve all other cases where equality is used.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo tests, as I would expect topological_sort to be covered already.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes
