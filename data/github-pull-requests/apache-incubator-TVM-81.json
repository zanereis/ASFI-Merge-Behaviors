PR makes the autoscheduler sparse matrix registration code more specific in regards to input shapes. Instead of using density (as a two digit float) to discriminate between different inputs, we use all the input shapes. This causes fewer collisions between specifier strings. However, there are still two sparse matrices in the `deploy_sparse` tutorial that have the same specifier string. Ideally we would be able to use the values of the sparse matrix indices to discriminate between these two (for example, by hashing the indices), but the way registration is current setup makes this impossible. Instead we just ignore conflicts and hope that this doesn't cause a performance regression.\r\n\r\n@jcf94

PR has some bug fixes and new features for TRT BYOC.\r\n\r\n* Support scalars in explicit batch mode (explicit batch mode is when `use_implicit_batch=False`).\r\n* Support reduce to scalar for all reduce ops\r\n* Mark reduce operators as computationally intensive during subgraph pruning. Default TVM reduce performs poorly on Jetson devices, so we want to offload to TRT in those cases.\r\n* Remove deleted functions from module after subgraph pruning.\r\n* Support split operator (with unit tests)","created_at":"2021-05-03T21:42:06Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T20:02:02Z","closed_at":"2021-05-04T08:06:33Z","merged_at":"2021-05-04T08:06:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"0e3d850983d143f043183a68bd69b073c4288222","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7967/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7967/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7967/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/614338a1985cf3cbdc680f3e5d381980f02c69b3","head":{"label":"trevor-m:explicit-batch-fixes-4-15","ref":"explicit-batch-fixes-4-15","sha":"614338a1985cf3cbdc680f3e5d381980f02c69b3","user":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":204561313,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDQ1NjEzMTM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"trevor-m/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m/tvm","description":"Open

Bugfix, missing decoration on uniform buffer arguments.  \r\n  Caused segfault when running on NVidia GPUs, with models that required uniform buffer arguments for constants (>128 bytes of constants).\r\n\r\n- Updated test_target_codegen_spirv.py to use @tvm.testing.requires_vulkan\r\n  Previously, these tests would show success if USE_VULKAN=OFF.  Now, they correctly show that they are skipped instead.\r\n\r\n- Explicitly require int64 support at device creation time, since the TVM-generated shaders require it.\r\n    \r\n- Allocate an appropriate descriptor set pool size for the buffer inputs, including both uniform and storage buffers, when not using the push_descriptor extension.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-03T17:19:55Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T20:14:47Z","closed_at":"2021-05-04T11:55:23Z","merged_at":"2021-05-04T11:55:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb631a28e25e3c97531f84d7c011762ffe5f7caf","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7966/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7966/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7966/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c716a7f8f7b3d5f39f7b7ecd1155153169ecf837","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:ubo_fixes","ref":"ubo_fixes","sha":"c716a7f8f7b3d5f39f7b7ecd1155153169ecf837","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

Background\r\n\r\n* We noticed a discrepancy between the output shapes produced by Pytorch and TVM for a Pytorch network containing a single `torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d` operator.\r\n* When comparing the attributes of the `torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d` operator and the `tvm.relay.nn.conv2d_transpose`\r\noperator, the output_padding parameter in `tvm.relay.nn.conv2d_transpose` would always default to\r\n0 regardless of what output padding was set in `torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d`.\r\n* Upon further inspection, it was found that in `tvm/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py`, the import logic for convolution layers was missing the output_padding parameter.\r\n\r\n# The Fix\r\n\r\n* All fixes were implemented in `tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py`.\r\n* To resolve the missing padding parameter, convolution method of the\r\nPyTorchOpConverter class is updated so that when it constructed the relay convolution op it supplied the output_padding attribute in the cases where it was creating convolution transpose operations.\r\n* Over the course of the fix I also discovered that the convolution class automatically converted\r\n`torch.nn.ConvTranspose1D` operations into `tvm.relay.nn.conv2d_transpose`. This was fixed so now they were\r\nconverted into `tvm.relay.nn.conv1d_transpose` operations.\r\n* Over the course of the fix we also discovered that `torch.nn.Conv1d` operations were being converted into\r\n`tvm.relay.nn.conv2d` operations. This was fixed so that they are now converted into t`vm.relay.nn.conv1d`\r\noperations. There is a slight caveat where because tvm does not support grouped 1D convolution as stated in the\r\ndescription of `tvm.relay.nn.conv1d`, in that case we convert the operation to 2D convolution which does have\r\nsupport for grouped convolution. After the 2D convolution, we then squeeze the output to get the correct shape and\r\nvalues for a grouped 1D convolution.\r\n\r\n# Test Coverage\r\n\r\n* Extended the `test_forward_conv_transpose` test in `tvm/tests/python/frontend/pytorch/test_forward.py`.","created_at":"2021-04-30T23:45:56Z","updated_at":"2021-05-14T21:34:33Z","closed_at":"2021-05-14T21:34:25Z","merged_at":"2021-05-14T21:34:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa7bfe73d995969117326df39eb252e149b7a469","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3cae2d28e0b79ef6f1f80882671a537355c4185f","head":{"label":"Jeffrey-Sima:pytorch-convtranspose-padding-fix","ref":"pytorch-convtranspose-padding-fix","sha":"3cae2d28e0b79ef6f1f80882671a537355c4185f","user":{"login":"Jeffrey-Sima","id":77815538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODE1NTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77815538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363274651,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMyNzQ2NTE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Jeffrey-Sima/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jeffrey-Sima","id":77815538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODE1NTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77815538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima","html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jeffrey-Sima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jeffrey-Sima/tvm","description":"Open

autoscheduling a dense (or matmul) operator, sometimes the layout will be rewritten to have more than two axes. The shape function in relay only deals with this properly when the `units` attribute is provided. However, some of our frontends do not specify units when constructing a graph, resulting in compilation errors after autoscheduling. This PR adds special handling for rewritten dense ops to fix the problem.","created_at":"2021-04-30T23:18:00Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:54:52Z","closed_at":"2021-05-04T15:56:58Z","merged_at":"2021-05-04T15:56:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ed83b6f041cd15aa75c1ac0599d75792bdaae8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1a01e6b10c0a8922a704dd9e236c5ad7b5024340","head":{"label":"jwfromm:autoscheduler_matmul_shape","ref":"autoscheduler_matmul_shape","sha":"1a01e6b10c0a8922a704dd9e236c5ad7b5024340","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

After the pull request is submitted, please request code reviews from [Reviewers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md#reviewers) by @ them in the pull request thread.\r\n\r\nHi @altanh @tqchen:\r\n    I tried to integrate current passes profile mechanisms and make it more extendable, usage is as the commit's code example.  Many parts are inspired by LLVM and MLIR.\r\n   \r\n   How do you think? \r\n  \r\n   This is my first attempt to TVM :),   I have read through the guideline, but it there are stilling something

current sparse dense gpu kernel uses warp level storage to handling caching of data. Warp level storage uses shuffle intrinsics, which are slow on rocm (because they actually read and write to shared memory). Rocm does provide intrinsics to do the correct memory management, but they are not available through tvm. Instead this PR switches to using shared memory on rocm devices.

dilations to pooling operations:\r\n\r\nAs an example of what this means. Assume we have a tensor with layout N, C, H, W. \r\nWe have a pooling kernel of k_h x k_w and corresponding strides s_y and s_x. \r\nLet d_y and d_x be the associated dilations for the operation. Previously we had d_y and d_x implicitly be 1. An average pool is then:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13855451/116171050-e4588100-a6bc-11eb-837b-64b2bf08cd4c.png)\r\n\r\nMaxPool in ONNX supports dilation so this is important. It's also potentially useful for writing quantized conv operators.\r\n\r\nGeneral:\r\n   - Change *Pool -> *Pool2D to be consistent with *Pool1D and *Pool3D\r\n   - Dilation available for all pooling operations, change interfaces up and down TVM\r\n\r\nRelay:\r\n   - Add dilation fields to relay pooling nodes\r\n\r\nTopI:\r\n   - Consolidate 1d, 2d, 3d implementations into one ND version\r\n   - Consolidate 1d, 2d, 3d numpy ground truth implementations into one ND version\r\n   \r\nOnnx:\r\n   - One more onnx test passes B) \r\n   - Forward dilation field from onnx to relay for pooling

execution environment handles the signal by caching\r\nthe signal a state and invokes the handler when execution\r\ngoes into the python interpreter.\r\n\r\nThis model can cause problem when runnning a long running\r\nc++ function. As keyboard interrupt can only be caught in the end.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, because python registered special signal handlers.\r\nSocket operations can return EINTR that needs to be explicitly\r\nretried when the interrupt is not a KeyboardInterrupt.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following changes to resolve these problems.\r\n\r\n- Allow execution env(python) to register CheckSignals function\r\n  to the TVM runtime.\r\n- Add runtime::EnvCheckSignals to check the signal error.\r\n- Add retry when EINTR is encountered in socket.\r\n- Register the python C API functions in cython mode.\r\n\r\nTo testout the EnvCheckSignals, run the following code\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm.testing\r\ntvm.testing.run_check_signal(10)\r\n# press control + C\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the C API functions are only registered in cython FFI mode\r\nbecause ctypes have problems invoking these functions.

Arm reference board mps2_an521 is now added as a test platform to\r\ntest µTVM with Zephyr and that test platform runs by default emulated,\r\nplus Zephyr docker images were updated to use Zephyr v2.5-branch, add\r\nthe mps2_an521 board as a platform to be automatically used by the CI.\r\n\r\nThat change will allow testing µTVM on top of Zephyr running on a\r\nCortex-m33 MCU. Currently only a x86 VM is used for that kind of test.\r\nThis will help ensure that there is no regression on Arm-based MCUs.\r\n\r\nThat commit also adds explicitly the parameter --microtvm-platforms=host\r\nto the current test (x86) to ease reading about which test platforms are\r\ntriggered in the CI ('host' is the default platform when that parameter\r\nis ommited, so nothing changes for tests on the x86 VM).\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

Conv Transpose Padding Fix\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n----------\r\n\r\n*   we noticed a discrepancy between the output shapes produced by Pytorch and TVM for a Pytorch network containing a single ``torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d`` operator.\r\n*   When comparing the attributes of the ``torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d`` operator and the ``tvm.relay.nn.conv2d_transpose``\r\n    operator, the output_padding parameter in ``tvm.relay.nn.conv2d_transpose`` would always default to\r\n    0 regardless of what output padding was set in ``torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d``.\r\n*   Upon further inspection, it was found that in ``tvm/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py``, the import logic for convolution layers was missing the output_padding parameter.\r\n\r\nThe Fix\r\n-------\r\n\r\n*   All fixes were implemented in ``tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py``.\r\n*   To resolve the missing padding parameter, ``convolution`` method of the\r\n    ``PyTorchOpConverter`` class is updated so that when it constructed the relay convolution op it supplied the ``output_padding`` attribute in the cases where it was creating convolution transpose operations.\r\n*   Over the course of the fix I also discovered that the convolution class automatically converted\r\n    ``torch.nn.ConvTranspose1D`` operations into ``tvm.relay.nn.conv2d_transpose``. This was fixed so now they were\r\n    converted into ``tvm.relay.nn.conv1d_transpose`` operations.\r\n*   Over the couse of the fix we also discovered that ``torch.nn.Conv1d`` operations were being converted into\r\n    ``tvm.relay.nn.conv2d`` operations. This was fixed so that they are now converted into ``tvm.relay.nn.conv1d``\r\n    operations. There is a slight caveat where because tvm does not support grouped 1D convolution as stated in the\r\n    description of ``tvm.relay.nn.conv1d``, in that case we convert the operation to 2D convolution which does have\r\n    support for grouped convolution. After the 2D convolution, we then squeeze the output to get the correct shape and\r\n    values for a grouped 1D convolution.\r\n\r\nTest Coverage\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n*   extended the ``test_forward_conv_transpose`` test in ``tvm/tests/python/frontend/pytorch/test_forward.py``.

shape func related issues revealed in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7896\r\n\r\n* The shape func for `all_class_non_max_suppression` was not tested and had a trivial bug.\r\n* The model in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7896 had a `where` op whose inputs are all scalars. However, this function is fused with other dynamic ops and hence (?) we need to run shape func on this scalar `where` func. The fix is added but the test is not since it is difficult to manually construct such case.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the difficulty of running end to end model tests in ONNX frontend. Ideally I want to add a ONNX model in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/7896 to the test case. Maybe I can upload the file to https://github.com/dmlc/web-data but I found that there is no end to end test in ONNX frontend tests.

hardware plarform have multiple types compute chipset like\r\nGPU,FPGA,APU,RPU etc, there is a requirement that use these compute\r\nunit in parallel to reach best performance.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nIn these pipeline solution, we first split the compute graph into\r\na group of subgraph, then run these subgraph in a pipeline module\r\nto make the GPU/FPGA/APU/RPU parallel running become possible.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

TVM would throw an error if an operator was using SAME padding and also had a dynamic H or W dimension:\r\n`unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'Any' and 'int'`\r\n\r\nHowever, if stride == 1, then the input dimension value is actually not needed to compute the padding values.\r\n\r\nAlso added explicit message for the remaining unsupported case (strides != 1).\r\n\r\nAdded a test case for pooling, but this change helps all of the following operators:\r\n* Conv2D\r\n* Conv2DBackpropInput\r\n* DepthwiseConv2dNative\r\n* Conv3D\r\n* Conv3DBackpropInputV2\r\n* AvgPool\r\n* MaxPool\r\n* AvgPool3D\r\n* MaxPool3D\r\n* Dilation2D\r\n\r\n\r\nIf strides is not 1, we currently don't have a way to support the dynamic padding. I did some experiments, but it seems type inferencing through `dyn.nn.pad` is not sufficient because it doesn't know that only H and W dimensions are padded. Also, the output wouldn't be correct due to `count_include_pad=False`. So it seems we would need to modify all of these relay operators in order to fully support SAME or dynamic
