commit removes prepare_options() helper function because it's now\r\nsuperfluous since the default values for the project options are now set\r\ncorrectly at the server side, hence there is no need to force settting\r\nthem at the client side.\r\n\r\nAlso prepare_options() can incorrectly set the default value of Zephyr's\r\n'west_cmd' option when that option is not passed by the user. Hence by\r\nremoving that function this issue is resolved too. Here is a simple repro\r\nfor this issue:\r\n```\r\ngromero@amd:~/git/tvm$ bash -x t.sh \r\n+ TVMC='python3 -m tvm.driver.tvmc'\r\n+ python3 -m tvm.driver.tvmc micro create --force /tmp/micro_speech

Valid values: \"int64\", \"float32\", \"float64\".\r\nThe basic idea is that for some targets implementations other than \"int64\" (the only one at the moment) will be more productive.\r\nBelow some measurements were made on AMD Ryzen 7 5800H with TVM_NUM_THREADS=1\r\n\r\nPerformance with \"**llvm -mcpu=core-avx2**\" target:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14822750/147617463-700a044d-3367-4172-9ed1-18426c07fc55.png)\r\n\r\nPerformance with \"**llvm**\" target:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14822750/148706509-a4f358a6-b044-4715-acde-e2115b46dec1.png)\r\n\r\nAccuracy with \"**llvm -mcpu=core-avx2**\" target:\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n\r\nrequantize flow | accuracy\r\n-- | --\r\nUPWARD_float64 | 75,39%\r\nUPWARD_float32 | 75,32%\r\nUPWARD_int64 | 75,39%\r\nTONEAREST_float64 | 75,39%\r\nTONEAREST_float32 | 75,32%\r\nTONEAREST_int64 | 75,39%\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nAccuracy with \"**llvm**\" target:\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n\r\nrequantize flow | accuracy\r\n-- | --\r\nUPWARD_float64 | 75,38%\r\nUPWARD_float32 | 75,30%\r\nUPWARD_int64 | 75,38%\r\nTONEAREST_float64 | 75,38%\r\nTONEAREST_float32 | 75,30%\r\nTONEAREST_int64 | 75,38%\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n- Added relay.qnn.op.requantize_config to use it at python \"with\" statement. This allows users to control the behavior of the requantize function not directly. It accepts two parameters: rounding and compute_dtype. It has a lower priority than these parameters passed directly to the requantize function. **Note: compute_dtype will be \"float32\" for llvm x86 targets**. For example:\r\n```\r\nmod, params = relay.frontend.from_pytorch(scripted_model, shape_list)\r\nwith tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3):\r\n\twith relay.qnn.op.requantize_config(rounding=\"UPWARD\", compute_dtype=\"float64\"):\r\n\t\tlib = relay.build_module.build(mod, target=target, params=params)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Added target_has_sse41 and target_is_x86 functions to tvm.topi.x86.utils python namespace\r\n- Registered target_has.* functions from tvm.topi.x86.utils to call them from C++ code\r\n- Added Floor, LogicalOr, Equal, Less and IsFinite relay operations in C++ tvm::relay namespace\r\n- Added requantize_config validation

As a result, valid block configs are calculated consistently throughout compilation.\r\n\r\nThe fix for the api change is a cast to the datatype now expected by Vela due to using strict casting

PR:\r\n- Reuses minRPC implementation for hexagon to create RPC connection from host to hexagon device which is passed through android RPC server.\r\n- Adds HexagonLauncher which manages file upload to Android, initiate RPC server on Android and manage RPC session to hexagon.\r\n\r\nTo use this feature you need to build TVM using these configs:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake -DUSE_HEXAGON_RPC=ON \\\r\n       -DUSE_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/android-ndk/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \\\r\n       -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-28 \\\r\n       -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \\\r\n       -DUSE_HEXAGON_ARCH=v65|v66|v68 \\\r\n       -DUSE_HEXAGON_SDK=/path/to/Hexagon/SDK \\\r\n       -DUSE_HEXAGON_TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/Hexagon/toolchain/ \\\r\n       -DUSE_LLVM=/path/to/llvm/bin/llvm-config \\\r\n       -DUSE_CPP_RPC=ON \\\r\n       -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++ \\    \r\n       -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-stdlib=libc++' ..\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will build:\r\n- `libtvm` and `libtvm_runtime` using hexagon LLVM and`tvm_rcp` for **host**.\r\n- `libtvm_runtime_android.so` and `tvm_rpc_android` for **Android** under `build/hexagon_rpc`\r\n-

is a WIP of reproducing the functionality of the fuse_ops pass by using the pattern language instead. \r\n\r\nThe main goal is to replace the legacy fuse_ops with a cleaner and easier to maintain pass.\r\nAlso, we want to be able to extend it with pattern selection based on specific targets.\r\n\r\nThis MVP currently showcases the following patterns:\r\n* Max number of elemwise ops that can be fused together.\r\n* kOutEWiseFusable -> Broadcast* -> Elemwise\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a draft as I am still migrating patterns from other branches and assertions for IR structural equality are missing.\r\n@mbs-octoml @electriclilies @jroesch

main value of that change is enable qnn.conv2d and qnn.dense primitive for DNNL base json runtime.\r\nSome of these changes is useful for all type of workloads, not only int8 specific. \r\n\r\nTogether with that there was performed some refactoring of internal infrastructure of DNNL plugin. The main int8 unrelated  changes are:\r\n * Improved thread safety. Now DNNL runtime can be used in multi instance mode.\r\n * Zero copy input/output handling\r\n * Scratchpad specification\r\n * Use DNNL query api to define proper layouts (additional data copy is possible)\r\n * Indirect addressing of memory objects. Internal tensor registry allow to clone temp/const tensor depending particular thread id.  \r\n * Relative positioning of input arguments. Index of each optional arguments specified via attributes\r\n * Introduced ability of calculating constant subgraphs in DNNL code generator

PR:\r\n 1) Makes PlanDevices consider lowered calls when solving device domain constraints.\r\n 2) Connects the storage scopes on PrimFunc parameters (encoded in their Buffer data\r\n    Var type annotation PointerTypes storage_scope fields) to the memory_scope\r\n    fields of the SEScopes which PlanDevices unifies over.\r\n 3) Allows new device_copies to be inserted on the arguments and results of lowered\r\n    calls so as to acount for any memory scope mismatches which are now apparent.\r\n\r\n[device_planner.cc has main changes, rest is secondary.]\r\n\r\nIn the short term we'd like to use this machinery to flow memory scope choices made\r\nduring lowering back out into the overall Relay program. In the longer term we'd\r\nalso like to be able to use memory scopes to influence the lowering of\r\nyet-to-be-lowered functions (or lowered functions which have yet to been scheduled,\r\na distinction now possible with TensorIR).\r\n\r\n - Memory scope constraints can flow both out of and in to PrimFuncs\r\n   introduced by LowerTE. In TIR memory scopes are represented by\r\n   'storage scopes' on the PointerType type annotations on TIR Buffer data\r\n   variables.\r\n    - It is straightforward to extract memory scopes from PrimFuncs by\r\n      looking at the PrimFunc's buffer_map. We do this is 'phase 1' of\r\n      PlanDevices, which collects all the device constraints implied by\r\n    - However, pushing memory constraints in to PrimFuncs is more challenging\r\n      due to buffer aliasing. This aspect is still experimental.\r\n\r\n - Allow device_copies to be inserted for both arguments and\r\n   results of PrimFunc calls, on the assumption PlanDevices has\r\n   already established a consistent device assignment prior to\r\n   lowering and any new mismatch is required to match up memory scopes.\r\n   We use the new 'free' on_device annotations to implement this.\r\n\r\nComing along for the ride:\r\n\r\n - To make unit tests of mixed Relay/TIR functions possible needed\r\n   to be able to supply a checked_type to GlobalVar since that's currently\r\n   the only way to give a Relay type to PrimFuncs.\r\n\r\n - Use GenSym to get unique var names in ANF & partial eval so easier\r\n   to diff debug output between passes and connect program fragments\r\n   back into the overall program. Relying on pretty-printing to\r\n   automagically unique-ify var names is certainly cute but until we\r\n   have better span support is very hard to work with.\r\n\r\n - Realized both dead_code.cc and fold_constant.cc would\r\n   happily move values into a different lexical virtual\r\n   device context since device_planner.cc was being\r\n   'clever' and eliding on_devices for let-bound values\r\n   when there's no change. Fixed so that every let-bound\r\n   value has an on_device. Will be much better after\r\n   https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/45 is implemented.\r\n\r\n - Make build -Werror clean for clang-12 (mostly move fixups).\r\n\r\n - Address post-submit comments

this commit, newly added or removed source files were not detected by cmake. This manifested either as file not found errors from the compiler (when files were deleted) or packedfuncs not being found (when files were added). This commit uses the CONFIGURE_DEPENDS option of cmake's `file(GLOB)` function to ask the build system to check for new files on every rebuild. Checking for new files adds a slight but negligible overhead to each build, but is better than unexpected errors.\r\n\r\nNote that the cmake documentation recommends avoiding CONFIGURE_DEPENDS in favor of manually listing all files. This approach has been proposed in the past, but the community did not want to do it.\r\n\r\n@electriclilies @junrushao1994 @areusch @jroesch @tqchen @leandron

Even if on a workload that tensorcore can be applied, a generic direct algorithm (not `CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_IMPLICIT_GEMM`) is always chosen at runtime.\r\n```\r\n[19:36:21] ../src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/conv_forward.cc:278:    CUDNN Found 8 fwd algorithms, choosing CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_IMPLICIT_GEMM\r\n[19:36:21] ../src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/conv_forward.cc:281:            0) CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_IMPLICIT_GEMM - time: -1 ms, Memory: 0\r\n[19:36:21] ../src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/conv_forward.cc:281:            1) CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_IMPLICIT_PRECOMP_GEMM - time: -1 ms, Memory: 0\r\n[19:36:21] ../src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/conv_forward.cc:281:            2) CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_IMPLICIT_PRECOMP_GEMM - time: -1 ms, Memory: 0\r\n[19:36:21] ../src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/conv_forward.cc:281:            3) CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_GEMM - time: -1 ms, Memory: 0\r\n[19:36:21] ../src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/conv_forward.cc:281:            4) CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_DIRECT - time: -1 ms, Memory: 0\r\n[19:36:21] ../src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/conv_forward.cc:281:            5) CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_FFT - time: -1 ms, Memory: 0\r\n[19:36:21] ../src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/conv_forward.cc:281:            6) CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_FFT_TILING - time: -1 ms, Memory: 0\r\n[19:36:21] ../src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/conv_forward.cc:281:            7) CUDNN_CONVOLUTION_FWD_ALGO_WINOGRAD - time: -1 ms, Memory: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both of issues above.

Looking at the [doc](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/api/index.html#cudnnSetTensorNdDescriptor), I don't think it supports NHWC layout. There is another API `cudnnSetTensorNdDescriptorEx` which does take the tensor format into account.

boilerplate for generating conv2d kernels. Dynamic shape is supported. \r\n\r\nTo keep the diff small, this first PR only adds minimum code to demonstrate basic functionalities. In particular, activation fusion is not implemented yet, and profiling and kernel selection is done by piggy-backing on the existing GEMM profiler (see `cutlass/gen_conv2d.py`). The latter choice simplified the implementation, but as discussed in https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/discussions/358, we probably want a dedicated profiler and kernel selection logic for conv2d.

GNU/Linux`\r\n\r\n### Bug Description\r\n\r\nWhen compiling this model, TVM tends to do some type (shape) inference related to NCHWc. In NCHWc->NCHW shape inference, `c + C` will be evaluated.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38074777/143319870-d90a076c-f64d-4eb7-97bf-4cde64b9554f.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, model shape axis values are int64 but some other values initialized by default is int32. So here's a data type mismatch. This data type mismatch will cause TVM to fail in `ExprMutator` since binary operators require matched types. for operands.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38074777/143320278-b42d06da-d64f-4c00-bf9c-9fd3a3c1b277.png)\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nInitialize those artificial constants as int64 instead of int32 (`PrimExpr(0)` will be regarded as int32.).\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary><b>Full failure log</b> <i>[click to expand]</i></summary>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n```\r\n> INIT:: # Edge in this DSO: 1244181; # Edge total: 1244181\r\nOne or more operators have not been tuned.

these were in one workflow with `if`s on every step after some common setup. This pulls out the common stuff into a local action and makes macos and windows builds completely separate, removing the need for any `if`s to skip steps so everything looks little cleaner. This also has some minor cleanups:\r\n* use `submodules: recursive` on `actions/checkout` to avoid manually getting submodules\r\n* add a `concurrency` key so that pushes that happen before the job is finished cancel previously running jobs on the same PR\r\n\r\n@areusch @tqchen

an issue that causes strides to be incorrectly calculated when the number of channels in the input is less than 16 and involves a conversion from NHWC to NHCWB16. This is due to TVM being 'too smart' when analyzing generated TE and removing compute that is deemed unnecessary. Consequently, strides over data are incorrectly calculated leading to an output mismatch.\r\n\r\nThe PR uses a reduce sum operation to trick TE's data dependency analyzer into looping over a whole block (16), rather than the number of channels actually used (< 16). This causes the calculated strides to be a multiple of 16 which is required for NHCWB16 format.\r\n\r\ncc @mbaret @ekalda @manupa-arm @NicolaLancellotti

switch the order of some operations. This is to stop an edge case where casting a float with NaNs, or infinity leads to undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, casting a +inf to int32 led to the minimum int32 value on x86 (a 5900X - zen3) while on an m1 mac led to the maximum int32 value. This fixes this by moving the clipping operation to operate on the floating point values before casting to integer.","created_at":"2021-11-23T08:10:12Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T05:05:25Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T05:05:25Z","merged_at":"2021-11-24T05:05:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf1720869c07dd75319b9430a0021be0b1470f06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/9558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/9558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/9558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/717aa8e56385031ff93bae3204ef67dcd164e322","head":{"label":"AndrewZhaoLuo:aluo/qnn/fix-quantize","ref":"aluo/qnn/fix-quantize","sha":"717aa8e56385031ff93bae3204ef67dcd164e322","user":{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13855451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":350495744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTA0OTU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"AndrewZhaoLuo/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.git

is a grab bag of fallout changes from switching the VM to use LoweTEPass\r\nwhich can be ealy split out of the main #9483 PR.\r\n\r\n- AnnotateSpans can be used from C++ (though, unfortunately, it didn't help\r\n  me with debugging since spans are universally dropped in most passes).\r\n- Can get a human readable dump of the VM's PackedFunc names and indexes for\r\n  debugging.\r\n- If TVM_LOG_DEBUG defined then include types and ids of GlobalVars. I had\r\n  a lot of difficulty tracking down where duplicate GlobalVars for the same\r\n  name_hint were getting created and propagated.\r\n- GetCallLoweredProps follows same API as GetDeviceCopy and GetOnDevice\r\n  where will return 'null' properties if call/expr is not of call_lowered\r\n  form. Mildly more convenient, though switching all the above to ICHECK\r\n  and push 'if (op == the relevant op)' into all use sites would also be just\r\n  fine and I can be talked into that too.\r\n- Misc VLOG improvements made while tracking down issues in main PR.\r\n- Don't attach host targets to the CompilationConfig's 'primitive_targets' array. Since\r\n  Targets and SEScopes are compared by pointer equality, and the same Target with\r\n  and without a host are distinct objects, this was causing unnecessary copies in code which\r\n  is already dealing with the explicit host_target or host_se_scope anyway. I've left the hosts\r\n  in the legacy_target_map. (The sooner we sort out multi-target compilation and hosts the\r\n  better!)

PR aims to find a better way to set cuda arch.\r\n\r\nThe old style of setting cuda arch is too weird. You can only set cuda arch through \r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm.autotvm.measure.measure_methods import set_cuda_target_arch\r\nset_cuda_target_arch('sm_75')\r\n```\r\nThis is quite confusing because setting cuda arch has nothing to do with autotvm. (Please refer to the troubleshooting topic [Nvcc fatal : Value ‘sm_86’ is not defined for option ‘gpu-architecture’](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/nvcc-fatal-value-sm-86-is-not-defined-for-option-gpu-architecture/11422/7) in TVM Disscuss for more.)\r\n\r\nTherefore, we will deprecate`set_cuda_target_arch` api and bind `arch` attribute to `tvm.target.Target` object. The new style of setting cuda arch will be like,\r\n```python\r\n>>> target = tvm.target.Target(\"cuda -arch=sm_75\")  # or\r\n>>> target = tvm.target.cuda(model=\"2080ti\", arch=\"sm_75\")\r\n>>> target.arch\r\nsm_75\r\n```\r\nIf `-arch` attribute is not set, `target.arch` will set to the compute version of the first CUDA GPU by default. However, If your cuda version is too old, you may encounter errors during compilation. \r\n\r\nThus, it is strongly recommended to attach the cuda arch directly onto the Target object.","created_at":"2021-11-20T11:03:49Z","updated_at":"2021-11-25T02:05:04Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T17:32:59Z","merged_at":"2021-11-24T17:32:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"0195afc7e66df3afa973fe4b77eb7d9a1a699763","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Hzfengsy","id":25500082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTAwMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25500082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy","html_url":"https://github.com/Hzfengsy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hzfengsy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jcf94","id":12119698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTE5Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12119698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94","html_url":"https://github.com/jcf94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":

part of #9483 we need to prepare some critical Relay passes for running after\r\nlowering and conversion to DPS. For DCE we need to make sure we never remove\r\nside-effecting let-bound expressions, such as for allocation or evaluation of\r\nan external function with unknown effectfulness.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new purity pre-pass. It makes a half-hearted attempt at accounting\r\nfor functions by tracking both 'eval' and 'call' purity, but must fallback to\r\nassuming call-impurity in more difficult cases (eg calling a function passed as\r\na parameter, calling a function projected from a tuple, etc). However it seems\r\nplenty good enough.\r\n\r\nPurity must also be accounted for when determining the usage count of let-bound\r\nvariables, so reworked that. Collapsed the let-bound value accumulation pass into\r\nthe usage counting pass to make up for inserting the new purity analysis pass.\r\n\r\nNote that some unit tests assume DCE eliminates dead writes to references. The\r\nprevious implementation certainly did that, but also eliminated all writes. To do this\r\nsoundly will require a bit of liveness analysis. Rather than doing that now I've added\r\nan 'ignore_impurity' flag to DeadCodeElimination() to recover the (unsound)

fixes some rST issues I noticed while going through the getting started tutorial. Some of these shouldn't be too controversial like using \\` instead of `` and consistency fixes. I noticed lots of the `.. note:`s have titles even though they don't really render as anything special in Sphinx, but the base `.. admonition:` does render the title in the top line. This looks nicer IMO and wastes less space but it could go either way, I didn't change it in all places yet either until others agree.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9407960/142671849-b09cb0c0-5b1e-488e-a54a-023070493388.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9407960/142671862-41f5925f-40bd-4cfe-af94-6513a075eed6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

found a case where the input to `dense` op has a layout `NW`. This happens with the combination of `adaptive_pool1d` having `NCW` layout, followed by `squeeze(..., axis=1`) which removes the second axis. Currently we get an error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nE             Check failed: (tir::BijectiveLayout(new_src_layout, dst_layout).defined()) is false: Cannot insert layout transform because there are inconvertible layouts: NW v.s. NC\r\n```\r\n\r\nI updated `InferCorrect` functions to prevent such errors. But by now I've seen `NW vs NC` and `NK vs NC` crashes, maybe we should make those layouts compatible... \r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @yzhliu

is a draft PR implementing WithFields on tuples.\r\n\r\nWithFields is parallel to WithAttrs in behavior. It returns this* if all the fields passed in are the same as the ones already in this. Otherwise, it creates a copy of the tuple with the new fields. \r\n\r\nThe motivation for WithFields is to ensure that spans, checked types, and other fields on nodes are propagated correctly during passes so we can rely on that information. If we decide to go ahead with this change, I will also implement WithFields for all other relay exprs.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-18T18:58:20Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T18:22:42Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T18:22:41Z","merged_at":"2021-11-24T18:22:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c48caddd6af8381e8544ca9ab3cb182b3d7396f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anijain2305","id":13822661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODIyNjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13822661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305","html_url":"https://github.com/anijain2305","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anijain2305/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","use
