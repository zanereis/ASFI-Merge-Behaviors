current Python codebase runs subprocesses to call Python and pip. This is fine when not running in a virtualenv, or in a virtualenv that was activated through modifying the PATH. But it fails if running in a virtualenv either via an IDE (I use IntelliJ) or simply when invoking the Python from the virtualenv directly (which is a supported way of using a virtualenv).\n\nInstead of relying on the PATH to invoke a Python and hope it's the same python executable as the one currently running, Python provides a `sys.executable` variable (which gives the full path of the currently running python) just for that purpose. Using that, the code will work in all the cases described above.\n\nAlso, the recommended way of calling `pip` is now `python -m pip`, which makes explicit which Python is being used. Switching over to that at the same time.\n","created_at":"2016-09-15T19:52:31Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T20:29:08Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T20:29:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"219283481f7d19d9f66133e9d29e5f9338c91f01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/557265b1decd1611d7134ac0d73f0c70da2fe9e3","head":{"label":"chrish42:use_sys.executable","ref":"use_sys.executable","sha":"557265b1decd1611d7134ac0d73f0c70da2fe9e3","user":{"login":"chrish42","id":632858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjg1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/632858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42","html_url":"https://github.com/chrish42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68239820,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODIzOTgyMA==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"chrish42/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chrish42","id":632858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjg1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/632858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42","html_url":"https://github.com/chrish42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrish42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chrish42/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

trying to get beam to load into Eclipse (Neon) using m2e.   Currently, there are a bunch of compile errors which prevents it from building within Eclipse due to some differences between the standard Oracle \"javac\" compiler and Eclipse's ejc compiler with certain generics usages.   Also, the eclipse compiler complains if there are two package-info.java files in the same package (usually due to one in the \"test\" tree that duplicates the package from the non-test tree) so I eliminated the ones in the test tree.  \n\nThis is a start.  With this, beam will import into Eclipse, but then generates a TON of Checkstyle errors due to checkstyle checking the avro generated code.   You can right click on the projects and disable Checkstyle for now and beam will build/test within Eclipse.   I'm working on figuring out the checkstyle parts, but I wanted to submit this for review as this involves actual code

Refactoring up common functionality from TextFileSink to FileSink.\n- Removing no-longer needed overrides from TextFileSink\n  (since their implementation is identical to FileSink).\n- Introducing

NativeFileWriter.\n- Introducing NativeFileSource and NativeFileSourceWriter that capture the common\n  patterns of file-related native sources.\n- TextFileSource now inherits from NativeFileSource.\n- TextFileReader now inherits from NativeFileSourceReader.\n- Introducing CompressionTypes.AUTO, in analogy to Dataflow Java's TextIO.CompressionType.\n  This is now the new default for NativeFileSource, NativeFileSink, FileSink (and all\n  their subclasses).\n- Moving compression_type and mime_type handling to ChannelFactory.open().\n- Changing compression level from 9 to Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION as that better matches\n  disk/cpu tradeoffs.\n- Removing CompressionTypes.DEFLATE since it's not a standard on-disk format (and not\n  recognized by the service).\n- Augmenting the functionality of _CompressedFile and GcsBufferedWriter (supporting more\n  standard file operations on them, needed by various Sources/Sinks).\n","created_at":"2016-09-10T00:15:53Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T00:50:51Z","closed_at":"2016-09-13T00:34:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b62307431c475b04b4df20c756dbf01d6b372984","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/940/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/940/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/940/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/80aa51335e6d490c94e9bb4876c2f18cac1a0c49","head":{"label":"katsiapis:python","ref":"python","sha":"80aa51335e6d490c94e9bb4876c2f18cac1a0c49","user":{"login":"katsiapis","id":22107882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTA3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22107882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis","html_url":"https://github.com/katsiapis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67836035,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NzgzNjAzNQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"katsiapis/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"katsiapis","id":22107882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTA3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22107882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis","html_url":"https://github.com/katsiapis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katsiapis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/katsiapis/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

write text files.\n\nFixes a bug related to compressed files - we were not properly reading data due to end offset being set to size of the file instead of OFFSET_INFINITY when performing initial splitting.\n\nUpdates source_test_utils to accept sources along with a position range.\n\nAdds a significant number of tests.\n","created_at":"2016-09-06T06:20:23Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T04:38:07Z","closed_at":"2016-09-19T04:38:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ecf2a22108dcc387b7e57eb70d8467f55eb8e0d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/920/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/920/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/920/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/a869ed0917861bd4e5b3cffcd3726d68afff35a9","head":{"label":"chamikaramj:text_source","ref":"text_source","sha":"a869ed0917861bd4e5b3cffcd3726d68afff35a9","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61584074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTU4NDA3NA==","name":"beam","full_name":"chamikaramj/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj/beam","description":"Mirror
