What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to issue a `FutureWarning` for `(DataFrame|Series).interpolate` with object dtype.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo match the behavior with Pandas. Using object dtype for `interpolate` is deprecated and will raise exception in the future version, so we should issue the proper warning such as Pandas does.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nGiven DataFrame below,\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf = ps.DataFrame({\"A\": ['a', 'b', 'c'], \"B\": [1, 2, 3]})\r\n>>> psdf\r\n   A  B\r\n0  a  1\r\n1  b  2\r\n2  c  3\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf.interpolate()  # Excluding column with object dtype without any warning unlike pandas\r\n   B\r\n0  1\r\n1  2\r\n2  3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf.interpolate()  # Issuing a proper warning\r\nFutureWarning: DataFrame.interpolate with object dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future version. Call df.infer_objects(copy=False) before interpolating instead.\r\n  warnings.warn(\r\n   B\r\n0  1\r\n1  2\r\n2  3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo behavior changes, so the existing CI should pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-02T01:43:26Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T08:46:01Z","closed_at":"2024-01-02T08:46:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e339db13e737fe2721946e8c124ddfd88d4cfc58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace all `UnsupportedOperationException` by `SparkUnsupportedOperationException` in `Catalyst` code base, and introduce new legacy error classes with the `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` prefix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo unify Spark SQL exception, and port Java exceptions on Spark exceptions with error classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it can if user's code assumes some particular format of `UnsupportedOperationException` messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites like:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-31T15:25:49Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T15:59:53Z","closed_at":"2024-01-02T15:59:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"27e888afabc0db83c03e81869b8ddc2be201199a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSwallow non-fatal exception in maintenance task to avoid deadlock between maintenance thread and streaming aggregation operator\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change fixes a race condition that causes a deadlock between the task thread and the maintenance thread. This is primarily only possible with the streaming aggregation operator. In this case, we use 2 physical operators - `StateStoreRestoreExec` and `StateStoreSaveExec`. The first one opens the store in read-only mode and the 2nd one does the actual commit.\r\n\r\nHowever, the following sequence of events creates an issue\r\n1. Task thread runs the `StateStoreRestoreExec` and gets the store instance and thereby the DB instance lock\r\n2. Maintenance thread fails with an error for some reason\r\n3. Maintenance thread takes the `loadedProviders` lock and tries to call `close` on all the loaded providers\r\n4. Task thread tries to execute the StateStoreRDD for the `StateStoreSaveExec` operator and tries to acquire the `loadedProviders` lock which is held by the thread above\r\n\r\nSo basically if the maintenance thread is interleaved between the `restore/save` operations, there is a deadlock condition based on the `loadedProviders` lock and the DB instance lock.\r\n\r\nThe fix proposes to simply release the resources at the end of the `StateStoreRestoreExec` operator (note that `abort` for `ReadStateStore` is likely a misnomer - but we choose to follow the already provided API in this case)\r\n\r\nRelevant Logs:\r\nLink - https://github.com/anishshri-db/spark/actions/runs/7356847259/job/20027577445?pr=4\r\n```\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6362466Z 09:59:02.635 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStore: Error in maintenanceThreadPool\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6365616Z java.io.FileNotFoundException: File file:/home/runner/work/spark/spark/target/tmp/spark-8ef51f34-b9de-48f2-b8df-07e14599b4c9/state/0/1 does not exist\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6367861Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.RawLocalFileSystem.listStatus(RawLocalFileSystem.java:733)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6369383Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.DelegateToFileSystem.listStatus(DelegateToFileSystem.java:177)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6370693Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.ChecksumFs.listStatus(ChecksumFs.java:571)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6371781Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileContext$Util$1.next(FileContext.java:1940)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6372876Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileContext$Util$1.next(FileContext.java:1936)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6373967Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FSLinkResolver.resolve(FSLinkResolver.java:90)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6375104Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileContext$Util.listStatus(FileContext.java:1942)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6376676Z 09:59:02.636 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.StateStore: Error running maintenance thread\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6379079Z java.io.FileNotFoundException: File file:/home/runner/work/spark/spark/target/tmp/spark-8ef51f34-b9de-48f2-b8df-07e14599b4c9/state/0/1 does not exist\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6381083Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.RawLocalFileSystem.listStatus(RawLocalFileSystem.java:733)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6382490Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.DelegateToFileSystem.listStatus(DelegateToFileSystem.java:177)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6383816Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.ChecksumFs.listStatus(ChecksumFs.java:571)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6384875Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileContext$Util$1.next(FileContext.java:1940)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6386294Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileContext$Util$1.next(FileContext.java:1936)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6387439Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FSLinkResolver.resolve(FSLinkResolver.java:90)\r\n2023-12-27T09:59:02.6388674Z \tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileContext$Util.listStatus(FileContext.java:1942)\r\n...\r\n2023-12-27T10:01:02.4292831Z ^[[0m[^[[0m^[[0minfo^[[0m] ^[[0m^[[0m^[[31m- changing schema of state when restarting query - state format version 2 (RocksDBStateStore) *** FAILED *** (2 minutes)^[[0m^[[0m\r\n2023-12-27T10:01:02.4295311Z ^[[0m[^[[0m^[[0minfo^[[0m] ^[[0m^[[0m^[[31m  Timed out waiting for stream: The code passed to failAfter did not complete within 120 seconds.^[[0m^[[0m\r\n2023-12-27T10:01:02.4297271Z ^[[0m[^[[0m^[[0minfo^[[0m] ^[[0m^[[0m^[[31m  java.base/java.lang.Thread.getStackTrace(Thread.java:1619)^[[0m^[[0m\r\n2023-12-27T10:01:02.4299084Z ^[[0m[^[[0m^[[0minfo^[[0m] ^[[0m^[[0m^[[31m  \torg.scalatest.concurrent.TimeLimits$.failAfterImpl(TimeLimits.scala:277)^[[0m^[[0m\r\n2023-12-27T10:01:02.4300948Z ^[[0m[^[[0m^[[0minfo^[[0m] ^[[0m^[[0m^[[31m  \torg.scalatest.concurrent.TimeLimits.failAfter(TimeLimits.scala:231)^[[0m^[[0m\r\n...\r\n2023-12-27T10:01:02.6474472Z 10:01:02.646 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.RocksDB StateStoreId(opId=0,partId=0,name=default): Error closing RocksDB\r\n2023-12-27T10:01:02.6482792Z org.apache.spark.SparkException: [CANNOT_LOAD_STATE_STORE.UNRELEASED_THREAD_ERROR] An error occurred during loading state.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAllow group by on columns of type CalendarInterval\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, Spark GROUP BY only allows orderable data types, otherwise the plan analysis fails: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/ExprUtils.scala#L197-L203\r\n\r\nHowever, this is too strict as GROUP BY only cares about equality, not ordering. The CalendarInterval type is not orderable (1 month and 30 days, we don't know which one is larger), but has well-defined equality. In fact, we already support `SELECT DISTINCT calendar_interval_type` in some cases (when hash aggregate is picked by the planner).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users will now be able to do group by on columns of type CalendarInterval\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nBy adding new UTs\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Rough POC for collations in Spark\r\n\r\n## High level changes\r\n- Collation suite that test currently supported features (start with this file).\r\n- Global `CollatorFactory`. This global table represents stores all available collations in the system. It can provide collation aware comparators and hashes to the `UTF8String` function. \r\n- `UTF8String` is extended with single integer that specifies collation. We could be even more aggressive and pack this integer into a short, or even a byte. Id represents cached comparator id that can be fetched from `CollatorFactory`.\r\n- `UTF8String` respects this id for equality checks and compares.\r\n- `StringType` class is extended with collationId field. We keep using existing `case object StringType` to mark default, utf8 binary, collation. By doing this, we should keep binary compatibility with previous versions. \r\n- Extending `PhysicalStringType` with `collationId` field.\r\n- Support for aggregates, given that they currently rely on pure byte for byte comparison for group building.\r\n- Support for merge join (hash based joins are TODO).\r\n- ICU is used as collation library. ICU4j only exposes UTF16 APIs which means that we need to do UTF8 -> UTF16 conversion on every comparison which is very suboptimal. Alternative is to ICU4c through JNI which does support UTF8 APIs.\r\n- Unit benchmark that covers UTF8 operations with and without collators. At this point measured diff between collated and uncollated comparison is ~12x.\r\n\r\n## Supported features at this point:\r\n- `collate` expression -> input string is casted to `StringType(collation)`.\r\n- Collation rules are ICU collator based. Caller provides locale and strength (primary, secondary, tertiary, identical). E.g. `collate(input, 'sr-primary')` will collate input with Serbian locale that ignores both casing and accents. Secondary will ignore casing but respect accents and tertiary will respect both.\r\n- `collation` expression -> returns collation name of given input.\r\n- Support for basic operators (filters, aggregate, joins, views, inline tables etc.).\r\n- Support for `CREATE TABLE(a STRING COLLATE x)` syntax.\r\n- Basic parquet support by disabling filter pushdown.\r\n\r\nProper testing (and creating real test strategy is TBD).\r\n\r\nTBD is (proper) parquet and delta support, different collation levels (column level, table level, database level) and much more extensive testing of other features.\r\n\r\nSuggestion for reviewers of this POC is to start with `CollationSuite` and newly tests in `UTF8StringSuite` to get the gist of the changes in this PR.","created_at":"2023-12-29T12:30:07Z","updated_at":"2024-05-26T00:21:28Z","closed_at":"2024-05-26T00:21:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1a8ece6da88e3a3037f13ea07e3c2ef6fe87718f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44537/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44537/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44537/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3bc75be5b46124a9bd2c7a3c5df15fbbddade3b7","head":{"label":"dbatomic:collation_v2","ref":"collation_v2","sha":"3bc75be5b46124a9bd2c7a3c5df15fbbddade3b7","user":{"login":"dbatomic","id":150942779,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP80Ow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150942779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic","html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":722092520,"node_id":"R_kgDOKwpB6A","name":"spark","full_name":"dbatomic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbatomic","id":150942779,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP80Ow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150942779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic","html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic/spark","description":"Apache

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a sort of followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44504 but addresses a separate issue. This PR proposes to check:\r\n- if Python executable exists when looking up available Python Data Sources.\r\n- if PySpark source and Py4J files exist - for the case users don't have them in their machine (and don't use PySpark).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor some OSes such as Windows, or minimized Docker containers, there is no Python installed, and it will just fail even when users want to use Scala only. We should check the Python executable, and skip if that does not exist.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo because the main change has not been released out yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-28T03:57:38Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:47:00Z","closed_at":"2023-12-30T00:27:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ffa4f7d28a6313679aea916afb3cf2fbc4211504","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44519/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44519/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44519/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb56b579d1aa4362513bb473d9bbff90df176e11","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-46530","ref":"SPARK-46530","sha":"eb56b579d1aa4362513bb473d9bbff90df176e11","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe type of query that this PR addresses is the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(t1a))\r\nFROM t1\r\nWHERE t1d IN (SELECT t2d\r\n              FROM   t2\r\n              WHERE t1a IS NOT NULL\r\n              LIMIT 10);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, the predicate in the subquery `t1a IS NOT NULL` does not reference the inner table at all, so our standard decorrelation technique of \"compute 10 values of t2d per every value of the inner table\" does not work. In fact, such predicates can be lifted above the limit 10. This PR achieves exactly that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFixed the bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nSome broken queries are now working.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nQuery tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44368 implementing an additional type promotion to decimals with larger precision and scale.\r\nAs long as the precision increases by at least as much as the scale, the decimal values can be promoted without loss of precision: Decimal(6, 2) -> Decimal(8, 4):  1234.56 -> 1234.5600.\r\n\r\nThe non-vectorized reader (parquet-mr) is already able to do this type promotion, this PR implements it for the vectorized reader.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis allows reading multiple parquet files that contain decimal with different precision/scales\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the following now succeeds when using the vectorized Parquet reader:\r\n```\r\n  Seq(20).toDF($\"a\".cast(DecimalType(4, 2))).write.parquet(path)\r\n  spark.read.schema(\"a decimal(6, 4)\").parquet(path).collect()\r\n```\r\nIt failed before with the vectorized reader and succeeded with the non-vectorized reader.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Tests added to `ParquetWideningTypeSuite` to cover decimal promotion between decimals with different physical types: INT32, INT64, FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter the shuffle reader obtains the block, it will first perform a combine operation, and then perform a sort operation. It is known that both combine and sort may generate temporary files, so the performance may be poor when both sort and combine are used. In fact, combine operations can be performed during the sort process, and we can avoid the combine spill file.\r\nSee  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46512 for details\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nReduce the number of spills to disk when both sort and combine are used\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nspark examples run in local and yarn mode.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-27T12:44:59Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T01:40:02Z","closed_at":"2024-02-04T22:55:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4128337b1f52ffadbcd0971bcbdfcbb08917cb5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44512/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44512/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44512/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1998337a22200e6cecfb41f8e1e2c7cd05dd8378","head":{"label":"zhengchenyu:SPARK-46512","ref":"SPARK-46512","sha":"1998337a22200e6cecfb41f8e1e2c7cd05dd8378","user":{"login":"zhengchenyu","id":10381583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzgxNTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10381583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengchenyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":323537115,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM1MzcxMTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"zhengchenyu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhengchenyu","id":10381583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzgxNTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10381583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengchenyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengchenyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhengchenyu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add the support of automatic Python Data Source registration.\r\n\r\n**End user perspective:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Assume that `customsource` defined a short name as `custom` \r\npip install pyspark_customsource\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers can directly use the Python Data Source\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf = spark.format(\"custom\").load()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Developer perspective:**\r\n\r\nThe packages should follow the structure below:\r\n- The package name should start with `pyspark_` prefix\r\n- `pyspark_*.DefaultSource` has to be defined that inherits `pyspark.sql.datasource.DataSource`\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyspark_customsource\r\n├── __init__.py\r\n ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`__init__.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.datasource import DataSource\r\n\r\nclass DefaultSource(Datasource):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis allows the developers to release and maintain their 3rd party Python Data Sources separately (e.g., in PyPI), and end users can easily install the Python Data Source without doing anything other than just `pip install pyspark_their_source`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this allows users to `pip install pyspark_custom_source`, and automatically register it as Data Source available in Spark. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added.\r\n\r\nAlso manual test as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrm -fr pyspark_mysource\r\nmkdir pyspark_mysource\r\ncd pyspark_mysource\r\necho '\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.datasource import DataSource, DataSourceReader, InputPartition\r\n\r\nclass TestDataSourceReader(DataSourceReader):\r\n    def __init__(self, options):\r\n        self.options = options\r\n    def partitions(self):\r\n        return [InputPartition(i) for i in range(3)]\r\n    def read(self, partition):\r\n        yield partition.value, str(partition.value)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass DefaultSource(DataSource):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def name(cls):\r\n        return \"test\"\r\n    def schema(self):\r\n        return \"x INT, y STRING\"\r\n    def reader(self, schema) -> \"DataSourceReader\":\r\n        return TestDataSourceReader(self.options)\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def name(cls):\r\n        return \"mysource\"\r\n' > __init__.py\r\ncd ..\r\n./bin/pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.read.format(\"mysource\").load().show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  x|  y|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  0|  0|\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n|  2|  2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to do not catch DataFrame query context in DataFrame methods but leave that close to `Column` functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark DataFrame/Dataset APIs, and provide more precise context of errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, since the feature hasn't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-26T19:57:00Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T14:08:35Z","closed_at":"2024-01-11T14:08:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"49102848dce3bedf3a02133a0f0527a4efeead09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to replace `.reverse.find` with `.findLast` in Spark code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The `.findLast` seems more concise.\r\n2. The `.reverse` involves a copy of the collection, while `StringOps/ArrayOps.findLast` wraps the input data into a `ReverseIterator` to avoid collection copying.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the rst markup for a link in the documentation for `pyspark.sql.SparkSession.sql` and `pyspark.pandas.sql`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current markup is incorrect.\r\n\r\nTechnically, though the markup in this PR is correct, the link target is incorrect. We should be linking to page relative to the site root, rather than hardcoding a link to `/latest/`. However, I could not figure out how to do that in rst, and building the API docs takes a really long time, and I could not make it build incrementally.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the markup goes from looking like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/1039369/077566a3-79df-4aa2-a0f7-d819f608f673\">\r\n\r\nTo looking like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/1039369/b1453761-3f9c-435e-89e1-cfd3748cce9c\">\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI built the docs as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSKIP_SCALADOC=1 SKIP_RDOC=1 SKIP_SQLDOC=1 bundle exec jekyll serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd reviewed the output in my browser.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-26T02:36:43Z","updated_at":"2023-12-26T15:39:21Z","closed_at":"2023-12-26T05:53:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7834354be457b554f3c1003aa8e843d0a4f5ff02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds one more case to the optimization rule `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison`. The added case handles unwrapping cast in binary comparison between timestamp and timestamp_ntz types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe encountered a case that a predicate on a timestamp_ntz column is not pushed down. The query plan looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nbatch: timestamp\r\nProject [batch#26466]\r\n+- Filter (batch#26466 >= cast(2023-12-21 10:00:00 as timestamp))\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.timestamp_view\r\n      +- View (`spark_catalog`.`default`.`timestamp_view`, [batch#26466])\r\n         +- Project [cast(batch#26467 as timestamp) AS batch#26466]\r\n            +- Project [cast(batch#26463 as timestamp) AS batch#26467]\r\n               +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.table_timestamp\r\n                  +- Relation spark_catalog.default.table_timestamp[batch#26463] parquet\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [cast(batch#26463 as timestamp) AS batch#26466]\r\n+- Filter (isnotnull(batch#26463) AND (cast(batch#26463 as timestamp) >= 2023-12-21 10:00:00))\r\n   +- Relation spark_catalog.default.table_timestamp[batch#26463] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe predicate compares a timestamp_ntz column with a literal value. As the column is wrapped in a cast expression to timestamp type, the literal (string) is wrapped with a cast to timestamp type. The literal with cast is foldable so it is evaluated to literal of timestamp earlier. So the predicate becomes `cast(batch#26463 as timestamp) >= 2023-12-21 10:00:00`. As the cast is in column side, it cannot be pushed down to data source/table.\r\n\r\nWe have an optimization rule `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison` that handles similar cases but it doesn't cover timestamp types.\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, the query plan looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==                        \r\nbatch: timestamp                                     \r\nProject [batch#26446]                \r\n+- Filter (batch#26446 >= cast(2023-12-21 10:00:00 as timestamp))                                                  \r\n   +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.timestamp_view                                                           \r\n      +- View (`spark_catalog`.`default`.`timestamp_view`, [batch#26446])                                          \r\n         +- Project [cast(batch#26447 as timestamp) AS batch#26446]    \r\n            +- Project [cast(batch#26443 as timestamp) AS batch#26447]                                             \r\n               +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.table_timestamp                                              \r\n                  +- Relation spark_catalog.default.table_timestamp[batch#26443] parquet\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [cast(batch#26443 as timestamp) AS batch#26446]\r\n+- Filter (isnotnull(batch#26443) AND (batch#26443 >= 2023-12-21 10:00:00))\r\n   +- Relation spark_catalog.default.table_timestamp[batch#26443] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Casts between timestamp and timestamp_ntz in binary comparison will be unwrap if possible.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to create `SparkThrowable` sub-classes only with an error class by making the constructor with `message` private.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by unifying error exceptions: the final goal is all Spark exception should contain an error class.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo since user's code shouldn't throw `SparkThrowable` sub-classes but it can if it depends on error message formats.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test test suites like:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-22T20:16:13Z","updated_at":"2023-12-30T09:28:32Z","closed_at":"2023-12-30T09:28:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a898de8f51501522ba5a73be4b69b29f2f3926d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44464/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44464/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44464/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b18ac2e0ae074d6798323900a54c5d750345984","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:ban-messages-SparkThrowable-subclass","ref":"ban-messages-SparkThrowable-subclass","sha":"8b18ac2e0ae074d6798323900a54c5d750345984","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, make following helper functions keep the plan id in transformation:\r\n\r\n- `resolveOperatorsDownWithPruning`\r\n- `resolveOperatorsUpWithNewOutput`\r\n\r\n2, change the way to keep plan id in `ResolveNaturalAndUsingJoin`:\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nProject <- tag hiddenOutputTag\r\n  - Join <- tag PLAN_ID_TAG\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\nProject <- tag hiddenOutputTag & PLAN_ID_TAG\r\n  - Join\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n3, to verify this fix, this PR also reverts previous tags copying changes in the rules\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nwe had make following rules keep the plan id:\r\n1, `ResolveNaturalAndUsingJoin` in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/167bbca49c1c12ccd349d4330862c136b38d4522\r\n- using `resolveOperatorsUpWithPruning`, it set the tag `Project.hiddenOutputTag` internally, so `copyTagsFrom` (only works if `tags.isEmpty`) in `resolveOperatorsUpWithPruning` takes no effect\r\n\r\n2, `ExtractWindowExpressions` in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/185a0a5a23958676e4236eaf9e4d78cdfd2dd2d7\r\n- using `resolveOperatorsDownWithPruning`, which doesn't copy tags\r\n\r\n3, `WidenSetOperationTypes` in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/17c206fb71d03aefa75ecb87ca82772980dab954\r\n- using `resolveOperatorsUpWithNewOutput -> transformUpWithNewOutput`, which doesn't copy tags\r\n\r\n4, `ResolvePivot` in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/1a89bdc60d55394a1a9d94d4fa69fa5ab8041671\r\n- using `resolveOperatorsWithPruning -> resolveOperatorsDownWithPruning`, which doesn't copy tags\r\n\r\n5, `CTESubstitution` in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/79d1cded8555c5a0cc97b76747753785477eab8f\r\n- using both `resolveOperatorsDownWithPruning` and `resolveOperatorsUp -> resolveOperatorsUpWithPruning`, the former does't copy tags\r\n\r\n\r\nBut plan id missing issue still keep popping up (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44454), so this PR attempt to cover more cases by fixing the helper functions which are used to build the rules\r\n\r\n6, `ResolveUnpivot`\r\n- using `resolveOperatorsWithPruning -> resolveOperatorsDownWithPruning`, which doesn't copy tags\r\n\r\n7, `UnpivotCoercion`\r\n- using `resolveOperators -> resolveOperatorsWithPruning -> resolveOperatorsDownWithPruning`, which doesn't copy tags\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nno\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-22T11:50:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-29T01:26:02Z","closed_at":"2023-12-29T01:25:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"389fb2b216db6b93f277b7976619d448107c7157","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5088ad008c006149be948ed3b9061f42bbd23b1f","head":{"label":"zhengruifeng:sql_res_op_keep","ref":"sql_res_op_keep","sha":"5088ad008c006149be948ed3b9061f42bbd23b1f","user":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51584791,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTU4NDc5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhengruifeng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPush down part of filter which is deterministic and references are subset of aggregate's child through aggregate with nondeterministic field.\r\nFor example\r\n```\r\ntestRelation\r\n      .groupBy($\"a\")($\"a\", Rand(10).as(\"rand\"))\r\n      .where($\"a\" > 5 && $\"rand\" > 5)\r\n```\r\nWe can push down `$\"a\" > 5` and do not push down `$\"rand\" > 5`. Because `$\"rand\" > 5` is non-deterministic, push down it will change the evaluation result in `aggregate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFilter earlier to improve performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-22T09:15:55Z","updated_at":"2024-02-01T03:17:51Z","closed_at":"2024-01-31T15:18:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"185353f18c843ca485da5a8ad430c42ad8594e2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44460/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44460/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44460/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/43f1596a1690e574ef9c70ce30e3d4831cec32cd","head":{"label":"zml1206:limit_pushdown","ref":"limit_pushdown","sha":"43f1596a1690e574ef9c70ce30e3d4831cec32cd","user":{"login":"zml1206","id":5275075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzUwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5275075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206","html_url":"https://github.com/zml1206","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":500757268,"node_id":"R_kgDOHdjzFA","name":"spark","full_name":"zml1206/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zml1206","id":5275075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzUwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5275075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206","html_url":"https://github.com/zml1206","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zml1206/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zml1206/spark","description":"Apache

thanks for checking the PR. This is a small bug fix to make Scala Spark works with Clickhouse's array type. Let me know if this could cause problem on other DB types.\n\n(Please help to trigger CI if possible. I failed to make the build pipeline run - any help is appreciated)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe PR is to fix issue describe at: https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1505\r\n\r\nWhen using spark to write an array of string to Clickhouse, the Clickhouse JDBC driver throws `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown data type: string` exception.\r\n\r\nThe exception was due to Spark JDBC utils passing an invalid type value `string` (should be `String`). The original type values retrieved from Clickhouse JDBC is correct, but Spark JDBC utils attempts to convert to type string to lower case:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6b931530d75cb4f00236f9c6283de8ef450963ad/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/jdbc/JdbcUtils.scala#L639\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Remove the lowercase cast. The string value retrieved from JDBC driver implementation should be passed as-is, Spark shouldn't try to modify the value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Follow the reproduce step at: https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1505\r\n  - Create ClickHouse table with array string type\r\n  - Write scala Spark job to write to clickhouse\r\n- Verify the change fixes the issue\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-12-22T08:13:03Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T03:27:24Z","closed_at":"2024-01-17T02:58:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02dd8d8d3bd4340b21e415eb7e6948d71c3958af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e0a37f304b81b56263642c3fba7c84eabfc5eb8","head":{"label":"phanhuyn:do-not-lower-case-jdbc-array-type","ref":"do-not-lower-case-jdbc-array-type","sha":"6e0a37f304b81b56263642c3fba7c84eabfc5eb8","user":{"login":"phanhuyn","id":7282697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODI2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7282697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn","html_url":"https://github.com/phanhuyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":734635888,"node_id":"R_kgDOK8mncA","name":"spark","full_name":"phanhuyn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phanhuyn","id":7282697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODI2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7282697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn","html_url":"https://github.com/phanhuyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanhuyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phanhuyn/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `V1Writes`, we try to avoid adding Sort if the output ordering always satisfies. However, the code is completely broken with two issues:\r\n- we put `SortOrder` as the child of another `SortOrder` and compare, which always returns false.\r\n- once we add a project to do `empty2null`, we change the query output attribute id and the sort order never matches.\r\n\r\nIt's not a big issue as we still have QO rules to eliminate useless sorts, but https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44429 exposes this problem because the way we optimize sort is a bit different. For `V1Writes`, we should always avoid adding sort even if the number of ordering key is less, to not change the user query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to exclude `lib/apache-rat-*.jar` from `ScalaUnidoc / unidoc / unidocAllClasspaths` to avoid accidental contamination of the classpath when executing `sbt unidoc`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExclude unexpected dependencies from `ScalaUnidoc / unidoc / unidocAllClasspaths`:\r\n\r\n`lib/apache-rat-*.jar` is downloaded by `check-license` for license checking. It is not a direct dependency of Apache Spark, but it is accidentally added to `ScalaUnidoc / unidoc / unidocAllClasspaths` when the `sbt unidoc` command is executed.\r\n\r\nAnd the following contents have been shaded in `lib/apache-rat-*.jar`, but none of them have been relocated: \r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.commons:commons-collections4:jar:4.4\r\norg.apache.commons:commons-lang3:jar:3.12.0\r\ncommons-io:commons-io:jar:2.11.0\r\norg.apache.commons:commons-compress:jar:1.25.0\r\ncommons-cli:commons-cli:jar:1.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the aforementioned fact could lead to a build failure when executing `sbt unidoc` if Apache Spark uses a higher version of the related dependency API in the code. For instance, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44444 encountered the following error after using `JavaVersion.JAVA_21`, an enumeration value that is only supported in versions higher than commons-lang3 3.13.0:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/actions/runs/7287625573/job/19859603486\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error] /__w/spark/spark/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/Utils.scala:1777:77: value JAVA_21 is not a member of object org.apache.commons.lang3.JavaVersion\r\n[error] did you mean JAVA_11? or perhaps JAVA_10, JAVA_12, or JAVA_13? or...?\r\n[error]   val isJavaVersionAtLeast21 = SystemUtils.isJavaVersionAtLeast(JavaVersion.JAVA_21)\r\n[error]                                                                             ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since `lib/apache-rat-*.jar` is not a direct dependency of Apache Spark, it cannot be excluded through the configuration of `ExcludedDependencies`. Nor can the other dependencies shaded by `lib/apache-rat-*.jar` be version-pin through the configuration of `DependencyOverrides`. So this pr adopts the approach of excluding it from `ScalaUnidoc / unidoc / unidocAllClasspaths` to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-22T03:16:14Z","updated_at":"2023-12-23T05:47:51Z","closed_at":"2023-12-23T05:47:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b64e99469eb72c1f3f23062d8682757c9228eab5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6c84a21b97cea3deb9cc6e14efa40d935a20fe53","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-46483","ref":"SPARK-46483","sha":"6c84a21b97cea3deb9cc6e14efa40d935a20fe53","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror
