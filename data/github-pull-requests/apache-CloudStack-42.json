fixes the qemu hooks `mkdir` race condition which can happen when\r\ntoo many VMs may launch on a KVM host executing the hooks script that\r\ntries to `mkdir` for the custom directory. On exception (multiple scripts\r\ntrying to mkdir), the VM stops. When libvirtd restarts it triggers hooks, and\r\nthe issue can be reproduced, which can cause loss of running VMs. \r\n\r\nThe custom directory need not be created if it does not exist, instead\r\nthe custom hooks should only execute when there is a custom directory.\r\nAdmins who want to use the custom scripts feature can create the directory\r\nas per the feature documentation. \r\n\r\nFeature documentation:\r\nhttp://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.11.2.0/adminguide/hosts.html#kvm-libvirt-hook-script-include\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nFixed an issue, where the quick view tooltip title would not have been displayed properly on list views with a multiselect row.\r\nThis was because the html content of the first `td` of a row was used to render the title of the quick view tooltip, which would not work if the first columns content was a checkbox.\r\nNow the `td` with class `first` will be used for this (this will be the second column if there is a multiselect column, otherwise it will remain the first column).\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis PR partially fixes the logic around port forwarding rules on the Juniper SRX plugin.  The code in the plugin is based on JunOS 10, which is very old.  The changes here should not break compatibility, but should enable the plugin to be used on newer devices.  Note that an additional change to a script file is required to be able to add port forwarding rules, but as this PR was targetted for 4.11.3, I thought it best not to include this change as it might break compatibility for anyone still using JunOS 10.\r\n\r\nI've made the logic better and consistent for adding/removing static nat and port forwarding rules - these were multi-step processes which did not check each individual step.  This would aid in manually fixing rules in case of further problems.\r\n\r\nI've also improved the logging for communication with the SRX by stripping out the Apache header before sending it, and indicating the name of the template filename in use.\r\n\r\nTo be able to add port forwarding rules, the `<dst-port>` tags in dest-nat-rule-add.xml must be changed to `<low>`.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\nFixes: #3379\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nAs discussed in #3385, the translation code does not work with self closing translate tags when there is other content at the same level, e.g. `<div><translate key=\"foo\"/>: Something</div>` - it will remove the \"`: Something`\".  This PR changes the affected tags to non-self closing, e.g. `<translate key=\"foo\"></translate>: Something`\r\n\r\nThis fixes the Zone names not being displayed on the capacity graphs on the dashboard, plus some minor missing labels elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\nFixes: #3385 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nFixes #3191 \r\n\r\nWhen a template is registered, code stores md5sum of the downloaded file in the `vm_template` table. However, this downloaded file could be deleted after template installation if it is not an actual (`.qcow2`, `.ova`, etc.) file. When the user copies a template using copyTemplate API, the actual template file will be copied across the image stores. Matching checksum for the copied templated file and the stored value from the `vm_template` table will result in a mismatch.\r\nChanges will set an empty checksum value for the copied template while passing to download service which allows skipping wrong checksum check for the copied while install.\r\nHowever, this results in a change in checksum value for concerned template entry in `vm_template` table post template install.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nFixes #3295 \r\n\r\nlistPublicIPAddresses API was missing **networkid** parameter and it has been used in UI to list public IP addresses while changing IP address for a VM.\r\n\r\n_networkid_ parameter is added to listPublicIPAddresses API which would allow filtering public IP addresses based on the source network. This will help to show relevant IP addresses when users try to change assigned IP address for a VM NIC.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThe VR code has provision for inserting rules at the top or bottom by specifying \"front\" as the second parameter to `self.fw.append`.  However, there are a number of cases where someone has been unaware of this and added a rule with the pattern `self.fw.append([\"mangle\", \"\", \"-I PREROUTING\"...`.  This causes the code to check for the rule already being present to fail, and duplicate rules end up being added.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two of these cases which apply to adding static NAT rules.  I am aware of more of these cases, but I don't have the ability to easily test the outcome of fixing them.  I'm happy to add these in if you're confident that the automated tests will be sufficient.  Searching for \"-I (case sensitive) finds these.\r\n\r\nThe [code for dealing with \"front\"](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/systemvm/debian/opt/cloud/bin/cs/CsNetfilter.py#L166) is included below to show that this shouldn't have any ill effects:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nif fw[1] == \"front\":\r\n    cpy = cpy.replace('-A', '-I')\r\n~~~\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\nFixes: #3177 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThis feature allows administrators to perform live migrations on DPDK enabled VMs between DPDK enabled hosts in the same cluster.\r\n\r\nA DPDK enabled host must be configured to enable the CloudStack DPDK support. Properties on agent.properties must be populated as:\r\n- openvswitch.dpdk.enabled=true\r\n- openvswitch.dpdk.ovs.path=<OVS_PATH>\r\n- network.bridge.type=openvswitch\r\n- libvirt.vif.driver=com.cloud.hypervisor.kvm.resource.OvsVifDriver\r\n\r\nEach time a CloudStack agent on a KVM host starts a connection to its management server, it sends a comma-separated list of capabilities available on the host, such as: 'hvm', 'snapshot'. The management server persists the information received from the agent on database ('capabilities' column on 'hosts' table)\r\n\r\n- When the property 'openvswitch.dpdk.enabled' = true, the 'dpdk' capability is included in the list of capabilities sent to the management server.\r\n\r\n- When the property 'openvswitch.dpdk.enabled' = false, the list of capabilities sent to the management server does not inclide the 'dpdk' capability.\r\n\r\nPlease note that agent restart is required after any property from agent.properties file is changed. Also having the dpdk capability, the hosts will be able and will host VMs without the dpdk configuration. In this case, openvswitch ports without DPDK support are created, just like for system VMs.\r\n\r\nThe management server is enhanced to determinate if a VM is a DPDK enabled VM when:\r\n- The VM type is 'User'\r\n- The VM details or service offering details contain additional configurations with the name:\r\n   - 'dpdk-hugepages'\r\n   - 'dpdk-numa'\r\n- The KVM host on which the VM is running contains the 'dpdk' capability.\r\n\r\n### API changes\r\n\r\nThe 'findSuitableHostsForMigration' API is enhanced to support DPDK enabled VMs.\r\n- When the VM is a DPDK enabled VM then only DPDK enabled hosts must be suitable for migration. Suitable hosts must be only the ones with the 'dpdk' capability as part of its capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe 'migrateVirtualMachine' API method is extended to support DPDK enabled VMs live migrations:\r\n- When the VM to live migrate is not a DPDK enabled VM, the logic remains unchanged.\r\n- When the VM to live migrate is a DPDK enabled VM, it can be live migrated between two hosts when:\r\n   - The KVM source host is a DPDK enabled host (the 'dpdk' capability is part of its capabilities)\r\n   - The KVM destination host is a DPDK enabled host on the same cluster as the source host\r\n   - If the destination host is not a DPDK enabled host, then the migration must fail with a descriptive message.\r\n   - Before attempting the live migration, the destination host must be prepared for the migration:\r\n      - A new DPDK port must be created for each interface of the VM\r\n   - Before attempting the live migration, the source host must:\r\n      - Obtain the VM XML domain as a copy of the current XML domain\r\n      - Replace the XML parts, referencing the new DPDK ports on the destination host for each interface\r\n   - After the migration is successful, the VM interface DPDK ports on the source host must be removed.\r\n   - In case of migration failure, the DPDK ports created on the destination hosts are cleaned up.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis PR resolves 2 issues related to Virtual Routers with multiple public interfaces, and works around a third.\r\n\r\n1. Fixes: #3353 - Adds missing throw routes for eth0/eth1 to eth3+ when there are >1 public IPs \r\n2. Fixes: #3168 - Incorrect marks set on some static NAT rules (some code references were changed from `hex(int(interfacenum))` to `hex(100 + int(interfacenum))` - this change just adds the remaining ones\r\n3. Works around #3352 - Sends Gratuitous ARP messages when a HA VR becomes master to work around the problem of the MAC address being different between HA VRs.  If that issue is fixed properly (i.e. a database entry for the subsequent interfaces so they can be static) then this is unnecessary, though should not cause any problems.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nSince the CloudStack virtual router was redesigned on version 4.6 it has been observed that the DHCP leases file is not persistent across network operations. This causes conflicts on guest VMs static IPs, causing these static IPs to not be renewed by the DHCP server running on isolated and VPC networks' virtual routers (dnsmasq). On stopping or destroying a VM, its dhcp/dns records are not removed from the virtual router causing ghost effects.\r\n\r\nFixes #3272 \r\nFixes #3354 \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested on local environment, 1x KVM host, Isolated network\r\n- Create VMs on isolated network\r\n- Restart

Description\r\n\r\nThis implements a new feature to get logs and diagnostics data from systemvms (CPVM, SSVM) and virtual routers as a downloadable zip file from the secondary storage. The diagnostics zip files live in the `diagnostics` directory of the secondary storage. The feature is only supported for NFS based secondary storage and root admins.\r\n\r\nFS: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/CloudStack+Get+Diagnostics+Data+API\r\n\r\nThe feature adds the following global settings:\r\n```\r\ndiagnostics.data.gc.enable\r\ndiagnostics.data.gc.interval\r\ndiagnostics.data.retrieval.timeout\r\ndiagnostics.data.max.file.age\r\ndiagnostics.data.disable.threshold\r\ndiagnostics.data.systemvm.defaults\r\ndiagnostics.data.router.defaults\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the UI, the root admin can now see a download button to get the diagnostics data from CPVM, SSVM and VRs.\r\n\r\nFixes: #3593\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

first startup, the management server creates and saves a random\r\nssh keypair using `ssh-keygen` in the database. The command does\r\nnot specify keys in PEM format which is not the default as generated\r\nby latest ssh-keygen tool.\r\n\r\nThe systemvmtemplate always needs re-building whenever there is a change\r\nin the cloud-early-config file. This also tries to fix that by introducing a\r\n`stage 2` bootstrap.sh where the changes specific to hypervisor detection\r\netc are refactored/moved. The initial cloud-early-config only patches\r\nbefore the other scripts are called.\r\n\r\nAdditional commentary:\r\nOn latest CentOS7 release (CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)) I hit a\r\nbug where router_proxy (ssh) failed due to public key issue and kept\r\nprompting for a passphrase (the default is blank/empty). By adding a\r\nnewline to the id_rsa.cloud private key it did not prompt the same and\r\nssh worked. By performing a visual diff on bytes of the file I found\r\nthat the DB version of the keypair and the version that gets put on the\r\nKVM host had a missing `line feed (0xA0)` character. This patch fixes\r\nthe issue by ensuring we save the ssh keypair in the database exactly\r\nas it is generated by ssh-keygen. Furthermore, I found that sometimes\r\nthe VR startup could fail if the VR took more time to patch, so I\r\nincreased the number of retries it previously used to do.\r\n\r\nScreenshot showing the binary difference between ssh private key files (as on management server vs on the kvm host):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-17 13-43-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95203/57915498-8c992480-78ae-11e9-9b7b-feb45cec284f.png)\r\n\r\nAfter the fix the checksums match on both the kvm host and on the management server:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-17 13-59-30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95203/57915527-9f135e00-78ae-11e9-8059-067034c2edb6.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-05-17 13-59-41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95203/57915552-ac304d00-78ae-11e9-86cd-981bd17dd1b0.png)\r\n\r\nSSH packages details on my CentOS7 env:\r\nlibssh2.x86_64                             1.4.3-12.el7_6.2            @updates\r\nopenssh.x86_64                             7.4p1-16.el7                @anaconda\r\nopenssh-askpass.x86_64                     7.4p1-16.el7                @base\r\nopenssh-clients.x86_64                     7.4p1-16.el7                @anaconda\r\nopenssh-server.x86_64                      7.4p1-16.el7                @anaconda\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThis PR is an SCSS-refactoring addition to PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3307#issuecomment-491314203\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis enhances code-quality of scss code by\r\n- including tool-tasks like sass-lint-fix (autodetects scss lint warnings and fix them if possible)\r\n- adding jsbeautifyrc, that can be used by IDE extensions to unify scss code automatically \r\n- deleting old css files for IE7, that will no longer be in use today (almost 13 years old browser)\r\n- rethinking of old \"custom.css\"-style-file. (it's not beneficial to generate own custom css file anymore. The less css, the less server requests. Rather now any CSS code can be included inside custom.scss file and will be compiled at bottom of cloudstack3.css by compiler.\r\n- adding z-index variables to better organize treacherous interdependently z-index values.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nBy running compilers and check build css code and by visiting the page with new css file.\r\n(This changes modify and unify the structure of css code only and deleting old unused code)\r\nAll we have to check yet, is if cloudstack3.css includes any effective changes.\r\n\r\nIt's very useful to reduce the diff to non whitespace changes here again:\r\n![Screenshot 2019-04-26 at 16 23

Description\r\nThis change addresses #3089. There was an issue when disks were being added with bus type IDE when creating windows VMs from ISOs. It is not possible to select bus type when creating a VM with an ISO. The bus type is inferred based on the platform emulator string provided to the KVM agent. Currently when creating a VM with managed storage (ex: Solidfire) and OS type string Windows*, all disks are added as IDE. Qemu currently does not support multiple IDE controllers and this configuration results in VMs that cannot be started. This issue does not occur when using NFS as the storage provider due to logic in that KVM agent that makes all data volumes (non root) use a virtio controller for file based disk. Similar logic was added for raw physical disks so that managed storage has the same behavior as NFS. In addition specific versions were removed from the code that guesses the disk controller to be used based on the platform emulator string since most modern operating systems support virtio.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\nsteps to reproduce are described in #3089\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n**Problem**\r\nAt the moment ACLs attached to a private gateway are not working. The rules are created on the virtual router but multiple small errors prevent their evaluation.\r\n\r\n**Fix # 1**\r\nThis commit changes the ordering of rules in the FORWARD table so the custom chains created are evaluated.\r\n\r\n**Fix # 2**\r\nAlso ACLs on private gateways should not only be valid for the VPC CIDR but also for networks that are reached via static routes. This is achieved by considering all traffic that goes through the relevant network interface.\r\n\r\n**Fix # 3**\r\nThis commit sets the right interface for the ACL_INBOUND_ethX chains. Before the interface was set on \"out\" even though the rules states it's inbound. **TODO push commit**\r\n( self.fw.append([\"filter\", \"\", \"-A FORWARD -i %s -j ACL_INBOUND_%s\" % (self.dev, self.dev)]) )\r\n-> CsAddress.py:444\r\n\r\n**Fix # 4**\r\nACL_OUTBOUND rules should also be filtered -> Move them to filter\r\n\r\n**Fix # 5**\r\nTo allow for correct private gateway ACL evaluation the argument already generated by the java code needed to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nBefore this change, when creating a HA network in the Simulator, both Routers would be in BACKUP mode.  Many years ago in f0c3b4c62a7a1a440d723696d61b42dad58f6faf, logic was added to allow the line \"router_pr=100\" to be added to the bootargs field of mockvm in the Simulator database to allow a VR to become MASTER.  This doesn't work automatically (nowhere sets it) and actually fails because the field is too short, and no other statuses can be simulated.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, Redundant State now comes from the \"redundate_state=MASTER\" part in bootargs, which is already populated.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Start/Reboot/Stop VM code of the simulator now incldues logic to change the redundant state:\r\n  * When Starting a VR, if no other VRs are Running and MASTER on this network, become MASTER\r\n  * When Stopping a VR, if we are MASTER become BACKUP.  If another VR is running and BACKUP, make it MASTER.\r\n  * When Rebooting a VR, combine this logic (Stop/Start)\r\n\r\nThis will allow integration tests to easily change the state of a VR.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the simulator will change the redundant state of a VR when it is started or stopped.  When a VR is started, if there are no other running VRs that are MASTER then \r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n_Copy of https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3301 because I run into troubles after changing my username_\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis adds an gulp tasks, to build existing css files out of scss files and enables advantages for working with style rules. \r\nAlso this will reduce the complexibility of heavy css files **in all future css changes**.\r\n\r\n- Using CSS is no longer the common standard for complex pages like cloudstack\r\n- SASS (https://sass-lang.com/) or SCSS are preprocessors of CSS. Similar to ES6 or TypeScript for JavaScript.\r\n- SCSS files are compiled to CSS files ones while development or deployment, and not on every page request\r\n- SCSS provides us many logical functions and advantages to organise CSS rules more easily and less redundand with features like variables and so called mixins\r\n- SCSS let us work more modular and is better maintainable\r\n- We could split CSS files too, but this is not best practice, since many CSS files will result in many server requests and with SCSS it's possible to compile many files into one single CSS file (full automatically in just under a second after any SCSS changes)\r\n- This compiled CSS file could also get minified, which will enhance loading times of cloudstack pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n(This changes modify and unify the structure of css code only.)\r\nAll we have to check yet, is if .css file-changes include only: indentation, spaces and quotes.\r\n\r\nIt's very useful to reduce the diff to non whitespace changes here:\r\n![Screenshot 2019-04-26 at 16

Description\r\n\r\nThis feature provides novnc console for virtual machines.\r\n\r\nIt is developed based on\r\n(1) noVNC 1.1.0\r\n(2) latest websockify\r\nSome  changes in cloudstack\r\n(1) add a new servlet /novncconsole\r\n(2) a websocket proxy based on websockify will be launched in CPVM.\r\n(3) add vnc password authentication in websockify\r\n(4) generate 'path' and decrypt it in websockify to connect to server/port and check vnc password.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n(1) it works with ubuntu 16.04/qemu 2.5 \r\n(2) If consoleproxy.sslEnabled is changed, please restart management server and CPVM (or cloud service in CPVM). It determines http or https will be used in novnc console\r\n(3) If novnc.console.default is true,novnc console will be default console on UI. If it is false, we still can access novnc console via /novncconsole?cmd=access&vm=XXX\r\n(4) global setting novnc.encryption.key is hidden, it can be changed via cloudmonkey. Restart CPVM (or cloud service in CPVM) if it is changed.\r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n\r\n- [ ] Test on KVM (CentOS + Ubuntu)\r\n- [ ] Test on VMware\r\n- [ ] Test on XenServer and XCP-NG\r\n- [ ] Fix license

Description\r\n\r\nThis feature provides novnc console for virtual machines.\r\n\r\nIt is developed based on\r\n(1) noVNC 1.1.0\r\n(2) latest websockify\r\nSome  changes in cloudstack\r\n(1) add a new servlet /novncconsole\r\n(2) a websocket proxy based on websockify will be launched in CPVM.\r\n(3) add vnc password authentication in websockify\r\n(4) generate 'path' and decrypt it in websockify to connect to server/port and check vnc password.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n(1) it works with ubuntu 16.04/qemu 2.5 \r\n(2) If consoleproxy.sslEnabled is changed, please restart management server and CPVM (or cloud service in CPVM). It determines http or https will be used in novnc console\r\n(3) If novnc.console.default is true,novnc console will be default console on UI. If it is false, we still can access novnc console via /novncconsole?cmd=access&vm=XXX\r\n(4) global setting novnc.encryption.key is hidden, it can be changed via cloudmonkey. Restart CPVM (or cloud service in CPVM) if it is changed.\r\n\r\n## What need to do ？\r\n(1) Test on other environment / hypervisor\r\n(2) Add License\r\n(3) Encrypt vm vnc information using rijndael/CBC instead of rijndael/ECB.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

Description\r\nSlow VM creation times are experienced when using solid fire managed storage. It is suspected that this is caused by calls to getUsedBytes in the solid fire storage driver. Storage used by snapshots is not being computed efficiently resulting in a large number of DB queries.\r\n\r\ngetUsedBytes is called a number of times during the vm creation process. This PR proposes to refactor it so that a constant number of queries are used to compute it. We do one query each to the volumes table, the snapshot_store_ref table and the template_spool_ref table instead of querying the respective *_details tables by object id to get the size of each type of object.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nAttempt to create a VM in a Cloudstack instance that has a large number of snapshots\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nVM creation should happen in a less than a few minutes\r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\nVM creation takes around 5 minutes even with small images\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Vm creation time was significantly improved since counts are being done in memory after getting all volumes, snapshots and templates in single queries.\r\n\r\n## Further work\r\nVM creation is still not as fast as with NFS when creating VMs from ISO templates. Further investigation is needed but this is out side the scope of this PR.\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nThis commit simplifies the `generateDestPath` method and fixes an issue where an extra file, named as '_null_', was created on the target storage pool during VM local storage volume migration. Without this fix, the VM is migrated and there is no data loss; however, 193 KB is allocated for the unused file named as '_null_' and the file stays on the target storage.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nSlow VM creation times are experienced when using solid fire managed storage. It is suspected that this is caused by calls to getUsedBytes in the solid fire storage driver that result in calls to the solid fire appliance when volume details are not available in the database. Volume details should be available in the database for volumes in ready state. We expect the error to be resolved by only attempting to get bytes used by active volumes by skipping volumes that are not in ready state.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n1. Create a large number of volumes in the database that are not in ready state.\r\n2. Attempt to create a VM\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nVM creation should happen in a less than a few minutes\r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\nVM creation takes around 5 minutes even with small images\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

this patch https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/commit/b766bf7fc9787b2516eee2eac6f00dd03a327b8b\r\nwe started tracking disks in attaching state so that other attach request can fail gracefully. However this missed the case where disks were in allocated state but attach was requested.\r\n\r\nFor the use case where users want to attach disk in allocated state but not ready, we need to have allocated-attaching transition as well. We must take care of returning to the original state - allocated or ready - when attach request has completed. \r\n\r\nFor the use case of unstarted vm's the disk must proceed as follows - \"Allocated\" -> Attaching -> Allocated. When VM is started, the disk is \"created\" and pool is assigned. For the use case of started VMs it's more trivial and disk proceeds as follows - Ready -> Attaching -> Ready. \r\n\r\nTest this by creating a VM with \"startvm=false\", create a disk and try attaching it in allocated state. It would give an exception on latest 4.11 but will be fixed on this patch.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nProblem: In Vmware, appliances that have options that are required to be answered before deployments are configurable through vSphere vCenter user interface but it is not possible from the CloudStack user interface.\r\n\r\nRoot cause: CloudStack does not handle vApp configuration options during deployments if the appliance contains configurable options. These configurations are mandatory for VM deployment from the appliance on Vmware vSphere vCenter. As shown in the image below, Vmware detects there are mandatory configurations that the administrator must set before deploy the VM from the appliance (in red on the image below):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/56087742-61528e00-5e47-11e9-88e9-6a6f2955a9d9.png)\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- On template registration, after it is downloaded to secondary storage, the OVF file is examined and OVF properties are extracted from the file when available.\r\n- OVF properties extracted from templates after being downloaded to secondary storage are stored on the new table 'template_ovf_properties'.\r\n- A new optional section is added to the VM deployment wizard in the UI:\r\n   - If the selected template does not contain OVF properties, then the optional section is not displayed on the wizard.\r\n   - If the selected template contains OVF properties, then the optional new section is displayed. Each OVF property is displayed and the user must complete every property before proceeding to the next section.\r\n      - If any configuration property is empty, then a dialog is displayed indicating that there are empty properties which must be set before proceeding\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/56087758-bee6da80-5e47-11e9-9f4c-63d00aed8de5.png)\r\n- The specific OVF properties set on deployment are stored on the 'user_vm_details' table with the prefix: 'ovfproperties-'.\r\n- The VM is configured with the vApp configuration section containing the values that the user provided on the wizard.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/56087763-ca3a0600-5e47-11e9-8196-df9494ee9424.png)\r\n\r\nA new tab is displayed when a template contains OVF properties, displaying each properties' label, description and

The VM metrics has aggregated volume bytes read/write and iops metrics but not on per volume basis.\r\n*Root Cause*: The volume stats sub-system is not used to export the metrics, the support is not

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWe want to support hiding selective columns in metrics tables for \"users\" through a config file so that admins can make the relevant information hidden as per their organization needs. \r\n\r\nCurrent PR code will supports metrics tables but can be extended to any table with minimal work in future. Config file will take the key of the metrics column from metrics.js file for the sake of minimal changes and simplicity of development along with future extension.\r\n\r\n(#3217 was merged with this PR)\r\n**Problem**: The keyboard list in the UI is not consistent across views such as in the instance wizard and in the register template form. There is also no way to customize about url/text and doc title and help URL in the UI.\r\n**Root Cause**: The list is hardcoded in the UI allowing no centralised configuration.\r\n**Solution**: Introduce a new `config.js` file installed at the `/usr/share/cloudstackmanagement/webapp/config.js` location. The config.js allows configurable keyboard list, about url/text, doc title,  and help URL. It will also allow defining which columns need to be hidden.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n**Problem:** Users can register ISOs from URL but cannot upload local ISOs.\r\n\r\n**Root cause:** CloudStack provides browser-based upload support for volumes and templates, but ISOs are not supported.\r\n\r\n**Solution:** \r\nThe existing browser-based upload from local functionality for templates and volumes (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=39620237) is extended to support uploading local ISOs. \r\n- Extend the UI: A new button is created under the ISOs view: 'Upload from Local'. A new dialog form is displayed in which the user must select the ISO to upload from its local file system.\r\n- Extend the API: New 'GetUploadParamsForIso' API command is created to handle the ISO upload.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

Description\r\n**Problem**: Compute or service offerings cannot be linked to specified multiple domain(s) and zone(s).\r\n**Root cause**: Compute offerings are independent of zones and they can be linked only to a single domain/sub-domain\r\n**Solution**: Compute or service offerings will be allowed to link with specified domain(s) and zone(s). Disk offering linked with multiple domains and zones can be created both with UI and API. Refactored createServiceOffering  API to allow passing list of domain and zone IDs with domainids and zoneids parameter respectively. UI has been refactored to allow selecting multiple domains and zones while creating compute offering using multi-select elements. When list of passed domains contain both parent and child domain offering will be created for parent domain. Compute offering details will now show list of linked domains and zones as a comma-separated list of names. Linked domains and zones will be stored in the cloud.service_offering_details table in database as comma-separated list of IDs with key domainids and zoneids respectively.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
