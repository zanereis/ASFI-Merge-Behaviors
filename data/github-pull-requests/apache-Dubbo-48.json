What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6887\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThere are many threads named with Dubbo-thread-xxx on the consumer side，these threads will not be recycled.\r\n(中文：消费方出现了很多以Dubbo-thread-xxx命名的线程，这些线程不会被回收)\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n消费方感知到提供方下线或者禁用\r\n\r\nAllChannelHandler#disconnected -> getExecutorService() -> getSharedExecutorService()\r\n-> DefaultExecutorRepository#getExecutor -> 此时消费方关联线程池已关闭(executor.isShutdown() || executor.isTerminated()) -> createExecutor(url)\r\n\r\n上面的URL并不存在threadname、threadpool参数，导致消费方创建了FixedThreadPool线程池\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-08T09:53:04Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:42:16Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:42:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a9ac1fbc91cb4d725a95df6beda30819eeb54f92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n\r\n issue: https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6854\r\n\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

to overload In Wrapper class\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-03T09:19:57Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T03:23:38Z","closed_at":"2020-11-06T03:23:26Z","merged_at":"2020-11-06T03:23:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b0dc355798608ae6790a535ad7963b95eff8581","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6870/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6870/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6870/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c29fde2a14a910f4c7adde1d6201c9e7ac555766","head":{"label":"LeeGuoPing:dubbo-lgp-overload","ref":"dubbo-lgp-overload","sha":"c29fde2a14a910f4c7adde1d6201c9e7ac555766","user":{"login":"LeeGuoPing","id":35389145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mzg5MTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35389145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing","html_url":"https://github.com/LeeGuoPing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305582559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU1ODI1NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"LeeGuoPing/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LeeGuoPing","id":35389145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mzg5MTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35389145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing","html_url":"https://github.com/LeeGuoPing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeeGuoPing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LeeGuoPing/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1. Clean code.\r\n2. Improve performence.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRemove the useless variable `success` and the associated unreachable branche.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nBuild and Tested\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-29T06:04:50Z","updated_at":"2024-09-20T09:18:01Z","closed_at":"2021-03-14T08:29:46Z","merged_at":"2021-03-14T08:29:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"a02bd5d5ef2d8f0b6d9105d80be27df9a5ce642b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kimmking","id":807508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking","html_url":"https://github.com/kimmking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimmking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7331964,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzMxOTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Bugs

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-28T11:41:14Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T09:13:51Z","closed_at":"2021-05-18T09:13:51Z","merged_at":"2021-05-18T09:13:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"3531a7d681da5574f31609beeb2ed288af7aaebc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6844/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6844/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6844/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/79a9131fea17d77f312cb5b34d1d74cf7b16022e","head":{"label":"panxiaojun233:feature/state-router","ref":"feature/state-router","sha":"79a9131fea17d77f312cb5b34d1d74cf7b16022e","user":{"login":"panxiaojun233","id":43985911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTg1OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43985911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233","html_url":"https://github.com/panxiaojun233","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":292961759,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTI5NjE3NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"panxiaojun233/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panxiaojun233","id":43985911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTg1OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43985911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233","html_url":"https://github.com/panxiaojun233","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panxiaojun233/dubbo","description":"Apache

the README.md file.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nFixed typo, grammatical, punctuations, and semantic coherence.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nDoesn't impact the main codebase, and is entirely limited to the README.md file.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

the CONTRIBUTING.md file.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nFixed typo, grammatical, punctuations, and semantic coherence.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nDoesn't impact the main codebase, and is entirely limited to the CONTRIBUTING.md file.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-12T12:40:21Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T03:06:56Z","closed_at":"2020-10-13T03:06:55Z","merged_at":"2020-10-13T03:06:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"f9f10ba5225e80c34953f56123ac1702c13e45c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5e1050f309480a63c088b8590ed4142cfc151381","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:consumer-token-print","ref":"consumer-token-print","sha":"5e1050f309480a63c088b8590ed4142cfc151381","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168960913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5NjA5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"manzhizhen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-09T01:09:06Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T09:58:52Z","closed_at":"2021-04-11T09:58:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7ef8ec85b25baa25cf8af384e5ce1265ef065ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-30T04:56:10Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T03:20:35Z","closed_at":"2020-10-13T03:20:35Z","merged_at":"2020-10-13T03:20:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"8d06e5e91604d3cfbd721d1f7b414fa53f0f2eb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7bf879ece319f351a25d65d68063e9790a0140ce","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:fix-dubboprotocol-getshareclient-npe","ref":"fix-dubboprotocol-getshareclient-npe","sha":"7bf879ece319f351a25d65d68063e9790a0140ce","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168960913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5NjA5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"manzhizhen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-28T06:32:05Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T06:07:41Z","closed_at":"2020-10-10T06:07:41Z","merged_at":"2020-10-10T06:07:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"099fc5d823419548db135f1a5274ae53bf58a0d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6786/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6786/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6786/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fd58cde7ace6e359628fd5c2065f11579624e83c","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:threadpool_add_alive","ref":"threadpool_add_alive","sha":"fd58cde7ace6e359628fd5c2065f11579624e83c","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168960913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5NjA5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"manzhizhen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-18T05:44:06Z","updated_at":"2022-05-20T06:11:13Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T08:56:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91947e0c142f734e0db48f0912f88ba901b0acbf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6766/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6766/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6766/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ac944044b3658e4d34c2d42efaa643a2fbf43c44","head":{"label":"owen200008:fix_lazyconnect_reuse","ref":"fix_lazyconnect_reuse","sha":"ac944044b3658e4d34c2d42efaa643a2fbf43c44","user":{"login":"owen200008","id":7434837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzQ4Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7434837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008","html_url":"https://github.com/owen200008","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":283376913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODMzNzY5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"owen200008/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"owen200008","id":7434837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzQ4Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7434837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008","html_url":"https://github.com/owen200008","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/owen200008/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [#6749](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6749) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2020-09-17T06:28:46Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T08:56:18Z","closed_at":"2021-03-14T08:56:18Z","merged_at":"2021-03-14T08:56:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"97cb4352b26377735ca6cf9b690d2f09522bba20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6760/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6760/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6760/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/35ddea6d6aadaaba83f9cf3c9f91d93bee9cb0b5","head":{"label":"gzldc:master","ref":"master","sha":"35ddea6d6aadaaba83f9cf3c9f91d93bee9cb0b5","user":{"login":"gzldc","id":42136163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTM2MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42136163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc","html_url":"https://github.com/gzldc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":296235915,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTYyMzU5MTU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"gzldc/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gzldc","id":42136163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTM2MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42136163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc","html_url":"https://github.com/gzldc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzldc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gzldc/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-16T12:58:02Z","updated_at":"2020-09-16T12:58:12Z","closed_at":"2020-09-16T12:58:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6752/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6752/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6752/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/be75b2a199a2f1fb95156672219dab52b8774b69","head":{"label":"quhongwei:icbc-metadata","ref":"icbc-metadata","sha":"be75b2a199a2f1fb95156672219dab52b8774b69","user":{"login":"quhongwei","id":3232378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzIzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3232378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei","html_url":"https://github.com/quhongwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":284863201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODQ4NjMyMDE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"quhongwei/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"quhongwei","id":3232378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzIzNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3232378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei","html_url":"https://github.com/quhongwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quhongwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/quhongwei/dubbo","description":"Apache

classes: \r\n1. org.apache.dubbo.registry.client.RegistryProtocol\r\n2. org.apache.dubbo.registry.integration.InterfaceCompatibleRegistryProtocol\r\n\r\nOriginal code:\r\n`URL urlToRegistry = new URL(CONSUMER_PROTOCOL, parameters.remove(REGISTER_IP_KEY), 0, type.getName(), parameters);`\r\nCONSUMER_PROTOCOL is `consumer`\r\n\r\nAfter modified code:\r\n`URL urlToRegistry = new URL(DEFAULT_REGISTRY, parameters.remove(REGISTER_IP_KEY), 0, type.getName(), parameters);`\r\nDEFAULT_REGISTRY is `dubbo`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-16T10:16:56Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T02:10:08Z","closed_at":"2021-03-02T02:10:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ca813dacd13dc09494ba0bd80ec99e619aab277","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-16T06:45:30Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T05:40:01Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T09:28:26Z","merged_at":"2021-03-04T09:28:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"eef6b450fc69f6670d19c050719a6766343a1729","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-11T22:53:09Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T06:50:49Z","closed_at":"2020-10-30T06:50:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6727/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6727/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6727/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/98b01f36fe15434a49e2459b44eb4012858c4faf","head":{"label":"yxhsmart:master","ref":"master","sha":"98b01f36fe15434a49e2459b44eb4012858c4faf","user":{"login":"yxhsmart","id":23137812,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTM3ODEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23137812?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart","html_url":"https://github.com/yxhsmart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yxhsmart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.7.x","ref":"2.7.x","sha":"4aaaea43ae75bee99837183c5be37ca2cb942741","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-10T06:32:50Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T05:33:13Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T09:41:01Z","merged_at":"2021-06-15T09:41:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"222bf15bd55050ba9f6490ef5ea066f8f6c2bcf8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

parameter\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-07T03:19:55Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T12:41:45Z","closed_at":"2021-02-25T12:41:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ff36316f70bce3b2dae2713970a951c0343a1c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8bfaa13af68fc2e4b8c0c6415353a34641639369","head":{"label":"likemoongg:fix_url_default_version","ref":"fix_url_default_version","sha":"8bfaa13af68fc2e4b8c0c6415353a34641639369","user":{"login":"likemoongg","id":22185346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTg1MzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22185346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg","html_url":"https://github.com/likemoongg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likemoongg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ae514c0f8a726268b9a42fe1903e1f59d6d24c3f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd a ConsumerInterceptor to setting consumer zone \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-02T01:16:07Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:44:04Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:44:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b68d44b471a0e01355e3c4dd0bdc69980839b0ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-30T15:28:51Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T05:11:51Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T05:11:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"793b013ec86b869c5e8cfee196f897af287615ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6662/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6662/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6662/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c7c0c45f1fd847522cc305b9e25f0d0f370c6f39","head":{"label":"liuyuhang-cn:2.7.x","ref":"2.7.x","sha":"c7c0c45f1fd847522cc305b9e25f0d0f370c6f39","user":{"login":"liuyuhang-cn","id":19968234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTY4MjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19968234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyuhang-cn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyuhang-cn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.7.x","ref":"2.7.x","sha":"4aaaea43ae75bee99837183c5be37ca2cb942741","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-29T15:55:10Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T16:35:29Z","closed_at":"2021-06-10T16:35:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"981d365128887bde129e479dce766e76261c50c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/20/labels","id":3507969,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzUwNzk2OQ==","number":20,"title":"3.0.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1,"closed_issues":19,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-19T02:18:35Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T13:20:45Z","due_on":"2021-07-10T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-08-06T07:53:19Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6660/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6660/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6660/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4aeefab2c2aa3aa29828202262b92c70df6c43d5","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:redis-config-center","ref":"redis-config-center","sha":"4aeefab2c2aa3aa29828202262b92c70df6c43d5","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-29T11:26:21Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T13:16:43Z","closed_at":"2021-02-25T13:16:42Z","merged_at":"2021-02-25T13:16:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"530bc171eaa0a1ce1be3a8597ecc7502e3d00787","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6659/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6659/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6659/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c9d97385abb47d856b8ab859b81a715216227b60","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:hashmap_size","ref":"hashmap_size","sha":"c9d97385abb47d856b8ab859b81a715216227b60","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache
