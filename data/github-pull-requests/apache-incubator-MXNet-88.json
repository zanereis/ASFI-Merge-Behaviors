PR merges WarpCTC (https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc) into MXNet, so that MXNet has a native CTC loss layer. Some questions/issues:\r\n\r\n- This currently depends on ModernGPU, which is a header only GPU library. This dependency should eventually be removed in favor of CUB. \r\n- Lint: I haven't conformed ModernGPU and WarpCTC to MXNet code style. Should this be done, or is there a way to set the linter to ignore these folders?\r\n- I don't have any license info in the WarpCTC files. What should I put?\r\n- I have already removed dependency on some custom reduction routines, and am using MShadow instead. So the GPU timings might be a bit different from WarpCTC.\r\n\r\nSome design issues:\r\n- This layer uses the following sizes for inputs and outputs: data has dims `(sequence_length, batch_size, alphabet_size + 1)`, labels has dims `(batch_size, label_sequence_length)`, and output `(batch_size)`. The output is a loss for every element in the batch.\r\n- The implementation supports variable length label sequences via 0-padding. A separate PR will implement variable-length sequence support for the data input.\r\n\r\n@piiswrong
