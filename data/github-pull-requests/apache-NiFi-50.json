you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nProvides an alternative to JoltTransformJSON using [JSLT](https://github.com/schibsted/jslt) as the transformation language. The JOLT DSL can have a steep learning curve, where JSLT is inspired by other popular tools such as `jq`, `XPath` and `XQuery`. The resulting NAR is < 2MB and only has Jackson as a dependency so I included it in the assembly.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Services links to proper Controller Settings tab\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\nThe link to a Reporting Task Referencing Component incorrectly navigated to the Registry Clients tab of the Controller Settings. Now, it properly links to the Reporting Tasks tab, and also highlights the Reporting Task in question. While no unit tests were added for this update, it was verified in the UI of a running NiFi instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8186 Updates the `spring-security-saml2-core` dependency management definition to exclude the bcprov-ext-jdk15on library.  The `spring-security-saml2-core` depends on `com.narupley:not-going-to-be-commons-ssl` that in turn depends on `bcprov-ext-jdk15on` version 1.60.  The current version of NiFi depends on the standard `bcprov-jdk15on` library version 1.68 so inclusion of the different version of the extension library could cause unexpected problems at runtime.  The Spring Security SAML2 library does not appear to needed the obscure algorithm classes included in the `bcprov-ext-jdk15on` library, so the library should be excluded from bundled dependencies.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdded defensive code to make sure usage operations are supported by the bean, otherwise skip them. Unit tests didn't seem appropriate for this case, to reproduce (and verify the fix) create a MonitorMemory reporting task and set the Memory Pool property to \"PS Eden Space\" or \"PS Survivor Space\". Also fixed a bug where `monitoredBean` doesn't get reset when the reporting task is stopped.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8132 Replaces uses of the MD5 Message Digest algorithm with SHA-256 and provides a standardized implementation using a new `MessageDigestUtils` class in `nifi-utils`.  The SHA-256 algorithm does not have any noticeable performance differences versus MD5 on modern hardware.  Framework updates include replacement of MD5 in the following key classes:\r\n\r\n- ClassLoaderUtils\r\n- FileUtils\r\n- NarUnpacker\r\n\r\nAdditional updates include replacing identifier generation in the Hortonworks `SchemaRegistryClient`.  Remaining changes are related to unit tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-28T22:41:06Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T22:54:47Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T22:54:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"841e93c612fffa70a4bda584d935fea62c948257","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4788/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4788/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4788/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/db25383f8fd5fa21884f539a0ce39aabcf90f2f8","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-8132","ref":"NIFI-8132","sha":"db25383f8fd5fa21884f539a0ce39aabcf90f2f8","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8177 Adds `pollSenderPool()` to `AbstractPutEventProcessor` to avoid blocking indefinitely in `pruneIdleSenders()` and other methods.  The `pollSenderPool()` returns `null` immediately if the sender pool is empty, following the existing behavior of `LinkedBlockingQueue.poll()`.  Introducing a timeout of 250 ms avoids the potential for timeouts during unit tests on some systems.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

caused by newer versions of Jedis\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nI've found out that RedisDistributedMapCacheClientService is not compatible with newer versions of jedis. In particular, this change is breaking: https://github.com/redis/jedis/pull/1368\r\nThis is included in all versions after 2.9.0. (including bugfix versions 2.9.1+)\r\n\r\nTo ensure compatibility with newer jedis versions in the (global) classpath (which is unfortunately the only way to go sometimes), a null response from redis is treated the same as an empty list returned from the exec() method.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe call to DatabaseMetaData.getPrimaryKeys() was passing `null` for the schema name instead of the one (optionally) specified by the user. Also added more debug logging and refactored the unit tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-25T21:48:02Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T20:01:12Z","closed_at":"2021-02-05T20:01:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"afe659d61b6e70b440642cc770c6aac90bd71c7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4782/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4782/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4782/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/ba53909d4920886894961e8908c3f1e13b78418f","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-8172","ref":"NIFI-8172","sha":"ba53909d4920886894961e8908c3f1e13b78418f","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8171 Upgrades Bouncy Castle Security Provider and related libraries from 1.66 to 1.68.  This PR also centralizes the managed dependency version in the root Maven configuration to avoid different versions in extension bundles.  The Bouncy Castle Security Provider is configured using Security.addProvider(), which impacts the entire system, so different dependency versions should not be allowed.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

originally planning to add some type of property to control whether x509 should come before JWT, but it seems as though we should be able to just move JWT in front of it. The only scenario that would change behavior is if you were previously submitting a request to the API with a client cert AND also sending the Authorization header. Previously the Authorization header would be ignored, so arguably should not have been sent anyway.

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nHive is mostly case-insensitive but in the case where tables are backed by Avro, the field names in the embedded Avro schemas must exactly match the corresponding table columns. For this kind of use case, it would be helpful to (optionally) update the record schema to match the table schema exactly. To update the record schema, all records have to be rewritten, so a Record Writer property (dependent on Update Field Names set to true) needs to be added.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8121 Updates `ListenHTTP` with an additional configuration option for the `Client Authentication` property to support automatic configuration of requiring or requesting client certificates based on the presence or absence of Trust Store properties in the configured `SSLContextService`.\r\n\r\nNiFi versions 1.12.1 and prior do not have the `Client Authentication` property and instead called `SslContextFactory.setNeedClientAuth(true)` when the configured `SSLContextService` included Trust Store properties.  The introduction of the `Client Authentication` property in PR #4687 for NIFI-1930 removed this implicit behavior and did not provide backward compatibility for configurations where `ListenHTTP` was configured for one-way TLS.  The changes included in this PR include a custom `ClientAuthentication` enum with a value of `AUTO` that `ListenHTTP` uses as the default property value.  This approach will maintain backward compatibility during an upgrade and also allow explicit configuration going forward.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8120 Adds `RuntimeException` handling for both invocations of `HttpContextMap.complete()` in `HandleHttpResponse` Processor.  PR #1567 for NIFI-3517 introduced calling `HttpContextMap.complete()` when `HandleHttpResponse` failed to send Flow File contents to the HTTP output stream.  In cases where the HTTP client has disconnected, however, `HttpContextMap.complete()` can throw an `IllegalStateException`, wrapping a `java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException` when attempting to close the server connection.  This change includes updated unit tests to confirm that Flow Files will be routed to failure when this situation occurs.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

retrieved from disk. It only checks whether the protocol has changed but it doesn't check the URIs.\r\nIf the user changes the URIs to another instance, RPG not only keeps the old instance but also add the new instance to the state. the RPG will have two different instances at the same time and show the errors when transmission.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, I stored additional information into persistence files, this is used to check if the current target instance is matches with state persistence file in the disk.\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8096 Deprecates `createSSLContext()` methods in `SSLContextService` and adds a `createContext()` method that does not use the `ClientAuth` enumeration.  Updated extension components to use `SSLContextService.createContext()` in place of deprecated methods.\r\n\r\nRemoved references to `ClientAuth` from internal `SslContextFactory` class, and refactored framework classes to eliminate unnecessary usage of `ClientAuth`.  \r\n\r\nUpdated `ListenHTTP` to call `SslContextBuilder.Server.setNeedClientAuth(true)` when the `Client Authentication` property is `REQUIRED` and call `setWantClientAuth(true)` when the `Client Authentication` property is `WANT`.\r\n\r\nThese changes remove attempts in `SslContextFactory` to modify the default `SSLParameters` object, which is a read-only representation for the Java Virtual Machine configuration.  Deprecating methods on `SSLContextService` that use `ClientAuth` is necessary to clarify component behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8023 Added `DataTypeUtils.toLocalDate()` method for use in `AvroTypeUtil` to determine epoch days when logical date types enabled.\r\n\r\nUpdated `DataTypeUtils.toDate()` with new `parseDate()` method that evaluates the format pattern of `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` to determine whether a Time Zone field `Z` is present in the pattern.  This conditional adjustment is necessary because absence of the Time Zone Field in a `java.text.SimpleDateFormat` pattern definition produces different results depending on the system time zone configuration.\r\n\r\nThis approach resolves a latent issue when using the `DataTypeUtils.toDate()` method to parse a string that does not contain any time zone information.  Changes to `DataTypeUtils.toDate()` and updates to unit tests in referencing classes indicate the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8094 Adds support for Bouncy Castle FIPS Key Store (BCFKS) in framework components and StandardSSLContextService. BCFKS provides improved security for storage of certificates and private keys using AES-CCM and PKBDF2 algorithms for encryption of entries.  Components leveraging SSLContextService.createSSLContext() can support BCFKS with no additional changes.  Components that implement custom key store initialization may require additional work to support BCFKS.  The implementation leverages the existing Bouncy Castle Security Provider library and updates the KeystoreType enumeration along with related unit tests for KeystoreUtils.\r\n\r\nThe Java Keytool command can be used to convert JKS or PKCS12 keystores to BCFKS by referencing the Bouncy Castle Security Provider library and provider class using the following command:\r\n\r\n`keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.jks -destkeystore keystore.bcfks -deststoretype BCFKS -providerpath bcprov-jdk15on-1.66.jar -providerclass org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider`\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8088 Removes KeyStoreUtils.getTrustStore() method which logged a deprecation warning for PKCS12 trust stores. JEP 229 changed the default key store type to PKCS12 starting in Java 9.  The getTrustStore() method checked the trust store type and delegated to the getKeyStore() method, so this PR refactors replaces references to getTrustStore() with getKeyStore() to provide the same functionality.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds keyboard functionality to the custom tabbs jquery plugin.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nBuild NiFi locally, open the UI and locate anywhere that uses tabs (for example, inside the Global Menu's Summary window). Click on a tab. Navigate to the next tab by pressing the Tab key. Navigate back to the previous tab with Shift + Tab. Select a tab by focusing on it and pressing Enter or Space. You'll notice focus styles have been added.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds keyboard functionality and aria labelling to checkboxes in NiFi.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nBuild NiFi and click on a checkbox (for example, inside the Configure Processor's Settings tab). You should be able to check/uncheck the checkbox with your space bar. If you inspect the div.nf-checkbox element, you'll see the aria-checked value toggle true/false. The checkbox should be added to the tab order of the page, and each checkbox now has a focus style matching the default stylings of supported browsers.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

PR allows RPG to modify the target nifi instance URIs again after RPG is created.\r\n\r\nthe original step, when the RPG start transmit, it will compare the protocol only. if protocol changed, it will discard the state from disk\r\n\r\nIf user change the URIs to another instance, RPG not only keep the old instance but also add new instance to the state. the RPG will have two different instance at same time and show the errors when transmission. \r\n\r\nin order to check if user change the URIs, I stored addition information into persistence files, this is used to check if the current target instance is match with state persistence file in disk.\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the compilation step into the configurator's init() method. It doesn't really change the behavior since in most cases we call init() and eval() right afterward, but this is cleaner and would support components that need to initialize separately from evaluation. Also added a unit test for ScriptedReportingTask with Jython to validate the changes\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-09T19:27:13Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T02:51:23Z","closed_at":"2020-12-10T02:51:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06a526f52473a315cab687d97b6f2496aed6d953","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4718/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4718/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4718/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/f05f59e11e14cc31f0b36e31d0b3023b7a4bb76a","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-8080","ref":"NIFI-8080","sha":"f05f59e11e14cc31f0b36e31d0b3023b7a4bb76a","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

is my proposal for support HTTP based Splunk put with HEC Index Acknowledgement. This later makes it possible to build flows capable to wait for Splunk acknowledgement. This is reached with introducing two new processors, PutSplunkHTTP and QuerySplunkIndexingStatus.\r\n\r\nPutSplunkHTTP provides a similar functionality as PutSplunk, just instead of TCP/UDP, it uses HTTP as transfer protocol. Because of the structure of PutSplunk, it was not strait-forward to extend that, and also InvokeHTTP was not capable to cover the functionality.\r\n\r\nQuerySplunkIndexingStatus is the other added processor, responsible for looking after the indexing acknowledgements after PutSplunkHTTP. It is optional, without it the behaviour is similar as in case of PutSplunk. Both processors are built around the Service class provided by the Splunk library just as in case of GetSplunk.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7885 Introduces a Boolean environment variable named NIFI_HDFS_DENY_LOCAL_FILE_SYSTEM_ACCESS that be set to _true_ in order to deny access from HDFS Processors to the Local File System.  This change impacts all Processors that extend AbstractHadoopProcessor.  The evaluation occurs during Processor scheduling when retrieving the initial FileSystem object based on the provided Hadoop Configuration.  Setting the environment variable to _true_ will caused an AccessDeniedException to be thrown if an operator attempts to configure access to the Local File System.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

configuring processors.\r\n\r\nChanged to check the length of all unfiltered properties instead of only filtered properties.\r\nAdded additional check if descriptor is a dynamic property.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Fixed a bug due to the recent NIFI-1121 of dependent properties. After deleting a dynamic property while configuring processor properties, it would return the deleted dynamic property back to the UI. Added an additional check for dynamic properties that are set for deletion. Also fixed an error that didn't allow adding dynamic properties by checking all unfiltered properties instead of only filtered properties._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
