Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug with group by limit pushdown which causes incorrect query results when grouping on string columns ... TBD.\r\n\r\nThis is done by adding two new flags to `ColumnCapabilities`, `areDictionaryValuesSorted` and `areDictionaryValuesUnique`, which both must be true for pushdown to occur, and checking for their presence when deciding whether or not pushdown can occur in `HashAggregateIterator`.\r\n\r\n`Capabilities` has been removed since the `dimensionValuesSorted` it provided is now more granularly provided by `ColumnCapabilities`.\r\n\r\nA new `enum` has been introduced to provide a tri-state boolean for `ColumnCapabilities`:\r\n```\r\n  enum Capable\r\n  {\r\n    FALSE,\r\n    TRUE,\r\n    UNKNOWN;\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nin favor of adding them as booleans. As a follow-up, I intend to replace the other booleans on `ColumnCapabilities` with `Capable` so that we can remove `ColumnCapabilities.isComplete` and instead check for individual capabilities. \r\n\r\n#### simple example that illustrates the bug\r\ngiven rows\r\n```\r\ndim1, dim2\r\n----------\r\n'a', 'aa'\r\n'a', 'ab'\r\n'a', 'ba\r\n```\r\nand the following query\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  dim1, substring(dim2, 1, 1), count(*)\r\nFROM\r\n  exampleRows\r\nGROUP BY 1,2\r\nLIMIT 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nprior to the changes in this PR the results would be\r\n```\r\n[['a', 'a', 2]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nrather than the expected:\r\n```\r\n[['a', 'a', 2],['a', 'b', 1]]\r\n```\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

changes that simplify how joins are planned:\r\n\r\n1) Stop using JoinProjectTransposeRule as a way of guiding subquery\r\nremoval. Instead, add logic to DruidJoinRule that identifies removable\r\nsubqueries and removes them at the point of creating a DruidJoinQueryRel.\r\nThis approach reduces the size of the planning space and allows the\r\nplanner to complete quickly.\r\n\r\n2) Remove rules that reorder joins. Not because of an impact on the\r\nplanning time (it seems minimal), but because the decisions that the\r\nplanner was making in the new tests were sometimes worse than the\r\nuser-provided order. I think we'll need to go with the user-provided\r\norder for now, and revisit reordering when we can add more smarts to\r\nthe cost estimator.\r\n\r\nA third change updates numeric ExprEval classes to store their\r\nvalue as a boxed type that corresponds to what it is supposed to be.\r\nThis is useful because it affects the behavior of \"asString\", and\r\nis included in this patch because it is needed for the new test\r\n\"testInnerJoinTwoLookupsToTableUsingNumericColumnInReverse\". This\r\ntest relies on CAST('6', 'DOUBLE') stringifying to \"6.0\" like an\r\nactual double would.\r\n\r\nFixes

Description\r\nThis PR begins to refactor the Druid internal column type system in an effort to one day live in a world where we can have complete information about the types of all columns taking part in a query - at all layers, i.e. a complete `RowSignature` and `ColumnCapabilities`. \r\n\r\n**tl;dr** this PR consolidates `ValueType` enums, adds type information to `PostAggregator`, and adds finalized type information to `AggregatorFactory`.\r\n\r\nThe 2 separate `ValueType` enumerations have been consolidated, and now live in `druid-core`. The methods in `ValueType` which required `druid-processing` have been migrated into static methods in a new `ValueTypes` static class, which takes a `ValueType` and produces a `makeNumericWrappingDimensionSelector` or `makeNewSettableColumnValueSelector` as appropriate. There might be a better home for this, perhaps `RowSignature` or .. somewhere? \r\n\r\n`PostAggregator` now has a new method:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ValueType getType();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand will now correctly populate a `RowSignature` instead of setting the type to `null`.\r\n\r\nTo support type information on `PostAggregator`, `AggregatorFactory` also has 2 new methods:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public abstract ValueType getType();\r\n\r\n  public abstract ValueType getFinalizedType();\r\n```\r\n\r\nso that finalized type information is available to correctly compute the output type of `FinalizingFieldAccessPostAggregator`. This also means that finalized type information for aggregators _could_ be available in a finalized view of a `RowSignature`, but I have not made this modification yet. `AggregatorFactory.getTypeName` has been renamed to `getComplexTypeName` and transitioned to be exclusively used for complex type serde lookup.\r\n\r\nBecause a lot of postaggs produce `double` typed arrays in their results, and in anticipation of what I think might be a good idea to do next which is merge `ValueType` and `ExprType`, I went ahead and added array types to the new and improved `ValueType` enumeration. The complete set is now:\r\n```\r\n  DOUBLE,\r\n  FLOAT,\r\n  LONG,\r\n  STRING,\r\n  COMPLEX,\r\n  DOUBLE_ARRAY,\r\n  LONG_ARRAY,\r\n  STRING_ARRAY\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps controversial and worth discussion, but it also doesn't seem to introduce any ill effects as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nSince this PR adds types for almost every _other_ type of column, we should now be able to have nearly complete type information for all inputs when we are constructing an `Expr` for `ExpressionVirtualColumn` and `ExpressionPostAggregator` and `ExpressionFilter` and anything else using `Expr`. This means that as a follow-up we should also be able to allow an `Expr` to compute it's output `ValueType` based on its inputs, making explicit user specification no longer necessary. I suspect we could also use it for type specific optimizations to help make expressions faster, and more.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ValueType` + `ValueType` = `ValueType`\r\n * `RowSignature`\r\n * like every `PostAggregator` and

Description\r\n\r\nA follow-up of #9608. Even with common subfilters elimination, the CNF conversion can result in a suboptimal CNF which is usually huge. One example is `A && B && ((C && D && E) || (C && D && F))`. The CNF conversion returned `((C || E) && (D || E) && (C || F) && (D || F) && C && D && (D || C) && A && B (F || E))` prior to this PR.\r\n\r\nI adopted the `RexUtil.pullFactors()` from Apache Calcite which seems to be able to address this issue. However, by its design, it can create a conjunctive form which is not necessarily a CNF. Since we still need CNF, I modified `toCnf()` method to call the adopted `pull()` method and then perform the existing CNF conversion. I added more unit tests to verify the modified behavior. Also, to verify that the filter is equivalent after conversion, I added a verification that checks the equivalence of filters by comparing their truth table.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

file format extensions for inputSource (orc, parquet)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds integration test coverage on inputSource using inputFormat of type ORC and Parquet. Since the different inputSources share code from AbstractInputSource, it is sufficient to add these new integration tests to just one inputSource. I have chosen to add these new integration tests to the hdfs inputSource. (Note that other inputSource such as S3, GCS, Azure, hdfs, local already have integration tests covering inputFormat of json type.) \r\nThe benefits of putting these new integration tests in the hdfs inputSource are \r\n- It is possible to add hdfs inputSource to our Travis/CI as hadoop cluster along with the necessary data files can be setup with the docker test script (while it is possible for cloud input sources)   \r\n- It is easier to maintain and setup complex data files directory that is needed for the ingestionSpec using the docker test script (while it is more prone to error if left to user to setup manually)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue spotted by LGTM where strings provided by an HTTP request to the `ShuffleResource` used by native batch indexing were not checked, allowing paths to be supplied

fail prior to this PR and serve to illustrate the bug. I moved logic of `DataSchema. validateDatasourceName` and `RandomIdUtils` into `druid-core` under `TaskIdUtils` so that this logic could be recycled to ensure that the `supervisorTaskId` are chill to use.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Hadoop inputSource integration tests to use parallel batch ingestion\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPreviously we were forced to use the simple batch ingestion for Hadoop InputSource integration tests because of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9574\r\nHowever, now that https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9574 is fixed, we can switch Hadoop InputSource integration test to use parallel batch ingestion which is a more comprehensive test case (creating sub task, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

NPE in RemoteTaskRunner event handler causes JVM shutdown\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAn overlord can encountered the following NPE and subsequently triggered a JVM

following code reproduced below:\r\n```\r\ncatch (Exception e) {\r\nlog.makeAlert(e, \"Failed to handle new worker status\")\r\n.addData(\"worker\", zkWorker.getWorker().getHost())\r\n.addData(\"znode\", event.getData().getPath())\r\n.emit();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method needs a null check for `event.getData()`, since data can be null: https://curator.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/curator/framework/recipes/cache/PathChildrenCacheEvent.html\r\nAlso, added null checks for other parameters just to be safe.\r\n\r\nAlso updated the version of Curator to 4.3.0. Note that Curator version 4.3.0 has the fix for https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/8177 which earlier (before 4.3.0 exist) prevent us upgrading Curator's version.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\n`Filters.toCNF()` is used in 2 places, 1) to find prefilters when scanning segments that bitmaps are available to evaluate them and 2) to find filters which can be pushed down in a Join query. This function was adopted from Hive, but have some issues with optimization. One of issues is that it didn't eliminate common subfilters, which sometimes resulted in a huge number of subfilters which in turn could cause an OOM error. This PR is to eliminate those common subfilters by changing the type of subfilters of `AndFilter` and `OrFilter` from `List` to `Set`. This is to detect common subfilters of different orders, otherwise those subfilters should be sorted in some order which seems more complicated than using a `Set`.\r\n\r\nThe approach used in this PR can create a filter in a suboptimal CNF. There are at least 2 cases I'm aware of.\r\n\r\n- Even though `x IN (1,2,3)` is equivalent to `x = 1 OR x = 2 OR x = 3`, but this case is not handled yet. We may need to decide which form is more optimal (probably using `IN` filter is better since it will use less memory).\r\n- There are some missing cases which can be further reduced. For example, `(A || ~(E)) && (A || ~(F)) && (A || ~(E) || ~(F))` can be reduced as below. This case is not handled yet, but I left a comment about it in `FiltersTest.testToCNFWithComplexFilterIncludingNotAndOr()`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(A || ~(E)) && (A || ~(F)) && (A || ~(E) || ~(F))\r\n=> ((A && (~(E) || ~(F))) && (A || ~(E) || ~(F)))\r\n=> (A && (~(E) || ~(F))\r\n=> (A || ~(E)) && (A || ~(F))\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nLoad data and query (i.e., automate https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/tutorial-batch.html) to have some basic checks ensuring the web console is wired up to druid correctly.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThe new end-to-end tests (tutorial-batch.spec.ts) are added to\r\n`web-console/e2e-tests`. Within that directory:\r\n- `components` represent the various tabs of the web console. Currently,\r\n  abstractions for `load data`, `ingestion`, `datasources`, and `query`\r\n  are implemented.\r\n- `components/load-data/data-connector` contains abstractions for the\r\n  different data source options available to the data loader's `Connect`\r\n  step. Currently, only the `Local file` data source connector is\r\n  implemented.\r\n- `components/load-data/config` contains abstractions for the different\r\n  configuration options available for each step of the data loader flow.\r\n  Currently, the `Configure Schema`, `Partition`, and `Publish` steps\r\n  have initial implementation of their configuration options.\r\n- `util` contains various helper methods for the tests and does not\r\n  contain abstractions of the web console.\r\n\r\nChanges to add the new tests to CI:\r\n- `.travis.yml`: New \"web console end-to-end tests\" job\r\n- `web-console/jest.*.js`: Refactor jest configurations to have\r\n  different flavors for unit tests and for end-to-end tests. In\r\n  particular, the latter adds a jest setup configuration to wait for the\r\n  web console to be ready (`web-console/e2e-tests/util/setup.ts`).\r\n- `web-console/package.json`: Refactor run scripts to add new script for\r\n  running end-to-end tests.\r\n- `web-console/script/druid`: Utility scripts for building, starting,\r\n  and stopping druid.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- `pom.xml`: Refactor various settings disable java static checks and to\r\n  disable java tests into two new maven profiles. Since the same\r\n  settings are used in several places (e.g., .travis.yml, Dockerfiles,\r\n  etc.), having them in maven profiles makes it more maintainable.\r\n- `web-console/src/console-application.tsx`: Fix typo (\"the the\").\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-01T00:32:01Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T04:26:39Z","closed_at":"2020-04-09T19:38:10Z","merged_at":"2020-04-09T19:38:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"84c1c2505d30f3efbfbcede7557ad4dd90f19cff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vogievetsky","id":177816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky","html_url":"https://github.com/vogievetsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vogievetsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the `jetty/numOpenConnections` metric is double counted for SSL connections due to the way _all_ `ConnectionFactory` instances are wrapped in `JettyMonitoringConnectionFactory` in `JettyServerModule` initialization, instead of what I believe to be the correct usage of only monitoring the default `ConnectionFactory` for the `ServerConnector`. \r\n\r\nThe TLS `ServerConnector` is constructed with 2 `ConnectionFactory` instances:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n      final ServerConnector connector = new ServerConnector(\r\n          server,\r\n          new SslConnectionFactory(sslContextFactory, HTTP_1_1_STRING),\r\n          new HttpConnectionFactory(httpsConfiguration)\r\n      );\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding (and observation using the debugger) that _both_ create a connection, the `SslConnectionFactory` to un-encrypt the request connection, and the `HttpConnectionFactory` to do HTTP stuff to the now un-encrypted connection. However, since both of these were prior to this PR wrapped in `JettyMonitoringConnectionFactory`, a single TLS connection would count as 2 active connections, despite only 1 request being made. This PR modifies `JettyServerModule` to now only monitor the `ConnectionFactory` with the same protocol as the default `ServerConnector` protocol to correctly single count the connection.\r\n\r\nThe added test `JettyTest.testNumConnectionsMetricHttps` fails without the modifications to `JettyServerModule`. The keystore/truststore in the test resources were generated in the same manner as used in the integration tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis change fixes a bug that was introduced that causes ingestion\r\nto fail if data is ingested from one of the supported cloud storages\r\n(Azure, Google, S3), and the user is using another type of storage\r\nfor deep storage. In this case the all segment killer implementations\r\nare instantiated. A change recently made forced a dependency between\r\nthe supported cloud storage type SegmentKiller classes and the\r\ndeep storage configuration for that storage type being set, which\r\nforced the deep storage bucket and prefix to be non-null. This caused\r\na NullPointerException to be thrown when instantiating the\r\nSegmentKiller classes during ingestion.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, the respective deep storage segment configs for the\r\ncloud storage types supported in druid are now allowed to have nullable\r\nbucket and prefix configurations\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Integration Test for functionality of kinesis ingestion\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe new set of integration test for Kinesis follows the same concept as Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) that S3, GCS, Azure Integration tests uses (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9501). Basically, anyone running will have to provide their own Kinesis credentials in a conf file and pass the file to mvn using -Doverride.config.path\r\n\r\nAdded following Integration Test for functionality of kinesis ingestion:\r\n\r\n1. Functional tests when Druid and Kafka are in stable state\r\n- legacy parser\r\n- inputFormat\r\n- Greater than 1 taskCount\r\n\r\n2. Functional tests when Druid is in an unstable state \r\n- losing nodes\r\n- Stop/start supervisor\r\n\r\n3. Functional tests when Kafka is in an unstable state \r\n- adding partitions\r\n- removing partitions\r\n\r\nTo verify ingestion:\r\n- Kafka lag should be minimal, the consumer should be able to pull off the queue at a comparable rate to the producer.\r\n- Realtime queries works from the indexing tasks\r\n- Queries works reading from historical segments (after handed off)\r\n- Queries return expected count/value/etc.\r\n\r\nAdded integration test infrastructure/helper:\r\n- Data generator - Generate data to kinesis stream (Kafka can also be refactor to use this later)\r\n- DruidAdminClient - to control the Integration test's Druid Docker cluster\r\n- KinesisAdminClient - Create stream, delete stream, etc.\r\n- Since tests can fail or be killed un-expectedly, added druid-ci-expire-after tag to all stream created by integration test. The value to this tag is a timestamp that can be used by a lambda function to remove unused stream. (help make clean up easier)\r\n- Also made debugging integration test easier by automatically enabling debug mode and exposing debug port on integration test's druids docker processes\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nWe currently have decent number of tests for the aggregate, but even with them, we have been having hard time to write good tests verifying all edge cases. A most recent example could be a couple of bugs found in sql-compatible null handling mode. I think this is because we had to write every test from scratch due to the lack of a good framework.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new framework, `AggregateTestBase`, which generates random data including nulls for all data types. The data can be stored in either `IncrementalIndex` or `QueryableIndex` depending on a parameter, the caller can test reading from both of them. \r\n\r\nTo use the same data generator with our benchmarks in `AggregateTestBase`, I renamed some classes including `BenchmarkSchemaInfo`, `BenchmarkColumnSchema`, `BenchmarkDataGenerator`, `BenchmarkColumnValueGenerator` and moved them to `druid-processing`. Most of the changes in this PR are from this renaming.\r\n\r\nSome example tests are found in `LongSumAggregateTest`. This class tests only `aggregate()` and `bufferAggregate()` using the data generated by `AggregateTestBase`. There are a couple of more new tests in `LongSumAggregatorFactoryTest`, `LongSum(Buffer)AggregatorReplaceNullModeTest`, and `LongSum(Buffer)AggregatorSqlCompatibleModeTest`. They are more like unit tests verifying each method of the `LongSumAggregator`, `LongSumBufferAggregator`, and `LongSumAggregatorFactory`. Note that tests `AggregatorCombiner` and `MergingFactory` are not added in this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR partially squares up the joins work of #9503, #9533, and #9545 with the query laning added in #9407, by extending lane enforcement to queries that run with the `LocalQuerySegmentWalker` of `ClientQuerySegmentWalker`, fixing a bug that queries that _only_ use the `LocalQuerySegmentWalker` are not counted at all. This PR puts things into an interim state so that these queries can fall under lane enforcement, but it has a flaw that it will sequentially acquire and release lanes for each time the `ClientQuerySegmentWalker` invokes either its local or cluster walker to run a part of a query rather than acquiring all necessary lanes up front and holding through the duration of the query. This is not really an ideal state, since it opens the possibility to fail midway through if a query loses a lane to another query, but it is better than not counting them, and so worth doing for the short term I think.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we could bring up the call to `QueryScheduler.run` into `ClientQuerySegmentWalker` or even the http resources, but this isn't currently possible without a fairly heavy refactor of how the broker runs queries. This is due to how they are transformed on the way down, where `QueryScheduler.prioritizeAndLaneQuery` happens on in the deepest part of the cluster and local walkers runners right before they call `QueryScheduler.run` because that is when the segments participating in the query are available. I'm not quite sure what this will look like yet.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

change makes it easier to run integration tests against a quickstart cluster running on a local development machine.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this is debuggability, as you can have a local quickstart environment set up with remote debugging so you can easily put breakpoints in the cluster under test.\r\n\r\nThe other advantage of using this mode is that you can run an integration test against an older version of quickstart to verify that the test fails for older versions, but pass when the fix is applied in a newer version.","created_at":"2020-03-25T03:09:35Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T04:30:08Z","closed_at":"2020-03-26T20:22:53Z","merged_at":"2020-03-26T20:22:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6e2836b0e25f2b27816c514c5064e6516e60d7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":145651458,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDU2NTE0NTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Ease%20of%20Use","name":"Ease

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an integer overflow issue if too many values are written to a column within a single segment, preferring to fail at segment creation time instead of write a sad segment with negative values. \r\n\r\nThis issue was first noticed with multi-value columns, exploding at query time with an error of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.druid.java.util.common.IAE: Index[-131072] < 0\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.data.GenericIndexed.checkIndex(GenericIndexed.java:269)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.data.GenericIndexed.access$300(GenericIndexed.java:79)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.data.GenericIndexed$3.get(GenericIndexed.java:696)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.data.CompressedVSizeColumnarIntsSupplier$CompressedVSizeColumnarInts.loadBuffer(CompressedVSizeColumnarIntsSupplier.java:437)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.data.CompressedVSizeColumnarIntsSupplier$CompressedVSizeColumnarInts.get(CompressedVSizeColumnarIntsSupplier.java:350)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.segment.data.SliceIndexedInts.get(SliceIndexedInts.java:60)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut would also occur for any serializer given more than `Integer.MAX_VALUES` rows as input. tl;dr too many values were written to a single segment so the 'offsets' portion of the multi-value column overflowed into negative numbers.\r\n\r\nTo fix, primitive column serializers now check the number of values (row count in most cases, total number of values for the case of multi-value strings) to ensure that it does not extend beyond the values that will be expressed in the column header and won't cause any issues at query time. A new exception, `ColumnCapacityExceededException` has been added which will give an error message that suggests \r\n\r\n```\r\nToo many values to store for %s column, try reducing maxRowsPerSegment\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `%s` is the column name (which all the serializers now know).\r\n\r\nI added a bunch of tests to confirm that this works, and also marked them all `@Ignore` because they take forever to run. The same `IAE` error can be replicated by running `V3CompressedVSizeColumnarMultiIntsSerializerTest.testTooManyValues` without the modifications to check that overflow has occurred.\r\n\r\nI also added a `CompressedDoublesSerdeTest` that copies `CompressedFloatsSerdeTest` since i noticed there wasn't a test for double columns.\r\n\r\nFinally, I ran into an issue with `IntermediateColumnarLongsSerializer` that made it so that I could not test the case when you write too many values to the column, as it _must store the entire column on heap_ while it determines the best encoding, so my attempts to run the test were met with an oom exception. This should probably be fixed, or we should advise against using 'auto' encoding for larger segments, but I did neither in this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Hadoop ingestion fails due to error \"JavaScript is disabled\", if determine partition map reduce job is run and \"mapreduce.reduce.java.opts\" + \"mapreduce.map.java.opts\" is not set with druid.javascript.enabled=true\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the failure is depending on if the determine_partitions map reduce job needs to be run or not. If the determine_partitions map reduce job needs to be run, then it will fail with the \"JavaScript is disabled\" error if \"mapreduce.reduce.java.opts\" + \"mapreduce.map.java.opts\" is not set with druid.javascript.enabled=true. This is due to peon not sending the druid.javascript.enabled value (that is set in the _common/common.runtime.properties) to hadoop when running the determine_partitions map reduce job\r\n\r\nThe determine_partitions is run for many configuration settings. For example, if \"maxRowsPerSegment\" is null but numShard is also null, then maxRowsPerSegment is internally set to default value of 5000000 and the determine_partitions job is run.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simply to include the druid.javascript.enabled prop when running the determine_partitions map reduce job (similar to how we do when we send the index-generator map reduce job. (Note that the druid.javascript.enabled is inject correctly for index-generator job).\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround is to pass the druid.javascript.enabled=true in \"mapreduce.map.java.opts\" and \"mapreduce.reduce.java.opts\" in addition to setting druid.javascript.enabled=true in _common/common.runtime.properties\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

ingestion spec should not uses the default credentials provider chain when environment value password provider is misconfigured.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug that S3 ingestion spec uses the default credentials provider chain when environment value password provider is misconfigured. The new and correct behavior is that If environment value password provider is misconfigured or any other cases that resulted in the s3 access key and/or s3 secret key from the PasswordProvider being null, the ingestion will failed. The task logs will then surface error message \"IllegalArgumentException: Access key cannot be null\" to let the user that Access key or secret key was null. Note that ingestion will also fail if only one PasswordProvider is configured (PasswordProvider given for Access key but not Secret key OR PasswordProvider given for Secret key but not Access key).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nI think it is finally time to switch to using Roaring bitmaps instead of using CONCISE by default. Using Druid with Roaring is rather well tested by now, and in most cases I think it is going to provide a better out of the box experience, where the speed is generally worth the potential for larger segment sizes that come with high cardinalities. There will still exist cases of datasets with ultra high cardinality columns where CONCISE might produce smaller segments due to the overhead of the Roaring format, but it makes sense to me for the operator to opt into the decision of wanting the smallest possible segments at the potential cost of speed, rather than that being the default.\r\n\r\nRelated: http://db.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sidm338-wangA.pdf (though this paper is using a from scratch custom version of roaring apparently)\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

to SQL module:\r\n\r\n- DruidJoinRule: Allow joins on subqueries (left/right are no longer\r\n  required to be scans or mappings).\r\n- DruidJoinRel: Add cost estimation code for joins on subqueries.\r\n- DruidSemiJoinRule, DruidSemiJoinRel: Removed, since DruidJoinRule can\r\n  handle this case now.\r\n- DruidRel: Remove Nullable annotation from toDruidQuery, because\r\n  it is no longer needed (it was used by DruidSemiJoinRel).\r\n- Update Rules constants to reflect new rules available in our current\r\n  version of Calcite. Some of these are useful for optimizing joins on\r\n  subqueries.\r\n- Rework cost estimation to be in terms of cost per row, and place all\r\n  relevant constants in CostEstimates.\r\n- Remove maxQueryCount and maxSemiJoinRowsInMemory properties\r\n  from the SQL layer, since the responsibility for handling subqueries has\r\n  moved down into the native query layer. There's no replacement for\r\n  maxQueryCount (I don't think it's necessary). The replacement for\r\n  maxSemiJoinRowsInMemory is maxSubqueryRows.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- RowBasedColumnSelectorFactory: Don't set hasMultipleValues. The lack\r\n  of isComplete is enough to let callers know that columns might have\r\n  multiple values, and explicitly setting it to true causes\r\n  ExpressionSelectors to think it definitely has multiple values, and\r\n  treat the inputs as arrays. This behavior interfered with some of the\r\n  new tests that involved queries on lookups.\r\n- QueryContexts: Add maxSubqueryRows parameter, and use it in druid-sql\r\n  tests.","created_at":"2020-03-20T15:32:37Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:15:15Z","closed_at":"2020-03-22T23:43:56Z","merged_at":"2020-03-22T23:43:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"54c9325256c33622bc8d198dc0252a157f68f196","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release
