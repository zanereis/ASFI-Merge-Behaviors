What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when reading of a Parquet file written with legacy mode would fail due to incorrect Parquet LIST to ArrayType conversion.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises when using schema evolution and utilising the parquet-mr reader. 2-level LIST annotated types could be parsed incorrectly as 3-level LIST annotated types because their underlying element type does not match the full inferred Catalyst schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt appears to be a long-standing issue with the legacy mode due to the imprecise check in ParquetRowConverter that was trying to determine Parquet backward compatibility using Catalyst schema: `DataType.equalsIgnoreCompatibleNullability(guessedElementType, elementType)` in https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetRowConverter.scala#L606.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new test case in ParquetInteroperabilitySuite.scala.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-20T00:44:52Z","updated_at":"2021-09-22T10:13:59Z","closed_at":"2021-09-22T09:40:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e200d6c732c4e5fcd623312b009af2ad467c6f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34044/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34044/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34044/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8a21e051130f1c360ea4432a9c1ffda9cb27865c","head":{"label":"sadikovi:parquet-legacy-write-mode-list-issue","ref":"parquet-legacy-write-mode-list-issue","sha":"8a21e051130f1c360ea4432a9c1ffda9cb27865c","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDelegate potentially blocking call to `mapOutputTracker.updateMapOutput` from within  `UpdateBlockInfo` from `dispatcher-BlockManagerMaster` to the threadpool to avoid blocking the endpoint. This code path is only accessed for `ShuffleIndexBlockId`, other blocks are still executed on the `dispatcher-BlockManagerMaster` itself.\r\n\r\nChange `updateBlockInfo` to return `Future[Boolean]` instead of `Boolean`. Response will be sent to RPC caller upon successful completion of the future. \r\n\r\nIntroduce a unit test that forces `MapOutputTracker` to make a broadcast as part of `MapOutputTracker.serializeOutputStatuses` when running decommission tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n[SPARK-36782](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36782) describes a deadlock occurring if the `dispatcher-BlockManagerMaster` is allowed to block while waiting for write access to data structures.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test as introduced in this PR.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPing @eejbyfeldt for notice.","created_at":"2021-09-19T21:25:44Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T08:54:22Z","closed_at":"2021-09-23T04:57:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99f0eed2e4d59bfe83a5bfe7982078dbabd5d1bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34043/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34043/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34043/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/26b3b1118cc9701127c359b69b25ecf3a023c748","head":{"label":"f-thiele:SPARK-36782","ref":"SPARK-36782","sha":"26b3b1118cc9701127c359b69b25ecf3a023c748","user":{"login":"f-thiele","id":16508158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTA4MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16508158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele","html_url":"https://github.com/f-thiele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":407217403,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDcyMTc0MDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"f-thiele/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"f-thiele","id":16508158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTA4MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16508158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele","html_url":"https://github.com/f-thiele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f-thiele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/f-thiele/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to generalize the resolving-by-position behavior to nested columns for Union.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnion, by the API definition, resolves columns by position. Currently we only follow this behavior at top-level columns, but not nested columns.\r\n\r\nAs we are making nested columns as first-class citizen, the nested-column-only limitation and the difference between top-level column and nested column do not make sense. We should also resolve nested columns like top-level columns for Union.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. After this change, Union also resolves nested columns by position.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor LEFT SEMI and LEFT ANTI hash equi-join without extra join condition, we only need to keep one row per unique join key(s) inside hash table (`HashedRelation`) when building the hash table. This can help reduce the size of hash table of join.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the optimization in `UnsafeHashedRelation` for broadcast hash join and shuffled hash join. The optimization for `LongHashedRelation` would be added later in the future, because it needs more change of underlying hash table data structure `LongToUnsafeRowMap` to check if key exists in hash table or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nHelp reduce the hash table size of join for LEFT SEMI and LEFT ANTI.\r\nThis can increase the chance of broadcast join of these queries, and reduce OOM possibility of shuffled hash join.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `JoinSuite.scala`.\r\n\r\nJust to help easier review, as a lot of files are changed due to unit test plan change.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the CatalogImpl for user-facing catalog API.\r\nbefore:\r\n`private def sessionCatalog: SessionCatalog = sparkSession.sessionState.catalog`\r\nSo all the operations we did were based on SessionCatalog any time.\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n`private def currentCatalog: CatalogPlugin = sparkSession.sessionState.catalogManager.currentCatalog`\r\nWhen current catalog is `spark-catalog`, we do the all operations based on SessionCatalog.\r\nOthers CatalogPlugin did not support operations  at now. it will throw exception temporarily.\r\neg: `databaseExists` ,`currentDatabase` and so on.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n[#SPARK-36790](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36790)\r\nUser-facting catalog should be access the current catalog.\r\neg:\r\n`\r\nspark.sql(\"use testcat\")\r\n`\r\nso: current catalog != spark.catalog\r\n\r\n`\r\nspark.sql(\"use testcat.ns1\")\r\n`\r\nso: current database != spark.catalog.currentDatabase\r\n\r\n`spark.sql(\"show tables\")\r\n`\r\nso: result != spark.catalog.listTables\r\n\r\nI think the SparkSession.catalog api should be keep exist instead of SparkSession.sessionState.catalogManager. So update user-facing catalog to adapt CatalogPlugin. At now just throw exception for unsupport the CatalogPlugin temporary.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change? \r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd ut

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to fix incorrect schema of `union`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current `union` result of nested struct columns is incorrect. By definition of `union` API, it should resolve columns by position, not by name. Right now when determining the `output` (aka. the schema) of union plan, we use `merge` API which actually merges two structs (simply think it as concatenate fields from two structs if not overlapping). The merging behavior doesn't match the `union` definition.\r\n\r\nSo currently we get incorrect schema but the query result is correct. We should fix the incorrect schema.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixing a bug of incorrect schema.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n When a DNS issue happens on the executor node, shuffle nodes would get added to the exclude list due to FetchFailed exception. The change here is to have a configuration host value to test DNS resolution against before marking it as a FetchFailed Exception.\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n This would prevent shuffle nodes from getting added to the exclude list due to DNS issues\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n No\r\n\r\n ### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n Added Unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`ScanOperation` collects adjacent Projects and Filters. The caller side always assume that the collected Filters should run before collected Projects, which means `ScanOperation` effectively pushes Filter through Project.\r\n\r\nFollowing `PushPredicateThroughNonJoin`, we should not push Filter through nondeterministic Project. This PR fixes `ScanOperation` to follow this rule.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a bug that violates the semantic of nondeterministic expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nMost likely no change, but in some cases, this is a correctness bug fix which changes the query result.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds the pyspark API `df.withMetadata(columnName, metadata)`. The scala API is added in this PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33853.\r\n \r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTo make it easy to use/modify the semantic annotation, we want to have a shorter API to update the metadata in a dataframe. Currently we have `df.withColumn(\"col1\", col(\"col1\").alias(\"col1\", metadata=metadata))` to update the metadata without changing the column name, and this is too verbose. We want to have a syntax suger API `df.withMetadata(\"col1\", metadata=metadata)` to achieve the same functionality.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nA bit of background for the frequency of the update: We are working on inferring the semantic data types and use them in AutoML and store the semantic annotation in the metadata. So in many cases, we will suggest the user update the metadata to correct the wrong inference or add the annotation for weak inference.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nA syntax suger API `df.withMetadata(\"col1\", metadata=metadata)` to achieve the same functionality as`df.withColumn(\"col1\", col(\"col1\").alias(\"col1\", metadata=metadata))`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\ndoctest.","created_at":"2021-09-16T13:39:45Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T00:31:10Z","closed_at":"2021-09-24T00:30:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"36197f5ffbc2dda0a76611631c85f71e7e0fa343","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34021/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34021/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34021/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/28faa2e5070eb53abd24cb64af78d67222960e0a","head":{"label":"liangz1:withMetadataPython","ref":"withMetadataPython","sha":"28faa2e5070eb53abd24cb64af78d67222960e0a","user":{"login":"liangz1","id":7851093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTEwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7851093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangz1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":263092270,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMwOTIyNzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"liangz1/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liangz1","id":7851093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTEwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7851093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangz1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangz1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liangz1/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove the appAttemptId from TransportConf, and parsing through SparkEnv. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPush based shuffle will fail if

tested?\r\nTested within our Yarn cluster.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors test code in order to improve the debugability of `SparkSubmitSuite`.\r\n\r\nThe `sql/hive` module contains a `SparkSubmitTestUtils` helper class which launches `spark-submit` and captures its output in order to display better error messages when tests fail. This helper is currently used by `HiveSparkSubmitSuite` and `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite`, but isn't used by `SparkSubmitSuite`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I moved `SparkSubmitTestUtils` and `ProcessTestUtils` into the `core` module and updated `SparkSubmitSuite`, `BufferHolderSparkSubmitSuite`, and `WholestageCodegenSparkSubmitSuite` to use the relocated helper classes. This required me to change `SparkSubmitTestUtils` to make its timeouts configurable and to generalize its method for locating the `spark-submit` binary.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, `SparkSubmitSuite` tests would fail with messages like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - launch simple application with spark-submit *** FAILED *** (1 second, 832 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   Process returned with exit code 101. See the log4j logs for more detail. (SparkSubmitSuite.scala:1551)\r\n[info]   org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException:\r\n[info]   at org.scalatest.Assertions.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:472)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich require the Spark developer to hunt in log4j logs in order to view the logs from the failed `spark-submit` command. \r\n\r\nAfter this change, those tests will fail with detailed error messages that include the text of failed command plus timestamped logs captured from the failed proces:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - launch simple application with spark-submit *** FAILED *** (2 seconds, 800 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   spark-submit returned with exit code 101.\r\n[info]   Command line: '/Users/joshrosen/oss-spark/bin/spark-submit' '--class' 'invalidClassName' '--name' 'testApp' '--master' 'local' '--conf' 'spark.ui.enabled=false' '--conf' 'spark.master.rest.enabled=false' 'file:/Users/joshrosen/oss-spark/target/tmp/spark-0a8a0c93-3aaf-435d-9cf3-b97abd318d91/testJar-1631768004882.jar'\r\n[info]\r\n[info]   2021-09-15 21:53:26.041 - stderr> SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.\r\n[info]   2021-09-15 21:53:26.042 - stderr> SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/joshrosen/oss-spark/assembly/target/scala-2.12/jars/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.30.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\n[info]   2021-09-15 21:53:26.042 - stderr> SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/Users/joshrosen/.m2/repository/org/slf4j/slf4j-log4j12/1.7.30/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.30.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\n[info]   2021-09-15 21:53:26.042 - stderr> SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.\r\n[info]   2021-09-15 21:53:26.042 - stderr> SLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerFactory]\r\n[info]   2021-09-15 21:53:26.619 - stderr> Error: Failed to load class invalidClassName.

Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually ran the affected test suites.","created_at":"2021-09-16T04:48:17Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T00:16:59Z","closed_at":"2021-09-16T21:30:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"28566099ffd48d578cb8291c0924d37474d75954","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34013/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34013/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34013/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ad5c38c4f758de38d335cada58425aeed224281","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-36774-move-SparkSubmitTestUtils-to-core","ref":"SPARK-36774-move-SparkSubmitTestUtils-to-core","sha":"5ad5c38c4f758de38d335cada58425aeed224281","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

This process will be repeated on each incoming row, which causes the high run-time complexity.\r\n\r\nBut UnboundedPrecedingWindowFunctionFrame has much better time complexity O(N), N is the number of rows in the current partition.\r\n\r\n \r\n**What is the idea of the improvement?**\r\n\r\nGive the big time complexity difference between UnboundedFollowingWindowFunctionFrame and UnboundedPrecedingWindowFunctionFrame, we can do following conversions to improve the time complexity of first() and last() from O(N^2) to O(N)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase 1:\r\nfirst() OVER(PARTITION BY colA ORDER BY colB ASC ROWS CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) \r\nconverts to \r\nlast()  OVER(PARTITION BY colA ORDER BY colB DEAC ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)\r\n\r\ncase 2:\r\nlast()  OVER(PARTITION BY colA ORDER BY colB ASC ROWS CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) \r\nconverts to \r\nfirst() OVER(PARTITION BY colA ORDER BY colB DESC ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\n\r\nReplace \"UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING\" with \"UNBOUNDED PRECEDING\", and flip the ORDER BY for the window functions first() and last() for ROWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the run-time performance for window function fist() and last() against ROWS UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nLoosen the schema validation logic in `AvroSerializer` to accommodate the situation where a user has provided an explicit schema (via `avroSchema`) and this schema has extra fields which are not present in the Catalyst schema (the DF being written). Specifically, extra _nullable_ fields will be allowed and populated as null. _Required_ fields (non-null) will still be checked for existence.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's common for Avro schemas to evolve in a _compatible_ way (as discussed in Confluent's documentation on [Schema Evolution and Compatibility](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/avro.html); here I refer to `FULL` compatibility). Under such a scenario, new _optional_ fields are added to a schema. Producers are free to include the new field if they so choose, and consumers are free to read the new field if they so choose. It is optional on both sides.\r\n\r\nConsider the following code:\r\n```\r\nval outputSchema = getOutputSchema()\r\ndf.write.format(\"avro\").option(\"avroSchema\", outputSchema).save(...)\r\n```\r\nIf you have a situation where schemas are managed in some centralized repository (e.g. a [schema registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html)), `outputSchema` may update at some point to add a new optional field, without you necessarily initiating any action on your side as a data producer. With the current code, this would cause the producer job to break, because validation would complain that the newly added field is not present in the DataFrame. Really, the producer should be able to continue producing data as normal even without adding the new field to the DataFrame it is writing out, because the field is optional.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, when using the `avroSchema` option on the Avro data source during writes, validation is less strict, and allows for (compatible) schema evolution to be handled more gracefully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests added. We've also been employing this logic internally for a few years, though the implementation was quite different due to recent changes in this area of the code.","created_at":"2021-09-15T22:12:39Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T01:26:09Z","closed_at":"2022-02-18T00:54:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f73b9582ec5b36c409171887be9971c080a8585","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34009/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34009/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34009/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2883904826ada7bc869b05fc3cff0370f8b6d27c","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-34378-avro-serializer-ignore-extra-nullable-fields","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-34378-avro-serializer-ignore-extra-nullable-fields","sha":"2883904826ada7bc869b05fc3cff0370f8b6d27c","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the new syntax introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33954. Namely, users now can specify the index type and name as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyspark.pandas as ps\r\ndef transform(pdf) -> pd.DataFrame[int, [int, int]]:\r\n    pdf['A'] = pdf.id + 1\r\n    return pdf\r\n\r\nps.range(5).koalas.apply_batch(transform)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n   c0  c1\r\n0   0   1\r\n1   1   2\r\n2   2   3\r\n3   3   4\r\n4   4   5\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyspark.pandas as ps\r\ndef transform(pdf) -> pd.DataFrame[(\"index\", int), [(\"a\", int), (\"b\", int)]]:\r\n    pdf['A'] = pdf.id * pdf.id\r\n    return pdf\r\n\r\nps.range(5).koalas.apply_batch(transform)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n       a   b\r\nindex\r\n0      0   0\r\n1      1   1\r\n2      2   4\r\n3      3   9\r\n4      4  16\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, this syntax remains experimental and this is a non-standard way apart from Python standard. We should migrate to proper typing once pandas supports it like `numpy.typing`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe rationale is described in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33954. In order to avoid unnecessary computation for default index or schema inference. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR affects the following APIs:\r\n\r\n- `DataFrame.apply(..., axis=1)`\r\n- `DataFrame.groupby.apply(...)`\r\n- `DataFrame.pandas_on_spark.transform_batch(...)`\r\n- `DataFrame.pandas_on_spark.apply_batch(...)`\r\n\r\nNow they can specify the index type with the new syntax below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDataFrame[index_type, [type, ...]]\r\nDataFrame[(index_name, index_type), [(name, type), ...]]\r\nDataFrame[dtype instance, dtypes instance]\r\nDataFrame[(index_name, index_type), zip(names, types)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and unittests were added.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-15T12:53:59Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:39Z","closed_at":"2021-09-20T01:37:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"98b5cfeeb9f1e509e055c57567ce730322381e82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34007/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34007/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34007/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/682a95aeb9622d7b65aa67e8a76754cc9f1e216d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-36710","ref":"SPARK-36710","sha":"682a95aeb9622d7b65aa67e8a76754cc9f1e216d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe test “ensure continuous stream is being used“ in KafkaContinuousTest quickly checks the actual type of the execution, and stops the query. Stopping the streaming query in continuous mode is done by interrupting query execution thread and join with indefinite timeout.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, started streaming query is going to generate execution plan, including running optimizer. Some parts of SessionState can be built at that time, as they are defined as lazy. The problem is, some of them seem to “swallow” the InterruptedException and let the thread run continuously.\r\n\r\nThat said, the query can’t indicate whether there is a request on stopping query, so the query won’t stop.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes such scenario via ensuring that streaming query has started before the test stops the query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRace-condition could end up with test hang till test framework marks it as timed-out.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2021-09-15T06:55:37Z","updated_at":"2021-09-17T16:00:41Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T13:28:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6f23b322b23a072e35d452282d40d33907727e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

DB Tsai d_tsai@apple.com\r\nCo-Authored-By: Huaxin Gao huaxin_gao@apple.com\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the 2nd PR for V2 Filter support. This PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Add interface SupportsPushDownV2Filters\r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n- refactor `OrcFilters`, `ParquetFilters`, `JacksonParser`, `UnivocityParser` so both V1 file source and V2 file source can use them\r\n- For V2 file source: implement  v2 filter -> parquet/orc filter. csv and Json don't have real filters, but also need to change the current code to have v2 filter -> `JacksonParser`/`UnivocityParser`\r\n- For V1 file source, keep what we currently have: v1 filter -> parquet/orc filter\r\n- We don't need v1filter.toV2 and v2filter.toV1 since we have two separate paths\r\n\r\nThe reasons that we have reached the above conclusion:\r\n- The major motivation to implement V2Filter is to eliminate the unnecessary conversion between Catalyst types and Scala types when using Filters.\r\n- We provide this `SupportsPushDownV2Filters` in this PR so V2 data source (e.g. iceberg) can implement it and use V2 Filters\r\n- There are lots of work to implement v2 filters in the V2 file sources because of the following reasons:\r\n\r\npossible approaches for implementing V2Filter:\r\n1. keep what we have for file source v1: v1 filter -> parquet/orc filter\r\n    file source v2 we will implement v2 filter -> parquet/orc filter\r\n    We don't need v1->v2 and v2->v1\r\n    problem with this approach: there are lots of code duplication\r\n\r\n2.  We will implement v2 filter -> parquet/orc filter\r\n     file source v1: v1 filter -> v2 filter -> parquet/orc filter\r\n     We will need V1 -> V2\r\n     This is the approach I am using in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33973 \r\n     In that PR, I have \r\n     v2 orc： v2 filter -> orc filter\r\n     V1 orc： v1 -> v2 -> orc filter\r\n\r\n     v2 csv: v2->v1, new UnivocityParser\r\n     v1 csv: new UnivocityParser\r\n\r\n    v2 Json: v2->v1, new JacksonParser\r\n    v1 Json: new JacksonParser\r\n\r\n    csv and Json don't have real filters, they just use filter references, should be OK to use either v1 and v2. Easier to use\r\n    v1 because no need to change.\r\n\r\n    I haven't finished parquet yet. The PR doesn't have the parquet V2Filter implementation, but I plan to have \r\n    v2 parquet： v2 filter -> parquet filter\r\n    v1 parquet： v1 -> v2 -> parquet filter\r\n    \r\n    Problem with this approach: \r\n    1. It's not easy to implement V1->V2  because V2 filter have `LiteralValue` and needs type info. We already lost the type information when we convert Expression filer to v1 filter.\r\n    2. parquet is OK\r\n        Use Timestamp as example, parquet filter takes long for timestamp\r\n        v2 parquet： v2 filter -> parquet filter\r\n       timestamp\r\n       Expression （Long） -> v2 filter （LiteralValue  Long）-> parquet filter （Long）\r\n\r\n       V1 parquet： v1 -> v2 -> parquet filter\r\n       timestamp\r\n       Expression （Long） -> v1 filter （timestamp） -> v2 filter （LiteralValue  Long）-> parquet filter （Long）\r\n\r\n       but we have problem for orc because orc filter takes java Timestamp\r\n       v2 orc： v2 filter -> orc filter\r\n       timestamp\r\n       Expression （Long） -> v2 filter （LiteralValue  Long）->  parquet filter （Timestamp）\r\n\r\n       V1 orc： v1 -> v2 -> orc filter\r\n       Expression （Long） ->  v1 filter (timestamp) -> v2 filter （LiteralValue  Long）-> parquet filter （Timestamp）\r\n      This defeats the purpose of implementing v2 filters.\r\n3.  keep what we have for file source v1: v1 filter -> parquet/orc filter\r\n     file source v2: v2 filter -> v1 filter -> parquet/orc filter\r\n     We will need V2 -> V1\r\n     we have similar problem as approach 2. \r\n\r\nSo the conclusion is: approach 1 (keep what we have for file source v1: v1 filter -> parquet/orc filter\r\n    file source v2 we will implement v2 filter -> parquet/orc filter) is better, but there are lots of code duplication. We will need to refactor `OrcFilters`, `ParquetFilters`, `JacksonParser`, `UnivocityParser` so both V1 file source and V2 file source can use them.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe wrong parameter is used in `translateFilter` in the following code\r\n```\r\n      val filters = splitConjunctivePredicates(deleteExpr).map {\r\n        filter => DataSourceStrategy.translateFilter(deleteExpr,\r\n          supportNestedPredicatePushdown = true).getOrElse(\r\n            throw new AnalysisException(s\"Cannot translate expression to source filter: $filter\"))\r\n      }.toArray\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this as an example\r\n```\r\nspark.table(\"source2_t\").writeTo(\"testcat.table_name\").overwrite($\"id1\" === 3 && $\"id2\" === 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code will generate these filters: \r\n```\r\nAnd(EqualTo(id1, 3),EqualTo(id2, 3))  \r\nAnd(EqualTo(id1, 3),EqualTo(id2, 3))\r\n```\r\n\r\n we want to fix the code so it will generate the filters like these: \r\n```\r\nEqualTo(id1, 3)  \r\nEqualTo(id2, 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis problem only exists in 3.1. In 3.2 and 3.3, we have\r\n\r\n```\r\n      val filters = splitConjunctivePredicates(deleteExpr).flatMap { pred =>\r\n        val filter = DataSourceStrategy.translateFilter(pred, supportNestedPredicatePushdown = true)\r\n        if (filter.isEmpty) {\r\n          throw QueryCompilationErrors.cannotTranslateExpressionToSourceFilterError(pred)\r\n        }\r\n        filter\r\n      }.toArray\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfix a bug in the code\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-14T21:15:28Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T21:17:10Z","closed_at":"2021-09-20T20:28:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2fe5ab8f31326c28ad2b4d952191304cc800fe20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1d82af70fe465ccdd75847b07105f33c075f02a9","head":{"label":"huaxingao:spark-36706","ref":"spark-36706","sha":"1d82af70fe465ccdd75847b07105f33c075f02a9","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\noctet_length: caliculate the byte length of strings\r\nbit_length: caliculate the bit length of strings\r\nThose two string related functions are only implemented on SparkSQL, not on Scala, Python and R.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThose functions would be useful for multi-bytes character users, who mainly working with Scala, Python or R.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users can call octet_length/bit_length APIs on Scala(Dataframe), Python, and R.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nJava 8 provides the` java.util.Objects`, this pr it to replace some Guava API usages with the same semantics, the replacement rules are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Preconditions.checkNotNull -> Objects.requireNonNull\r\n\r\n**Guava**\r\n```java\r\npublic static <T> T checkNotNull(T reference,\r\n      @Nullable String errorMessageTemplate,\r\n      @Nullable Object... errorMessageArgs) {\r\n    if (reference == null) {\r\n      // If either of these parameters is null, the right thing happens anyway\r\n      throw new NullPointerException(\r\n          format(errorMessageTemplate, errorMessageArgs));\r\n    }\r\n    return reference;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**java.util.Objects**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static <T> T requireNonNull(T obj, Supplier<String> messageSupplier) {\r\n        if (obj == null)\r\n            throw new NullPointerException(messageSupplier.get());\r\n        return obj;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Objects.hashCode -> j.u.Objects.hash\r\n\r\n**Guava**\r\n```java\r\n  public static int hashCode(@Nullable Object... objects) {\r\n    return java.util.Arrays.hashCode(objects);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**java.util.Objects**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static int hash(Object... values) {\r\n        return java.util.Arrays.hashCode(values);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n3. Objects.equal -> j.u.Objects.equals\r\n\r\n**Guava**\r\n```java\r\n  public static boolean equal(@Nullable Object a, @Nullable Object b) {\r\n    return a == b || (a != null && a.equals(b));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**java.util.Objects**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static boolean equals(Object a, Object b) {\r\n        return (a == b) || (a != null && a.equals(b));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce dependence on Guava API because Spark still use Guava 14.0.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-14T06:31:27Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T07:43:14Z","closed_at":"2021-12-25T00:11:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c4b5d6fa69086b47f8c02c719310f410073d33b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d0a912471047a58b8c40240e74805b69c78b758","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-36750","ref":"SPARK-36750","sha":"7d0a912471047a58b8c40240e74805b69c78b758","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a check in the optimizer rule `CollapseProject` to avoid combining Project with Aggregate when the project list contains one or more correlated scalar subqueries that reference the output of the aggregate. Combining Project with Aggregate can lead to an invalid plan after correlated subquery rewrite. This is because correlated scalar subqueries' references are used as join conditions, which cannot host aggregate expressions.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```sql\r\nselect (select sum(c2) from t where c1 = cast(s as int)) from (select sum(c2) s from t)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [sum(c2)#10L AS scalarsubquery(s)#11L] <--- Aggregate has neither grouping nor aggregate expressions.\r\n+- Project [sum(c2)#10L]\r\n   +- Join LeftOuter, (c1#2 = cast(sum(c2#3) as int))  <--- Aggregate expression in join condition\r\n      :- LocalRelation [c2#3]\r\n      +- Aggregate [c1#2], [sum(c2#3) AS sum(c2)#10L, c1#2]\r\n         +- LocalRelation [c1#2, c2#3]\r\n\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot generate code for expression: sum(input[0, int, false])\r\n```\r\nCurrently, we only allow a correlated scalar subquery in Aggregate if it is also in the grouping expressions.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/079a9c52925818532b57c9cec1ddd31be723885e/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/subquery.scala#L661-L666\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix an existing optimizer issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a new module `hive-shaded` which shades & relocates various dependencies from Hive, including Guava. By this means it also upgrades the Guava version from 14.0.1 to 30.1.1-jre.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark currently use `hive-exec-core` which leaks a lot of dependencies to Spark, in particular Guava. As consequence, Spark is stuck with an ancient Guava version 14.0.1 which also carries CVE issues described in [SPARK-32502](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32502). \r\n\r\nBy creating a shaded module, Spark is able to de-couple from those dependencies leaked by Hive and upgrade to newer versions of Guava. This also allows us to upgrade other dependencies whenever necessary, without having to wait for new Hive releases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. For Spark users who programmatically depending on modules such as `spark-hive`, the Hive dependencies will be replaced by the newly created `hive-shaded` module.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2021-09-14T06:03:39Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T00:12:10Z","closed_at":"2022-01-25T00:12:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"733d80aeda8bbd3b0b928d940ead9215aaef0d26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c2ec1f8122ea9b871a1679571f0b20009be39cb7","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-36676-shade-hive","ref":"SPARK-36676-shade-hive","sha":"c2ec1f8122ea9b871a1679571f0b20009be39cb7","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen running unit test for other change after rebasing master, I found the log becomes very noisy with printing a lot of lines of\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARN org.apache.spark.util.Utils: Push-based shuffle can only be enabled when the application is submittedto run in YARN mode, with external shuffle service enabled, IO encryption disabled, andrelocation of serialized objects supported.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample screenshot for one unit test log:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1677\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-13 at 7 40 14 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4629931/133187285-21fddc6f-8c79-4fd8-89c8-1e7f80e7d88f.png\">\r\n\r\nThen I found https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33976 where we printed the warning even when the push-based shuffle is disabled, which is unnecessary. This would generate a lot of noise for driver log which would make debugging harder.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nReduce noise in driver log.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2021-09-14T02:59:27Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T05:55:09Z","closed_at":"2021-09-14T04:33:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b73004e3396feaccfd637aa914f63fe9cc182c65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33987/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33987/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33987/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d96fdc37f6dca07037eeb9369eab6b067de34034","head":{"label":"c21:log-fix","ref":"log-fix","sha":"d96fdc37f6dca07037eeb9369eab6b067de34034","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates `ExtractEquiJoinKeys` to return an extra field for the join condition with join keys.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSometimes we need to restore the original join condition. Before this PR, we need to build `EqualTo` expressions with the join keys, which is not always the original join condition. E.g. `EqualNullSafe(a, b)` will become `EqualTo(Coalesce(a, lit), Coalesce(b, lit))`. After this PR, we can simply use the new returned field.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes new algorithm to create &  store the constraints.\r\nIt tracks aliases in projection which eliminates the need of pessimistically generating all the permutations of a given constraint. It is also more effective in correctly identifying the filters which can be pruned , apart from minimizing the memory used as compared to the current code. This also has changes to push compound filters if the join condition is on multiple attributes and the constraint comprises of more than 1 attributes of the join conditions.\r\n\r\nPresently I have kept the code which retains the old logic of constraint management along with the new logic. It is controlled by the sql conf property **spark.sql.optimizer.optimizedConstraintPropagation.enabled** which is by default true. Once the PR is approved it would make sense to remove the old code & merge the code of ConstraintSet into ExpressionSet and removing some if else blocks in the Optimizer & the function Optimizer.getAllConstraints and LogicalPlan.getAllValidConstraints.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new logic is as follows:\r\nIn the class ConstraintSet which extends ExpressionSet, we track the aliases , along with the base constraint.\r\nAny constraint which is added to the ConstraintSet is stored in the most canonicalized form (i.e consisting of only those attributes which are part of the output set and NOT the Alias's attribute).\r\n\r\nfor eg consider a hypothetical plan\r\n\r\n>            Filter( z > 10 && a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n>         Projection1 ( a, a as a1, a as a2, b , b as b1, b as b2, c, a +b as z)\r\n                                 |\r\n >                 Filter ( a + b > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n >              base relation (a, b, c, d)\r\n\r\nAt the node Filter the constraint set will just have constraint a + b > 10\r\nAt the Node Projection1 , the constraint set will have\r\nconstraint a + b > 10\r\nand maintain following buffers\r\nbuff1 -> a , a1.attribute, a2. attribute\r\nbuff2 -> b, b1.attribute, b2.attribute\r\nbuff3 -> a + b, z.attribute\r\n\r\nconstraint a + b > 10 is already canonicalized in terms of output attributes.\r\n\r\nNow there are two filters on top of projection1\r\nFilter( z > 10) and Filter ( a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n\r\nTo prune the above two filters, we canonicalize z as a + b ( from the data maintained in the ConstraintSet) & check if the underlying set contains a +b > 10 & so can be pruned.\r\nFor Filter a1 + b2 > 10, we identify the buffer to which a1 & b2 belong to and replace it with 0th elements of the buffer, which will yield a +b > 10, and so filter can be pruned.\r\n\r\nNow suppose there is another Project2 ( a1, a2, b1, b2, z, c)\r\ni.e say attributes a & b are no longer part of OutputSet.\r\n\r\nsuch that the plan looks like:\r\n>         Projection2 ( a1,  a2,  b1,  b2, c,  z)\r\n                                |\r\n>            Filter( z > 10 && a1 + b2 > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n>         Projection1 ( a, a as a1, a as a2, b , b as b1, b as b2, c, a +b as z)\r\n                                 |\r\n >                 Filter ( a + b > 10)\r\n                                 |\r\n >              base relation (a, b, c, d)\r\n\r\n**The idea is that \"as much as possible try to make a constraint survive.**\r\n\r\nSo in Project2 , the atttributes a & b are being eliminated.\r\nwe have a constraint a + b > 10 which is dependent on it.\r\nso in the ConstraintSet of the ProjectP2, we update it such that\r\nconstraint a + b > 10 becomes ----> a1 + b1 > 10\r\n**buff1   ->  a , a1, a2   will become --> a1, a2\r\nbuff2  ->  b , b1, b2.  will become  --> b1, b2\r\nbuff3   ->  a +b , z  will become  -->. a1 + b1 , z**\r\n\r\nThis way by tracking aliases & just storing the canonicalized base constraints we can eliminate the need of pessimistically generating all combination of constraints.\r\n\r\n**This PR also eliminates the need of EqualNullSafe constraints for the alias.\r\nIt also is able to handle the literal boolean constraints.**\r\n\r\n_**For inferring new Filter from constraints**_\r\nwe use following logic\r\nNew Filter = Filter.constraints -- ( Filter.child.constraints ++ Filter.constraints.convertToCanonicalizedIfRequired(Filter.conditions) )\r\nSo the idea is that new filter conditions without redundancy can be obtained by difference of current node's constraints & the child node's constraints & the condition itself properly canonicalized in terms of base attributes which will be part of the output set of filter node.\r\n\r\n_**For inferring new filters for Join push down,**_\r\n we identify all the equality conditions & then the attributes are segregated on the lines of LHS & RHS of joins. So to identify filters for push down on RHS side, we get all equality atttributes of LHS side & ask the ConstraintSet to return all the constraints which are subset of the passed LHS attributes. The LHS attributes are appropriately canonicalized & the ConstraintSet identified.\r\nOnce the constraints are know, we can replace the attributes with the corresponding RHS attributes. This helps in identifying the compound filters for push down & not just single attribute filters.\r\n\r\n_**Below is a description of the changes proposed.**_\r\n\r\nConstraintSet: This is the class which does the tracking of the aliases , stores the constraints in the canonicalized form, updates the constraints using available aliases if any of the attribute comprising constraint is getting eliminated. The contains method of this class is used for filter pruning. It also identifies those constraints which can generated new filters for push down in join nodes.\r\nRest all the changes are just to integrate the new logic as well as retain the old constraints logic.\r\nPls notice that related to tpcds plan stability , I had to add new golden files for q75. The change as such is trivial.\r\npreviously pushed filter was generated as\r\nPushedFilters: [IsNotNull(cr_order_number), IsNotNull(cr_item_sk)]\r\nand with the change it is\r\nPushedFilters: [IsNotNull(cr_item_sk), IsNotNull(cr_order_number)]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. This issue if not fixed can cause OutOfMemory issue or unacceptable query compilation times.\r\nAdded a test **\"plan equivalence with case statements and performance comparison with benefit of more than 10x conservatively\"  in  org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.OptimizedConstraintPropagationSuite**. With this PR the compilation _**time is 247 ms vs 13958 ms without the change**_\r\n2. It is more effective in filter pruning as is evident in some of the tests in org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.OptimizedConstraintPropagationSuite where current code is not able to identify the redundant filter in some cases.\r\n3. It is able to generate a better optimized plan for join queries as it can push compound predicates.\r\n4. The current logic can miss a lot of possible cases of removing redundant predicates, as it fails to take into account if same attribute or its aliases are repeated multiple times in a complex expression.\r\n5. There are cases where some of the optimizer rules involving removal of redundant predicates fail to remove on the basis of constraint data. In some cases the rule works, just by the virtue of previous rules helping it out to cover the inaccuracy. That the ConstraintPropagation rule & its function of removal of redundant filters & addition of new inferred filters is dependent on the working of some of the other unrelated previous optimizer rules is behaving, is indicative of issues.\r\n6. It does away with all the EqualNullSafe constraints as this logic does not need those constraints to be created.\r\n7.  There is atleast one test in existing **ConstraintPropagationSuite** which is missing a IsNotNull constraints because the code incorrectly generated a EqualsNullSafeConstraint instead of EqualTo constraint, when using the existing Constraints code.  With these changes, the test correctly creates an EqualTo constraint, resulting in an inferred IsNotNull constraint\r\n8. It does away with the current combinatorial  logic of evaluation all the constraints can cause compilation to run into hours or cause OOM.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce the 'compute.isin_limit' option, with the default value of 80.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Column.isin(list)` doesn't perform well when the given `list` is large, as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33383.\r\nThus, 'compute.isin_limit' is introduced to constrain the usage of `Column.isin(list)` in the code base.\r\nIf the length of the ‘list’ is above the `'compute.isin_limit'`, broadcast join is used instead for better performance.\r\n\r\n#### Why is the default value 80?\r\nAfter reproducing the benchmark mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33383, \r\n\r\n| length of filtering list | isin time /ms| broadcast DF time / ms|\r\n| :---:   | :-: | :-: |\r\n| 200 | 69411 | 39296 |\r\n| 100 | 43074 | 40087 |\r\n| 80 | 35592 | 40350 |\r\n| 50 | 28134 | 37847 |\r\n\r\nWe may notice when the length of the filtering list <= 80, the `isin` approach performs better than `broadcast DF`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUsers may read/write the value of `'compute.isin_limit'` as follows\r\n```py\r\n>>> ps.get_option('compute.isin_limit')\r\n80\r\n\r\n>>> ps.set_option('compute.isin_limit', 10)\r\n>>> ps.get_option('compute.isin_limit')\r\n10\r\n\r\n>>> ps.set_option('compute.isin_limit', -1)\r\n...\r\nValueError: 'compute.isin_limit' should be greater than or equal to 0.\r\n\r\n>>> ps.reset_option('compute.isin_limit')\r\n>>> ps.get_option('compute.isin_limit')\r\n80\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a perf issue in `SchemaPruning` when a struct has many fields (e.g. >10K fields).\r\nThe root cause is `SchemaPruning.sortLeftFieldsByRight` does N * M order searching.\r\n```\r\n val filteredRightFieldNames = rightStruct.fieldNames\r\n    .filter(name => leftStruct.fieldNames.exists(resolver(_, name))) \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, this PR proposes to use `HashMap` to expect a constant order searching.\r\nThis PR also adds `case _ if left == right => left` to the method as a short-circuit code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix a perf issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. The logic should be identical.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed that the following micro benchmark finishes within a few seconds.\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.SchemaPruning\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\n\r\nvar struct1 = new StructType()\r\n(1 to 50000).foreach { i =>\r\n  struct1 = struct1.add(new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-36456 change to use `JavaUtils. closeQuietly` instead of `IOUtils.closeQuietly`, but there is slightly different from the 2 methods in default behavior: swallowing IOException is same, but the former logs it as ERROR while the latter doesn't log by default. \r\n\r\n`Apache commons-io` community decided to retain the `IOUtils.closeQuietly` method in the [new version](https://github.com/apache/commons-io/blob/75f20dca72656225d0dc8e7c982e40caa9277d42/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java#L465-L467) and removed deprecated annotation,  the change has been released in version 2.11.0.\r\n\r\nSo the change of this pr is to upgrade `Apache commons-io` to 2.11.0 and revert change of SPARK-36456 to maintain original behavior(don't print error log). \r\n\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade `Apache commons-io` to 2.11.0 to use non-deprecated `closeQuietly` API, other changes related to `Apache commons-io are detailed in [commons-io/changes-report](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/changes-report.html#a2.11.0)\r\n \r\n2. Revert change of SPARK-36737 to maintain original `IOUtils.closeQuietly` API behavior(don't print error log). \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to adjust the current overhead of cached relation for DPP.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we calculate if there is benefit of pruning with DPP by simply summing up the size of all scan relations as the overhead. However, for cached relations, the overhead should be different than a non-cached relation. This proposes to use adjusted overhead for cached relation with DPP.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit

In this PR, we have updated the V2 file source to use V2 Filters. ParquetFilter hasn't been updated to use the V2 Filters yet and will be changed in the next PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo eliminate the unnecessary conversion between Catalyst types and Scala types when using Filters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew and existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to ensure that HiveThriftServer2Suites (e.g. `thriftserver.UISeleniumSuite`) stop Thrift JDBC server on exit using shutdown hook.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nNormally, HiveThriftServer2Suites stops Thrift JDBC server via `afterAll` method.\r\nBut, if they are killed by signal (e.g. Ctrl-C), Thrift JDBC server will be remain.\r\n```\r\n$ jps\r\n2792969 SparkSubmit\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nKilled `thriftserver.UISeleniumSuite` by Ctrl-C and confirmed no Thrift JDBC server is remain by

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support a case-insensitive variant of the `LIKE (ALL | ANY | SOME)` expression - `ILIKE`. In this way, Spark's users can match strings to single pattern in the case-insensitive manner. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table ilike_example(subject varchar(20));\r\nspark-sql> insert into ilike_example values\r\n         > ('jane doe'),\r\n         > ('Jane Doe'),\r\n         > ('JANE DOE'),\r\n         > ('John Doe'),\r\n         > ('John Smith');\r\nspark-sql> select *\r\n         > from ilike_example\r\n         > where subject ilike any ('jane%', '%SMITH')\r\n         > order by subject;\r\nJANE DOE\r\nJane Doe\r\nJohn Smith\r\njane doe\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe syntax of `ILIKE` is similar to `LIKE`:\r\n```\r\nstr NOT? ILIKE (ANY | SOME | ALL) (pattern+)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To improve user experience with Spark SQL. No need to use `lower(col_name)` in where clauses.\r\n2. To make migration from other popular DMBSs to Spark SQL easier. DBMSs below support `ilike` in SQL:\r\n    - [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/ilike.html#ilike)\r\n    - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-matching.html)\r\n    - [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/functions-and-operators.html)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, it doesn't. The PR **extends** existing APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By running of expression examples via:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.ExpressionInfoSuite\"\r\n```\r\n2. Added new test to test parsing of `ILIKE`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.ExpressionParserSuite\"\r\n```\r\n3. Via existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z ilike-any.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupporting Netty level logging at the network layer.\r\n\r\nTo configure Netty level logging a `LogHandler` must be added to the channel pipeline.\r\nIn this PR I have introduced a new class `NettyLogger` which is able to construct a log handler depending on the log level:\r\n-  in case of `log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.network.util.NettyLogger=DEBUG`: a custom log handler is  created which does not dump the message contents. This way the log is a bit more compact. Moreover when network level encryption is switched on this level might be sufficient.\r\n- in case of `log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.network.util.NettyLogger=TRACE`: Netty's own log handler is used which dumps the message contents. \r\n- otherwise (when the logger is not TRACE or DEBUG) the pipeline does not contain a log handler (there is no runtime penalty for the default setting but a long running app/service must be restarted along with the new log level to have an effect).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis level of logging proved to be sufficient during debugging some external shuffle related problem. \r\nCompared with the tcpdump this log lines can be more easily correlated with the Spark internal calls.\r\nMoreover the log layout can be configured to contain the thread names that way for a timeout a busy thread could be identified.   \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually.\r\n\r\n#### DEBUG level\r\n\r\n```\r\n╭─attilazsoltpiros@apiros-MBP16 ~/git/attilapiros/spark ‹SPARK-36719*›\r\n╰─$ tail -1 ./conf/log4j.properties\r\nlog4j.logger.org.apache.spark.network.util.NettyLogger=DEBUG\r\n╭─attilazsoltpiros@apiros-MBP16 ~/git/attilapiros/spark ‹SPARK-36719*›\r\n╰─$ ./bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.JavaWordCount --master local\\[8\\]  ./examples/target/original-spark-examples_2.12-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar README.md 2> >(grep NettyLogger) 1> /dev/null\r\n21/09/10 15:24:35 DEBUG NettyLogger: [id: 0xb9d94fcf] REGISTERED\r\n21/09/10 15:24:35 DEBUG NettyLogger: [id: 0xb9d94fcf] CONNECT: /172.30.64.219:61014\r\n21/09/10 15:24:35 DEBUG NettyLogger: [id: 0xb9d94fcf, L:/172.30.64.219:61015 -

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe `CollapseProject` rule can combine adjacent projects and merge the project lists. The key idea behind this rule is that the evaluation of project is relatively expensive, and that expression evaluation is cheap and that the expression duplication caused by this rule is not a problem. This last assumption is, unfortunately, not always true:\r\n- A user can invoke some expensive UDF, this now gets invoked more often than originally intended.\r\n- A projection is very cheap in whole stage code generation. The duplication caused by `CollapseProject` does more harm than good here.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this problem, by only collapsing projects when it does not duplicate expensive expressions. In practice this means an input reference may only be consumed once, or when its evaluation does not incur significant overhead (currently attributes, nested column access, aliases & literals fall in this category).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe have seen multiple complains about `CollapseProject` in the past, due to it may duplicate expensive expressions. The most recent one is https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33903 .\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\na new UT and existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIncorrect order of variable initialization may lead to incorrect behavior, related code: TorrentBroadcast.scala , TorrentBroadCast will get wrong

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes new syntax to specify the index type and name in pandas API on Spark. This is a base work for SPARK-36707.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, users now can use the type hints when typing as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\npd.DataFrame[int, [int, int]]\r\npd.DataFrame[pdf.index.dtype, pdf.dtypes]\r\npd.DataFrame[(\"index\", int), [(\"id\", int), (\"A\", int)]]\r\npd.DataFrame[(pdf.index.name, pdf.index.dtype), zip(pdf.columns, pdf.dtypes)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the types of `[(\"id\", int), (\"A\", int)]` or  `(\"index\", int)` are matched to how you provide a compound NumPy type (see also https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html#introduction).\r\n\r\nTherefore, the syntax will be:\r\n\r\n**Without index:**\r\n\r\n```\r\npd.DataFrame[type, type, ...]\r\npd.DataFrame[name: type, name: type, ...]\r\npd.DataFrame[dtypes instance]\r\npd.DataFrame[zip(names, types)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(New) **With index:**\r\n\r\n```\r\npd.DataFrame[index_type, [type, ...]]\r\npd.DataFrame[(index_name, index_type), [(name, type), ...]]\r\npd.DataFrame[dtype instance, dtypes instance]\r\npd.DataFrame[(index_name, index_type), zip(names, types)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way to specify the type hint for index type - the type hints are converted to return type of pandas UDFs internally. Therefore, we always attach default index which degrade performance:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> def transform(pdf) -> pd.DataFrame[int, int]:\r\n...     pdf['A'] = pdf.id + 1\r\n...     return pdf\r\n...\r\n>>> ks.range(5).koalas.apply_batch(transform)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n   c0  c1\r\n0   0   1\r\n1   1   2\r\n2   2   3\r\n3   3   4\r\n4   4   5\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [default index](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/options.html#default-index-type) (for the first column that looks unnamed) is attached when the type hint is specified. For better performance, we should have a way to work around, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33954#issuecomment-917742920 and [Specify the index column in conversion from Spark DataFrame to Koalas DataFrame](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/best_practices.html#specify-the-index-column-in-conversion-from-spark-dataframe-to-koalas-dataframe).\r\n\r\nNote that this still remains as experimental because Python itself yet doesn't support such kind of typing out of the box. Once pandas completes typing support like NumPy did in `numpy.typing`, we should implement Koalas typing package, and migrate to it with leveraging pandas' typing way.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this PR does not yet affect any user-facing behavior in theory.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-10T07:45:45Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:39Z","closed_at":"2021-09-15T01:13:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"53b0606fed240bc67c385974d7bf7608b2daa9ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23c73c446f6ed569e6d90e4924291a0163a99713","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-36709","ref":"SPARK-36709","sha":"23c73c446f6ed569e6d90e4924291a0163a99713","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Scala 2.13 have the `scala-parallel-collections` dependency only in the `scala-2.13` profile of the pom.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR suggests to work around this by un-commenting the `scala-parallel-collections` dependency when switching to 2.13 using the the `change-scala-version.sh` script.\r\n\r\nI included an upgrade to scala-parallel-collections version 1.0.3, the changes compared to 0.2.0 are minor.\r\n  - removed OSGi metadata\r\n  - renamed some internal inner classes\r\n  - added `Automatic-Module-Name`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAccording to the posts, this solves issues for developers that write unit tests for their applications.\r\n\r\nStephen Coy suggested to use the https://www.mojohaus.org/flatten-maven-plugin. While this sounds like a more principled solution, it is possibly too risky to do at this specific point in time?\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove exception handling in the Platform initialization, where it attempts to assess whether reflection is possible to modify DirectByteBuffer. This can apparently fail in more cases on Java 9+ than are currently handled, whereas Spark can continue without reflection if needed.\r\n\r\nMore detailed comments on the change inline.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis exception seems to be possible and fails startup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException: Unable to make private
