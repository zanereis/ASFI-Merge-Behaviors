change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen DST switched, this test suite broke. This new version of the component and its tests should be functionally equivalent to the original, but with system time properly mocked and frozen for the duration of the test.\r\n\r\nThe test has some odd failures that I haven't yet figured out. All I know about them so far is that when I remove the line `await userEvent.type(searchInput, 'mou', { delay: 10 });` they pass. That line seems important. Since the test passes when the line is removed, I would presume that the test is also not adequately asserting that something actually changed after the user input.\r\n\r\nHelp getting the tests passing would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nRequests should be able to be made without triggering the usual redirect-to-login if a 401 is returned.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we need to have a default action other than a redirect if we get a 401 in the embedded page. This PR also adds code for Embedded so that 401s result in a toast warning instead of a redirect. We may want to change this to something other than a toast in the future, but for now it gets the job done.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore, a 401 resulted in a redirect to our login screen, which since you were already logged in to Preset, redirected to an app-in-app experience, which is pretty confusing. Now you get error messages and this explanation. Less brain-bending.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1212\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-18 at 7 12 07 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/159103163-81e9caaa-4ef6-4441-a320-2e0aa224a4f9.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nPopovers are attached not to the triggers, but rather the overlay on the top of the page. This results in a few problems:\r\n* Pointers are not always accurate and do not point to the field they were triggered by\r\n* when user is scrolling through the control panel, the popover does not move and is floating in random places\r\n\r\nThe solution does two things:\r\n* Blocks scrolling in the panel container while the popup is opened\r\n* Calculates the popover placement based on the trigger location in the screen.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nReports for Dashboards and Charts was a feature that we released in September, due to time constraints, we had a lot of code that was replicated in several places. This PR looks to go through and refactor reports so that the code is more DRY and restful.\r\n\r\nThe major refactor is that all of the api calls, and refreshing, happens within the component now. Before it existed in the Charts header and the dashboard header. We also went through and refactored the redux state to be more generalized.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nReports for Dashboards and Charts was a feature that we released in September, due to time constraints, we had a lot of code that was replicated in several places. This PR looks to go through and refactor reports so that the code is more DRY and restful.\r\n\r\nThe major refactor is that all of the api calls, and refreshing, happens within the component now. Before it existed in the Charts header and the dashboard header. We also went through and refactored the redux state to be more generalized.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nReports for Dashboards and Charts was a feature that we released in September, due to time constraints, we had a lot of code that was replicated in several places. This PR looks to go through and refactor reports so that the code is more DRY and restful. \r\n\r\nThe major refactor is that all of the api calls, and refreshing, happens within the component now. Before it existed in the Charts header and the dashboard header. We also went through and refactored the redux state to be more generalized. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen users are creating a new dataset, if that dataset contains a field with a long, complex data type, users will get an error because the field type is too long. To get around this issue, users must change the field type to JSON. This can currently only be done (in the UI) through the Legacy Datasource Editor. It should be possible to do this through the new dataset editor as well.\r\n\r\nIn the new dataset editor, even if a user wanted to simply change the column's data type from one data type to another, it is not currently possible. To do it, they need to go into the Legacy Datasource Editor, again, this should be possible in the new dataset editor.\r\n\r\nWithin the front-end code, there is a prop for the `ColumnCollectionTable` component named `allowEditDataType`. It is currently always set to false, but if you manually change it to true and reload, you can modify the column's data type in the new dataset editor. So it seems like the implementation was almost complete, it was just never finished off. \r\n\r\nMy solution to this issue includes creating a new feature flag which would allow users to simply modify the config file instead of having to dig into the front-end code to enable this feature. I also created/modified unit tests to make sure that the UI behaves as expected when the flag is either enabled or disabled.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nDataset editor before:\r\n![Feature Flag Disabled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96579982/157870434-1b822e1d-50c7-4368-8feb-5787feb84306.PNG)\r\n\r\nDataset editor after (with feature flag enabled):\r\n![Feature Flag Enabled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96579982/157870500-b8fd52ad-3677-4870-b515-104b3fd0d1ba.PNG)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n**To test that that you can edit the column's data type when feature flag is enabled**\r\n1. Within the config.py file, enable the `ENABLE_EDIT_COLUMN_TYPE` feature flag by setting it to be `True`.\r\n2. When you login to Superset, select `Data > Datasets` from the menu.\r\n3. Once you are on the screen that lists the datasets, edit one by selecting the pencil icon under the 'Actions' column.\r\n4. Select the `Columns` option.\r\n5. For one of the available columns, select the `Toggle Expand` button just to the left of the column name.\r\n6. With the feature flag enabled, you should see a box that allows you to modify the data type of the column.\r\n\r\n**To test that that you cannot edit the column's data type when feature flag is disabled**\r\n1. Within the config.py file, disable the `ENABLE_EDIT_COLUMN_TYPE` feature flag by setting it to be `False`.\r\n2. When you login to Superset, select `Data > Datasets` from the menu.\r\n3. Once you are on the screen that lists the datasets, edit one by selecting the pencil icon under the 'Actions' column.\r\n4. Select the `Columns` option.\r\n5. For one of the available columns, select the `Toggle Expand` button just to the left of the column name.\r\n6. With the feature flag disabled, you should no longer see a box that allows you to modify the data type of the column.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

Summary\r\nSuperset uses Pandas Dataframe for query results processing. Now, these Dataframe between different [Operators](https://github.com/apache/superset/tree/master/superset/utils/pandas_postprocessing) only support 1-dimensional Dataframe. This has caused confusion in some calculations. This PR introduces MultiIndex Dataframe for Operators. This is useful for simplifying calculations.\r\n\r\n### Current PostProcessing\r\nTypical PostProcessing Operators are used in [time-series charts](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/e3e03d202db959d708acbfe8a25a50dddc85fa7f/superset-frontend/plugins/plugin-chart-echarts/src/Timeseries/buildQuery.ts#L73) for getting queries. e.g.:\r\n```\r\n        post_processing: [\r\n          resampleOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n          timeCompareOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n          sortOperator(formData, { ...baseQueryObject, is_timeseries: true }),\r\n          pivotOperatorInRuntime,\r\n          rollingWindowOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n          contributionOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n          prophetOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n        ],\r\n```\r\nWe face these challenges for existing designs: \r\n1. Such query can't be adapted to both rolling calculation and time compared calculation. In the other words, `rollingWindowOperator` __should__ before `timeCompareOperator`. \r\n2. We also need to consider how to face series in Dataframe. [for example](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/e3e03d202db959d708acbfe8a25a50dddc85fa7f/superset/utils/pandas_postprocessing/resample.py#L30), in the `resample.py`. We need to \"flat\" multidimensional Dataframe to adapt this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### After Changed\r\nThe new operators support calculate on multidimensional Dataframe. So, operators in `QueryObject` can change its position at will. eg:\r\n```\r\n        post_processing: [\r\n          pivotOperatorInRuntime,\r\n          resampleOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n          rollingWindowOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n          timeCompareOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n          flatOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n          contributionOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n          prophetOperator(formData, baseQueryObject),\r\n        ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, The `compare()` [operator](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/818eb02fc045100b02208173f4d889e309fd323d/superset/utils/pandas_postprocessing/compare.py) supports the Dataframe shape like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                   count_metric    sum_metric\r\n    country              UK US         UK US\r\n    dttm\r\n    2019-01-01            1  2          5  6\r\n    2019-01-02            3  4          7  8\r\n```\r\n\r\nadding new operator `flat.py`, this new operator will transform the multidimensional dataframe to flatten dataframe.\r\n\r\nThe full examples:\r\n```\r\n    pivot_df = pp.pivot(\r\n        df=multiple_metrics_df,\r\n        index=[\"dttm\"],\r\n        columns=[\"country\"],\r\n        aggregates={\r\n            \"sum_metric\": {\"operator\":

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR moves the boolean enablement of the JS controls (i.e. custom tooltips in the DeckGL viz) from app configuration to feature flags. Two main reasons: \r\n1) To better support deployments who manage feature flags on the fly... this seems more fitting in that area of configuration\r\n2) To move the feature (with its self-admitted risks, and unknown level of community adoption) to the Feature Flag lifecycle, wherein we may more systematically either secure the feature's development and enablement, or deprecate it and replace it with a newer feature (e.g. jinja/markdown tooltips).\r\n\r\nThis is considered a breaking change since certain deployments may rely on enabling/disabling this feature, and they may have to adapt their configuration to set it in a new place.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTurn on the flag, and see that it works! We can (and shall!) do this on an ephemeral environment on this PR.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rebase of the original https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14768 PR created by @akedrou. The original modifications made to the code were kept intact, however, to ensure that the feature works on master, I had to make some minor modifications to specific files. I also made some edits/additions based on the feedback that was given on the original PR.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Original PR's Summary:**\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new per-database configuration option to disable data preview queries in SQL Lab. This setting is exposed in the database API as disable_preview_data. I decided to add the feature to the database API and pass the database as a parameter to addTable rather than adding a database setting into a table API response (the proposed solution in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14726). As a result, the data preview query was moved up to addTable as well. To my eye that looks cleaner since I don't think that previewing data should be a part of \"table metadata\" anyway.\r\n\r\nThere is no UI change, though the UX changes when data preview is disabled to not show the data preview pane (or results) when getting table metadata.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The original PR mentions that there is no UI change, this is no longer the case as there is now a new checkbox in the \"Advanced>SQL Lab\" section of a database settings page.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n**To test that the SQL Lab data preview is disabled when the checkbox is selected**\r\n1. In the database configuration settings, select \"Disable SQL Lab data preview queries\" under \"Advanced>SQL Lab\".\r\n2. In SQL Editor, select the database you have configured, and then any schema or table.\r\n        - Alternately, trigger metadata to load from the editor textbox itself.\r\n4. Table metadata should load as normal, but no data preview query should run.\r\n\r\n**To test that the SQL Lab data preview works when the checkbox is not selected**\r\n1. In the database configuration settings, unselect \"Disable SQL Lab data preview queries\" under \"Advanced>SQL Lab\".\r\n2. In SQL Editor, select the database you have configured, and then any schema or table.\r\n        - Alternately, trigger metadata to load from the editor textbox itself.\r\n3. Table metadata should load as normal, and a data preview query should run.\r\n\r\n**You can also run the following tests to make sure they still pass after the code modifications:**\r\n\r\n`npm test ./src/components/DatabaseSelector/DatabaseSelector.test.tsx`\r\n`npm test ./src/SqlLab/actions/sqlLab.test.js`\r\n`npm test ./src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditor/SqlEditor.test.jsx`\r\n`npm test ./src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditorLeftBar/SqlEditorLeftBar.test.jsx`\r\n\r\n`tox -e py38 -- tests/integration_tests/core_tests.py`\r\n`tox -e py38 -- tests/integration_tests/databases/api_tests.py`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes an error `Cannot read properties of null` when 1 of native filter's options was `null`.\r\nThe problem was that in `src/components/Select/utils.ts::getValue` function we tried to access `option.value` if option was an object. However, `typeof null === \"object\"`, so that resulted in an error if 1 of the options was null.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/157644122-2d90612e-c484-4d36-ad2e-64653c0b18a7.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/157644001-6f677efe-8a4c-4482-8832-a1fad13f1a41.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nWhen query returned no results, we were showing a large empty state component in chart container on the dashboard, regardless of container's size. If the container was small, the empty state was overflowing. This PR fixes that behaviour by replacing large empty state with a small one if chart's width is smaller than 300px or if chart's height is smaller than 220px.\r\nAlso, I removed chart empty state's description if it's displayed on the dashboard - the description will be displayed only on Explore page.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/157640833-1807023c-d423-4a4d-90cc-247c17f5036e.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1791\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/157640724-dafda228-4379-4e05-ad3b-9e14d11135be.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard with large and small charts\r\n2. Add a filter that filters out all results\r\n3. Verify that the empty state is not overflowing in any chart\r\n4. Verify that the empty state has only image and title\r\n5. Click \"View chart in Explore\"\r\n6. Verify that empty state has an image, title and description\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEncountered a broken unit test in `TimezoneSelector` after making changes in #19085 , found some room for improvements so I refactored this component a little: simplified the timezone overriding logics and made the unit tests more complete. See comments for details.\r\n\r\nAs the changes are quite significant and the component itself is small, it may be easier to review the diff in split view.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"324\" alt=\"Xnip2022-03-09_17-32-11\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/157569467-106b9b01-a3d1-4cb3-9759-11e0b1f544d9.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nNo visual changes\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTest places where timezone selector is used.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAfter applying a more sensible search sort comparator in #18856 , I realized that the new sorting isn't applied to non-async select options in Explore controls. This is because they are using a default sort comparator added to Explore's Select control in #17638, which was trying to address the issue where options are unnecessarily sorted by labels for numeric values.\r\n\r\nIn reality, we can get away with the problem raised in #17638 by simply not messing with the input option orders when users are not searching. The options have two sorted orders:\r\n1. When users are not searching, they should be arranged in their logical order---alphabetical for strings and order by value for numbers, or keeping the original orders in the table schema for table columns. This is better managed by options providers themselves (either a parent component or an async API).\r\n2. When users are searching, we should always sort the options based on a search matching score on option labels. For numbers, as long as we sort startsWith match to the top, they will be correctly sorted even if we sort by label strings.\r\n\r\nBy preserving the original order of input `options`, we avoid having to add custom sorters in most cases. When users are not searching, we just use whatever orders options provider pass in; when users are searching, we apply the same match sort algorithm for maximum consistency. Sorting the unfiltered options list only makes sense when merge async results from different search queries or multiple pages where the orders of the options in the merged list aren't guaranteed. For this case, we can introduce a `mergeData` config function to indicate how data should be merged in the frontend---the order of the merged data will still be preserved when the search string is empty.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the Select component to not reorder the predefined `options` list when in non-async mode, which is also the original behavior of the now deprecated Select component based on react-select.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nSearch sort exact match and starts with first isn't applied to countries select in Country

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new permanent link functionality that makes it possible to persist Dashboard and Explore state in the metadata database. The state is persisted in a new metadata table called `key_value`, which is able to store pickleable binary objects (can be used in the future for other resources, too). The new permalinks look as follows:\r\n- Dashboard: `http://host/superset/dashboard/p/<key>/`\r\n- Explore: `http://host/superset/explore/p/<key>/`\r\n\r\nThe dashboard state is a `dict` with the following fields:\r\n- `filterState`: native filter state\r\n- `hash` (optional): the anchor (used for direct links to charts/tabs)\r\n- `urlParams` (optional): any URL params that are active, excluding the reserved URL params like `native_filter_key` etc. This is also where filter box state is persisted. Note that these are stored as a list of key-value tuples to support having multiple same keys (not currently supported by the chart data API but implemented like this for future proofing)\r\n\r\nThe Explore state is also a `dict` with the following fields:\r\n- `formData` the chart form data\r\n- `urlParams` (optional): any URL params that are active, excluding the reserved URL params like `form_data_key`, `slice_id` etc. (same format as in the dashboard state)\r\n\r\nThe benefits compared to the deprecated `shorturl` functionality:\r\n- Leverages existing resource security mechanism: if you don't have access to a chart/dashboard, you are also not able to view permalink state for those charts/dashboards\r\n- Uses UUID-based keys by default to make permalinks unguessable. However, where needed, numeric serial keys (similar to the legacy shorturl keys) can be used by flipping a config flag. Do note, however, that changing this setting will cause old links to stop working, i.e. it's not possible to retrieve permalink state based by its UUID key if the feature has been configured to work with the serial id and vice versa.\r\n- Is not restricted by the URL length limitations that affects shorturls (however, Filter Box state is still subject to URL overflows).\r\n\r\nNotice that old shorturls will still work like before - but links created after this will be based on the new permalink feature.\r\n\r\nDetailed list of changes:\r\n- Rename current `key_value` package to `temporary_cache` to better reflect the ephemeral nature of the state (not guaranteed to be persisted)\r\n- Add new `key_value` table to metadata database along with relevant commands for adding, updating, getting and deleting key-value pairs\r\n- Add `permalink` endpoints (POST and GET) to both Explore and Dashboard that leverage the new `key_value` store\r\n- Add `PERMALINK_KEY_TYPE` to `config.py` which makes it possible to switch between serial and UUID based keys (UUID = default)\r\n- fully support persisting filter box state and url parameters in permalink state (this was currently mostly broken)\r\n- remove old shorturl creation functionality from frontend and backend\r\n- Migrate all permalink buttons to new feature:\r\n  - Explore action buttons (above chart): \"Copy permalink to clipboard\" and \"Share permalink by email\" \r\n  - Explore embed iframe button (above chart): link now references a permalink\r\n  - Dashboard context menu: \"Copy permalink to clipboard\" and \"Share permalink by email\"\r\n  - Dashboard chart context menu: \"Copy permalink to clipboard\" and \"Share permalink by email\" \r\n  - Dashboard tab anchor link\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/157868216-4ce210b1-137b-4fa0-b9b3-39ddf67bc98d.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Explore a dataset, add a metric/columns to a few controls and share a permalink both via clipboard and email. Change control values and verify that changes don't change the state in the previously shared permalink. Bonus: create a chart with Jinja that uses `url_param` and make sure URL params are correctly persisted in permalinks.\r\n2. Click the Embed code button and make sure the link works\r\n3. Save the chart and ensure sharing works similar to above\r\n4. Go to a dashboard with native filters and tabs, select a few filters and share the dashboard from the context menu.\r\n5. Click on the anchor button next to a tab and make sure both the link and email message works\r\n6. Click on a chart context menu and make sure both link and email message works\r\n7. Create a dashboard with a filter box and a chart, apply a filter on the filter box and make sure shared permalinks open with the predefined filters\r\n8. Bonus: add a chart with Jinja that references a `url_param` and make sure the chart renders correctly 1) in the dashboard after creating a permalink 2) in the explore view after creating a permalink to the chart.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [x] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\nFor performance reasons, when a dashboard loads, native filters requests are delayed until chart requests were triggered. However, that's not the case when user clicks \"Refresh dashboard\" button. This PR fixes that issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nIn the `Network` panel on the right you can see the requests sent after clicking \"Refresh dashboard\". The ones that just say `data` are native filter requests. The other ones are chart requests. The goal was to make sure that all native filter requests were made after chart requests\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/157459238-e4b71f78-4f01-45e3-bcf7-47227d48ff9d.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/157458952-e44a2ab9-2d0b-4444-8e7c-0e82767077ec.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard with multiple charts and native filters\r\n2. Open Chrome dev tools network tab\r\n3. Click \"Refresh dashboard\"\r\n4.

creating a chart with `show total` flag on, `group by` and `sort by`, we used to get error response from the server, because as you can see from the below screenshot, the second query was invalid.\r\n\r\nSo, I removed `sort by` and `desc` from the extra query (which is being created when we flag show total on).

SUMMARY\r\nThe Pivot Table conditional formatting was not updating the metric list when changes where made.\r\nThe problem is that the conditional formatting only executed the `mapStateToProps` function once, on startup, and thus, changing the information on the metrics without triggering a rerender in any other way caused the panel to have obsolete data.\r\n\r\nThis pointed to a brittle way the panel were recomputing their properties: It was only done if the number of arguments of the `mapStateToProps` equals to three.\r\nInstead, this PR adds a function `shouldMapStateToProps` to the panel config interface to allow controls to request updates if they need to.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Create a pivot table\r\n2. Add one metric\r\n3. In Customize, select that metric for conditional formatting\r\n4. Add a second metric\r\n5. Try to select the metric in conditional formatting\r\n\r\nEnsure the second added metric displays in the conditional formatting panel.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nFixes dataset search when creating a chart. Previously, when we typed \"b\" for example, the option \"channels\" was appearing in the results. That happened because the value for the dataset is in the form \"table_<id>\" and since the default `optionFilterProps` is `['label', 'value']`, the \"b\" was being matched with the \"b\" in \"table\". This PR fixes this by introducing an `id` prop and configuring `optionFilterProps`. Now the search is correct and we preserve the ability to search by id.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR improves the performance of dashboards with complex structure (multiple tabs, many levels of nesting, many charts, native filters).\r\nThe main culprit of poor performance was a function used for finding charts in filter's scope. `getChartIdsInFilterScope` was written in a very suboptimal way, which drastically slowed down loading charts - which was especially noticeable when opening a dashboard or switching tabs.\r\nI've rewritten that function and made a few other improvements, which resulted in a much smoother experience.\r\nThe scope of the changes in this PR is related only to native filters and cross filters. Performance issues related to filter box were not addressed, as the filter box will soon be deprecated in favor of native filters.\r\n\r\nThe tests were performed on a dashboard with 100+ charts, 70+ tabs, up to 4 levels of nested tabs, up to 10 charts in a single tab, 9 native filters.\r\n\r\nDashboard used for testing: [dashboard_export_20220309T112451.zip](https://github.com/apache/superset/files/8213872/dashboard_export_20220309T112451.zip)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/157247412-84be2244-b26c-48b4-9eb4-4005ffc4ebcd.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/157247602-359b5bab-e857-466f-a6d4-dfc8422fcd48.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Verify that building dashboards works like before\r\n2. Verify that applying native filters works like before\r\n3. Verify that applying cross filters works like before\r\n4. Verify that applying filters from filter box works like before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed the problem that JAVASCRIPT TOOLTIP GENERATOR of Deck.gl is not working.\r\n\r\nI installed `vm-browserify` and specified it in `webpack.config.js`.\r\nBecause Webpack 5 no longer polyfills and `vm` module is used at `sandboxedEval` function defined `superset/superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-preset-chart-deckgl/src/utils/sandbox.js`.\r\n\r\n> Webpack 5 no longer polyfills Node.js core modules automatically which means if you use them in your code running in browsers or alike, you will have to install compatible modules from npm and include them yourself.\r\n> https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces 2 helper functions for RLS:\r\n\r\n- `has_table_query(statement: Statement) -> bool:`, which analyzes a SQL statement parsed by`sqlparse` and returns `True` if it queries a table (either in a `FROM` or `JOIN`).\r\n- `insert_rls(token_list: TokenList, table: str, rls: TokenList) -> TokenList:`, which given a parsed statement (or token list), a table name, and a parsed RLS expression, will reformat the query so that the RLS is present in any queries or subqueries referencing the table.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we have the RLS expression `id=42` on the table `my_table` we could do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> statement = sqlparse.parse('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_table')[0]\r\n>>> has_table_query(statement)\r\nTrue\r\n>>> rls = sqlparse.parse('id=42')[0]\r\n>>> print(insert_rls(statement, 'my_table', rls)\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_table WHERE my_table.id=42\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nI added unit tests covering different cases:\r\n\r\n- Regular queries\r\n- Nested queries\r\n- Joins\r\n- Union\r\n- Fully qualified table names (eg, `schema.table_name`)\r\n- RLS already in the SQL\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the row count of a query executed in the SQL Lab is greater than the `DISPLAY_MAX_ROW` config, the row count shows incorrectly in the Query History tab.\r\n\r\nThe expected result is the row count to show the actual number of rows queried, regardless of the `DISPLAY_MAX_ROW` config, since that's only used to limit the result display.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

(`SELECT country_name from wb_health_population` for example) with more than 10k rows \r\n* Run another query (a expensive one, like `SELECT * from wb_health_population`)\r\n* Refresh the page while the previous query is executing\r\n* Switch to the query history tab in SQL Lab\r\n\r\nIt might be needed to try this a couple of times to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR solves the problem that form data will not be cleared when hiding a control via dynamic controls (e.g. orderBy). These are what I did:\r\n- Make a control whose visibility is `false` doesn't return null in parent component rendering,  but returns null in child component and resets the control value in child component `useEffect`.\r\n- Since it still renders in component trees and we need to make it behave the same as `HiddenControl` (don't be counted and don't display)\r\n- Clean unused code\r\n- Add more tests for this part\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/156961016-9d8dd5b8-2a5f-489d-9c77-84931290f38c.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### after\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/156961432-3d09802e-1c01-43f8-8df2-9b465ed0a4e5.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Create a Timeseries chart\r\n- Add one METRIC\r\n- Add one SORT BY\r\n- Uncheck SORT DESCENDING\r\n- Run query\r\n- Remove SORT BY\r\n-

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe migration from SIP-68 was calling `create_engine` just to get the dialect associated with a given database. This required reimplementing many methods in the custom `Database` class defined in the migration, since it requires doing user impersonation, mutating the connection string, and much more. This was failing for BigQuery because it was not finding the credentials:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngoogle.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: Could not automatically determine credentials. Please set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS or explicitly create credentials and re-run the application. For more information, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started\r\n```\r\n\r\nTurns out there's a simpler way of getting the dialect associated with a database that doesn't require `create_engine`. I implemented it in this PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR deletes the `src/common/components` folder. To do that, it reorganizes the exporting/importing of Ant Design components by clearly separating overridden components from the directed imported ones. This will allow us to review these components in the future to better support themes. It also adds comments to the `src/components/index.ts` file to steer the developers in the right direction when interacting with Ant Design.\r\n\r\nThis work is part of [SIP-61](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13632)\r\n\r\nPS: It's not the objective of this PR to check for all direct imports of Ant Design in the components. This will probably be made in follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Execute all tests\r\n2 - All tests should pass\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature
