Description\r\n\r\nFixes the order in which the row's results are finalized in the `GroupByPostShuffleFrameProcessor`. This fixes the bug which prevents the queries containing a `HAVING` clause with complex aggregators from executing.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT count(distinct __time)\r\nFROM foo\r\nGROUP BY c1\r\nHAVING count(distinct __time) > 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bug arises because `DimFilterHavingSpec` expects the unfinalized rows to check if the row passes the `HAVING` clause (it finalizes it internally), however in the `GroupByPostShuffleFrameProcessor`, we finalize the rows before that. \r\n\r\n###### NOTE \r\nThis should also allow the following test cases to pass, however, they are not enabled due to the null handling discrepancy in the MSQ test cases:\r\n```\r\nCalciteQueryTest#testHavingOnApproximateCountDistinct()\r\nCalciteQueryTest#testHavingOnExactCountDistinct\r\n```\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\nThis PR reverts `NestedDataColumnIndexer`, `NestedDataColumnMerger`, `NestedDataColumnSerializer` to their version pre #13803 behavior (v4) for backwards compatibility in favor of splitting the new functionality into a new `\"auto\"` dimension schema type to more accurately reflect the new behavior that this PR adds.\r\n\r\nThis new 'auto type' indexer, merger, and an associated family of serializers is the next logical iteration of the nested column stuff. Essentially this is an automatic type column indexer that produces the most appropriate column for the given inputs, making either `STRING`, `ARRAY<STRING>`, `LONG`, `ARRAY<LONG>`, `DOUBLE`, `ARRAY<DOUBLE>`, or `COMPLEX<json>` columns, all sharing a common 'nested' format that allows segment merging to occur smoothly regardless of which physical format the column was written with. \r\n\r\nTo accompany this, a new `ColumnFormat` interface has been defined to separate physical storage format from logical type. `ColumnFormat` is now used instead of `ColumnCapabilities` to get column handlers for segment creation. This allows both the v4 legacy columns and the new common format nested columns to both be able to map to the `COMPLEX<json>`\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug in `RoaringBitmapSerdeFactory`, where if anything actually ever wrote out an empty bitmap using `toBytes` and then later tried to read it it would fail (the nerve!)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nA new \"auto\" type column schema and indexer has been added to native ingestion as the next logical iteration of the nested column functionality. This automatic type column indexer that produces the most appropriate column for the given inputs, producing either `STRING`, `ARRAY<STRING>`, `LONG`, `ARRAY<LONG>`, `DOUBLE`, `ARRAY<DOUBLE>`, or `COMPLEX<json>` columns, all sharing a common 'nested' format.\r\n\r\nAll columns produced by 'auto' have indexes to aid in fast filtering (unlike classic `LONG` and `DOUBLE` columns) and use cardinality based thresholds to attempt to only utilize these indexes when it is likely to actually speed up the query (unlike classic `STRING` columns).\r\n\r\n`COMPLEX<json>` columns produced by this 'auto' indexer store arrays of simple scalar types differently than their 'json' (v4) counterparts, storing them as `ARRAY` typed columns. This means that the `JSON_VALUE` function can now extract entire arrays, e.g. `JSON_VALUE(nested, '$.array' RETURNING BIGINT ARRAY)`. There is no change with how arrays of complex objects are stored at this time.\r\n\r\nThis improvement also adds a completely new functionality to Druid, `ARRAY` typed columns, which unlike classic multi-value `STRING` columns behave with `ARRAY` semantics. These columns can currently only be created via the 'auto' type indexer when all values are an arrays with the same type of elements.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ColumnFormat`\r\n * a bunch of other stuff\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

a set of unit tests for the recently-added `druidapi` Python library used in notebooks and by those of us who like to use Jupyter notebooks for debugging. The tests are based on the Python `unittest` framework which is roughly similar to the Java JUnit framework. The tests are a bit light, but they do cover much of the existing functionality. It should be easy to add additional tests, such as for the basic security method in an adjacent PR.

PR adds a complete set of Basic security functions to the Python `druidapi`. These functions are handy for setting up security, inspecting the security setup, and learning the nuances of the basic security system. They would make a fine foundation for Basic security tutorial notebook. If we did such a notebook:\r\n\r\n* Emphasize that users are defined twice: once in the authorizer, again in the authenticator.\r\n* The many config settings that have to be done just right.\r\n* The complexities of SQL security: sometimes one needs multiple permissions.\r\n\r\nSince the Druid console doesn't provide tools to set up basic security, doing it via Python is a handy way to get started until a user defines a more production-grade integration with an external system.\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Define a coordinator-specific client, using the admin user\r\ncoord = druidapi.jupyter_client('http://localhost:8081', auth=('admin', 'pwd'))\r\n# Create a basic auth client for your authenticator and authorizer:\r\nac = coord.basic_security('myAuthorizer', 'myAuthenticator')\r\n\r\n# Get information\r\n# List users\r\nac.users()\r\n# List roles\r\nac.users()\r\n# List roles for a user\r\nac.authorization_user('alice')\r\n# List permissions for a role\r\nac.role_permissions('aliceRole')\r\n\r\n# Create user\r\nac.add_user('fred', 'pwd')\r\n# Create role\r\nac.add_role('myRole')\r\n# Grant permissions to a role\r\nperms = [ac.resource_action(consts.DATASOURCE_RESOURCE, 'foo', consts.READ_ACTION)]\r\nac.set_role_permissions('myRole', perms)\r\n# Assign a role to a user\r\nac.assign_role_to_user('myRole', 'fred')\r\n\r\n# \"Log in\" as the new user\r\nfred = druidapi.jupyter_client('http://localhost:8888', auth=('fred', 'pwd'))\r\n# Perform operations as the user.\r\nfred.sql.sql('SELECT * FROM foo LIMIT 10')\r\n\r\n# Drop user\r\nac.drop_user('fred')\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nSee the description.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-31T20:50:29Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T17:58:05Z","closed_at":"2023-04-11T17:58:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b6877f7783295e59364bd6a56a27ee7f69280b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

is the 3rd take at creating a unified Exception in the DruidException.  Given that I had input on the previous two attempts, I figured I'd take the next stab at offering something that matches the input that I had provided.\r\n\r\n`DruidException` and `ErrorResponse` have class level javadoc discussing how it's all setup and why, so I would recommend starting there.  Then branch out and look at some of the points where DruidExceptions are created (DruidPlanner and various of the other places).\r\n\r\nThere is a compatibility layer in this PR that tries to continue mimicing the old way that QueryException was getting serialized out, but the current PR treats that as best-effort.  Specifically, anything that started its life as a DruidException will be an \"unknown\" error type when serialized back as a QueryException.  The error message should make it through, but the type characterization will be different.  This should only happen in the middle of roll-forward/roll-back processes, so it will be short-lived and, given that it preserves the message, is hopefully a decent compromise.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as I was adjusting tests, I got tired of the SQL tests taking roughly 5 minutes to run through the entire suite, so I looked into why it was doing that and through moving some initialization around and fixing some time-based async tests to be based on latches instead, was able to get that timing down to ~1.5 minutes, so some of those changes are mixed in here as well.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nA new unified exception for surfacing errors to users has been introduced.  It is partially compatible with the old way of reporting error messages, response codes remain the same, all fields that previously existed on the response will continue to exist and be populated, including the errorMessage.  But some error messages have changed to be more consumable by humans and some cases will have the message restructured.  Any clients that are actively looking at the error message to make decisions on what to do should explore the changes to the error messages that they care about, but if all a client looks at is the response code, there should be no impact.  \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#13837.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis change allows for input source type security in the native task layer.\r\n\r\nTo enable this feature, the user must set the following property to true:\r\n\r\n`druid.auth.enableInputSourceSecurity=true`\r\n\r\nThe default value for this property is false, which will continue the existing functionality of needing authorization to write to the respective datasource.\r\n\r\nWhen this config is enabled, the users will be required to be authorized for the following resource action, in addition to write permission on the respective datasource.\r\n\r\n`new ResourceAction(new Resource(ResourceType.EXTERNAL, {INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}, Action.READ`\r\n\r\nwhere `{INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}` is the type of the input source being used;, http, inline, s3, etc..\r\n\r\nOnly tasks that provide a non-default implementation of the `getInputSourceResources` method can be submitted when config `druid.auth.enableInputSourceSecurity=true` is set. Otherwise, a 400 error will be thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-30T20:18:21Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T22:58:56Z","closed_at":"2023-04-06T17:13:09Z","merged_at":"2023-04-06T17:13:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c0221375c8dfa4c3509eb9e1b6864941dfe84c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/50","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/50","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/50/labels","id":9225391,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4AjMSv","number":50,"title":"26.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":458,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-30T06:36:07Z","updated_at":"2023-05-24T05:28:09Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2023-05-24T05:28:09Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/14003/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/14003/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/14003/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/8381968063c0a3be38cbe283a1a4f76e2b473ea9","head":{"label":"zachjsh:input-source-security-native","ref":"input-source-security-native","sha":"8381968063c0a3be38cbe283a1a4f76e2b473ea9","user":{"login":"zachjsh","id":6694788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTQ3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6694788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh","html_url":"https://github.com/zachjsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":236556952,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY1NTY5NTI=","name":"druid","full_name":"zachjsh/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zachjsh","id":6694788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTQ3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6694788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh","html_url":"https://github.com/zachjsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachjsh/orgs","repos_url":"

Description\r\nWhile working on some other stuff I noticed that we were doing something when loading segments which results in some extra heap usage storing redundant stuff we don't really need. Specifically, the changes in #12279 causes us to make a combined column and dimension list in the form of `Indexed` to pass to the `SimpleQueryableIndex`, which it was doing prior to this PR with https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/IndexIO.java#L648 `GenericIndexed.fromIterable` which is going to make new heap bytebuffers of the column and dimension lists. The columns `Indexed` is thrown away basically, but the dimensions list is kept around forever.\r\n\r\nWe actually already have to have all of these column names on heap, and are already interning them via the `FileSmooshMapper` https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/java/util/common/io/smoosh/SmooshedFileMapper.java#L88 which does so whenever it reads `meta.smoosh` to get the internal file list of a smoosh. There is an internal file as the entry point for every column name, so if we re-use this interner for the map of `ColumnHolder` suppliers as well as to back the `Indexed<String>` for the dimension list then we can save some heap.\r\n\r\nWith my laptop test cluster of ~5k segments it reduces the heap footprint by ~20MB\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 8 27 59 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/228732099-bcea909c-c400-4d42-b6db-c5ec2033af19.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 8 28 22 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/228732186-f4c6f7a5-1718-4edb-b3dc-28bd402166c7.png)\r\n\r\nLooking specifically at strings, we now have about 1/3 as many on heap (from the map of ColumnHolder suppliers), not counting all of the heap bytebuffers which were backing the dimensions lists.\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 8 38 54 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/228732287-5166a7c4-3342-4cee-8240-6ba32ba51f13.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-03-29 at 8 39 00 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/228732298-0dfc568e-0d3f-488d-9ae9-af19de3dc033.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nCompletely unrelated, this PR also fixes a bug with native expression type coercion with complex types. The added test would fail where it would return \"unknown complex\" sometimes when using the `ExpressionTypeCoercion.operator` method. I guess I could have made it its own PR, but both things were small...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-30T04:50:02Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T22:59:22Z","closed_at":"2023-03-31T20:53:22Z","merged_at":"2023-03-31T20:53:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"518698a9520a52bfb0cc1118f53df536f09aaf44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nWith the KubernetesTaskRunner, if a task is manually shutdown via the web console while running or the corresponding k8s job is manually deleted, the thread responsible for overseeing the task gets stuck in a loop because the fabric8 client sends one event to it that the job is null when the job is deleted, but this doesn't pass the condition.\r\n\r\nThis means that the thread is stuck waiting on a fabric8 event (the job being successful) that will never come up until maxTaskDuration (default 4 hours). If a user of the extension is trying to use a limited taskqueue maxSize, this can cause problems as the k8s executor pool is unable to pick up additional tasks (since threads are stuck waiting on the old tasks that have already been deleted).\r\n\r\nAn alternative method might be to have the shutdown method in the K8s Task runner cancel running futures so they don't get stuck when the job is deleted, but this would not address the situation where a k8s job is manually deleted.\r\n\r\n#### Release notes\r\nFix a bug with hanging threads in the K8s Task Scheduler\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\nUpdate waitForJobCompletion to exit out with a failed status if the job has been deleted. This function is only called after a job has been confirmed to have been launched (either right after launchJobAndWaitForStart has been called or after a job that is already running has been run again), so there should be no issues with race conditions here.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n#13988 made a mistake, the default needs to be v0 because old tasks on new workers would have null for the new field added to the string encoding strategy json. We can default to v1 in druid 27.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nThe `frontCoded` type of `stringEncodingStrategy` on `indexSpec`, has been improved with a new segment format version which typically has faster read speeds and reduced segment size. However, this improvement is backwards incompatible with Druid 25.0, so a new `formatVersion` option has been added, which defaults to the the current version `0`. This value can be specified explicitly as `1` to use start using the improved version after the ability to rollback to Druid 25.0 is no longer determined to be needed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #13972 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nAdded a function named normalizeHost(String host) to the file ServiceClientImpl.java, that will normalize host when it has brackets. Therefore, it can match the location in the list of serviceLocations. Added the test method in the ipv6 scenario to the ServiceClientImplTest.\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\nAdded a method to normalize host when network address is ipv6.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * ` ServiceClientImpl`\r\n * ` ServiceClientImplTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Fixes #13837.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the concept of input source type security model, proposed in #13837.. With this change, this feature is only available at the SQL layer, but we will expand to native layer in a follow up PR.\r\n\r\nTo enable this feature, the user must set the following property to true:\r\n\r\n`druid.auth.enableInputSourceSecurity=true`\r\n\r\nThe default value for this property is false, which will continue the existing functionality of having the usage all external sources being authorized against the hardcoded resource action\r\n\r\n`new ResourceAction(new Resource(ResourceType.EXTERNAL, ResourceType.EXTERNAL), Action.READ`\r\n\r\nWhen this config is enabled, the users will be required to be authorized for the following resource action\r\n\r\n`new ResourceAction(new Resource(ResourceType.EXTERNAL, {INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}, Action.READ`\r\n\r\nwhere `{INPUT_SOURCE_TYPE}` is the type of the input source being used;, http, inline, s3, etc..\r\n\r\nDocumentation has not been added for the feature as it is not complete at the moment, as we still need to enable this for the native layer in a follow up pr.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nFollow up to #13854, to add a backwards compatibility mode for users of Druid 25.0 to upgrade to Druid 26.0 in a manner that allows for errorless rolling upgrades and downgrades by writing out the older format version. \r\n\r\n#### ~~Release note~~\r\n~~The `frontCoded` type of `stringEncodingStrategy` on `indexSpec`, has been improved with a new segment format version which typically has faster read speeds and reduced segment size. However, this improvement is backwards incompatible with Druid 25.0, so a new `formatVersion` option has been added, which defaults to the new `1`, but can be specified as `0` to allow migration to Druid 26.0 by the way of writing out the older format until the ability to rollback to Druid 25.0 is no longer determined to be needed.~~\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nDuring ingestion, incremental segments are created in memory for the different time chunks and persisted to disk when certain thresholds are reached (max number of rows, max memory, incremental persist period etc). In the case where there are a lot of dimension and metrics (1000+) it was observed that the creation/serialization of incremental segment file format for persistence and persisting the file took a while and it was blocking ingestion of new data. This affected the real-time ingestion. This serialization and persistence can be parallelized across the different time chunks. This update aims to do that.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nThe patch adds a simple configuration parameter to the ingestion tuning configuration to specify number of persistence threads. The default value is 1 if it not specified which makes it the same as it is today.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nAdded a configuration parameter to specify number of threads to use for persisting incremental segments.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `StreamAppenderator`\r\n * `AppenderatorImpl`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nA sort of follow-up to #12830, which added `NumericRangeIndex` to improve the performance of nested column bound filters on numeric columns, but noted that there were still cases where the cost of bitmap operations overran the cost of just doing a full scan and using value matchers. This is also more or less the same thing described in #3878.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to improve this situation by adding cardinality based thresholds for range and predicate indexes to choose to skip using bitmap indexes.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* adds `skipValueRangeIndexScale` and `skipValuePredicateIndexScale` to `ColumnConfig` (e.g. `DruidProcessingConfig`) available as system config via `druid.processing.indexes.skipValueRangeIndexScale` and `druid.processing.indexes.skipValuePredicateIndexScale`\r\n* `NestedColumnIndexSupplier` uses `skipValueRangeIndexScale` and `skipValuePredicateIndexScale` to multiply by the total number of rows to be processed to determine the threshold at which we should no longer consider using bitmap indexes because it will be too many operations\r\n* Default values for `skipValueRangeIndexScale` and `skipValuePredicateIndexScale` have been initially set to 0.08, but are separate to allow independent tuning\r\n* these are not documented on purpose yet because they are kind of hard to explain, the mainly exist to help conduct larger scale experiments than the jmh benchmarks used to derive the initial set of values\r\n* these changes provide a pretty sweet performance boost for filter processing on nested columns\r\n\r\nWe might want to consider making these same changes to `DictionaryEncodedStringIndexSupplier`, but I have not done so at this time.\r\n\r\n#### Benchmarks comparing to regular columns\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT SUM(long1) FROM foo WHERE double3 < 10000.0 AND double3 > 1000.0\r\nSELECT

Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Do not print error message if pod not found when getting task location\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the the pod won't be found in the case that the pod has completed.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesTaskRunner`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nBroker maintains a timeline of segments which it builds overtime upon receiving updates from historical server and it uses this timeline to answer queries. Broker isn’t aware of what segments actually exists in the druid system. The result of this gap is incomplete query responses on some occasions. \r\n\r\nWith this feature the goal is to ensure, if a segment was queryable at one point in time, any future query over that segment would either include that segment or fail (unless it's replication factor is changed to 0).  \r\n\r\n### Design \r\nThis change introduces a state for segment metadata called `loaded`, it is set to true, when a segment has been loaded onto some historical. \r\nBroker polls the coordinator periodically to get all the used segments in the system, it merges all the `loaded` segment from this set into its timeline of segments. This timeline now consists of segments which are available on some historical server and which aren’t available on any server, this information helps the broker identify unavailable segments for the query. \r\n\r\nThis approach also ensures that any segment which has just been published but not loaded by any historical server doesn’t cause query failure. \r\n\r\n### Major changes\r\n\r\n#### Coordinator changes\r\n- Add a new column `has_loaded` in the druid_segments metadata table to represent if a segment has ever been loaded on a historical (changes in `SQLMetadataConnector`).\r\n\r\n- Set the `has_loaded` field for a segment to true when the Coordinator receives notification from the historical. \r\n\r\n- Update `DataSourcesSnapshot` to maintain diff of the segments from the previous poll.  \r\n\r\n- Add coordinator API  `MetadataResource#getChangedSegments` to send either full snapshot or delta changes to the broker using the information present in `DataSourcesSnapshot`\r\n\r\n- Changed classes: `CoordinatorServerView`, `SqlSegmentsMetadataManager`, `SqlSegmentsMetadataQuery`, `MetadataResource`, `DataSourcesSnapshot`\r\n\r\n#### Broker changes\r\n- `MetadataSegmentView` polls the coordinator to fetch the list of all used segments along with their `overshadowed` and `loaded` status, on the very first poll it receives a full snapshot thereafter it receives delta updates. \r\n\r\n- After the finish of every poll, notify BrokerServerView to update its timeline with all segments that have been loaded\r\n   - Remove segments that are not used anymore i.e. segments that are not present in the list polled from the coordinator\r\n   - Add segments that are used and loaded to the timeline, if they don’t already exist\r\n\r\n- While handling a query on the broker, lookup the segments required for the query from the timeline. If any of these segments is unavailable, throw an error.\r\n\r\n- Changed classes: `CachingClusteredClient`, `BrokerServerView`, `MetadataSegmentView`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Segment lifecycle \r\n\r\nThe lifecycle of a segment `s` can be described as follows:\r\n\r\n`Creation`: Segment metadata is published in the database at time `t1`.\r\n`Coordinator Polling`: The Coordinator polls for new segments at time `t2` but does not consider `s` loaded yet.\r\n`Broker Polling`: The Broker polls the Coordinator at time `t3` and finds segment `s` but doesn't add it to the timeline as it's not loaded.\r\n`Historical Loading`: The segment `s` is loaded by a Historical process at time `t4`.\r\n`Coordinator Update`: The Coordinator receives a callback from the Historical and marks the segment as `loaded` at time `t5`.\r\n\r\n#### Segment Availability\r\n\r\nOnce marked as `loaded`, a segment is considered available for querying. However, there are potential scenarios that can impact segment availability:\r\n\r\n##### Scenario 1: Broker Receives Segment Metadata Before Historical Callback\r\n\r\n* The Broker adds `s` to the timeline as `queryable` at time `t6`.\r\n* Queries for `s` at this point might fail as it's not fully loaded.\r\n* Once the Broker receives the callback from the Historical at time `t7`, the segment becomes available for querying.\r\n* If all Historicals serving `s` go down, the segment remains in the timeline as `queryable` but becomes unavailable for querying.\r\n\r\n##### Scenario 2: Broker Receives Historical Callback Before Segment Metadata\r\n\r\n* The Broker adds `s` to the timeline but doesn't mark it as `queryable` at time `t6`.\r\n* Queries for `s` will still be processed, but the segment might not be fully available.\r\n* Once the Broker receives metadata from the Coordinator at time `t7`, the segment is marked as `queryable`.\r\n* Similar to Scenario 1, if all Historicals serving `s` go down, the segment remains in the timeline as `queryable` but becomes unavailable for querying.\r\n\r\n### Synchronisation issues \r\nFollowing synchronisation conditions could cause temporary query failure,\r\n- If the broker isn’t able to sync its timeline with the coordinator, this would cause broker to be unaware of recently removed segments from the historical \r\n\r\n- If the broker is behind historical server, sync with coordinator makes it aware of recently loaded segments but the broker would think that they are unavailable \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Broker lags behind Historical</li>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>a. Coordinator tells broker that segment is used and loaded </li>\r\n <ul> \r\n <li>start failing if segment is unavailable immediately </li> \r\n <li>maybe also log historical sync times </li> \r\n  </ul>\r\n  <li>b.

Verify if this behaviour is as expected or needs change. \r\n* MetadataResource#getChangedSegments should also return realtime segments if `CentralizedDatasourceSchema` is enabled on the Coordinator. \r\n* Handle the scenario when the replication factor for a segment is updated to 0. \r\n* Verify the potential synchronisation issues. \r\n* Testing (unit tests, performance testing). \r\n* Document new API, metrics. \r\n \r\n#### Usage \r\n- `druid.sql.planner.detectUnavailbleSegments` needs to be set in broker runtime properties \r\n- `unavailableSegmentsAction` query context can be set to `allow` or `fail`, accordingly the queries would fail, in either case the unavailable segments will be logged. \r\n\r\n#### Upgrade considerations \r\nTBA\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nTBA \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n#### Pending items\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

recently added support for nested JSON types. The JSON-style of `extern()` can label input columns as a JSON object or array using the Druid `complex<json>` type. This PR adds an equivalent of the type to SQL using the `TYPE` keyword. Example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO dst SELECT *\r\nFROM TABLE(http(uris => ARRAY['http://foo.com/bar.json'],\r\n                format => 'csv'))\r\n     (x VARCHAR, y VARCHAR, z TYPE('COMPLEX<json>'))\r\nPARTITIONED BY ALL TIME\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe semantics are that the `z` column above is _some_ complex JSON type, but we don't care which: Druid's indexer will figure it out. Since we don't know the exact type (other than that it isn't simple), we let Druid do the work by declaring that the input column type varies: it is of Druid's type `COMPLEX<json>`. At run time, Druid will pick the actual type, which may be `COMPLEX<json>` or may be something else.\r\n\r\nThe argument to `TYPE()` is the name of a Druid type exactly as Druid expects it: upper case `COMPLEX` and lower case `json`.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nSee the comments above and the modified `reference.md` file.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

changes:\r\n\r\n1) Update CloudObjectInputSource and its subclasses (S3, GCS,\r\n   Azure, Aliyun OSS) to use SplitHintSpecs in all cases. Previously, they\r\n   were only used for prefixes, not uris or objects.\r\n\r\n2) Update ExternalInputSpecSlicer (MSQ) to consider file size. Previously,\r\n   file size was ignored; all files were treated as equal weight when\r\n   determining splits.\r\n\r\nA side effect of these changes is that we'll make additional network calls to find the sizes of objects when users specify URIs or objects as opposed to prefixes. IMO, this is worth it because it's the only way to respect the user's split hint and task assignment settings.\r\n\r\nSecondary changes:\r\n\r\n1) S3, Aliyun OSS: Use getObjectMetadata instead of listObjects to get\r\n   metadata for a single object. This is a simpler call that is also\r\n   expected to be less expensive.\r\n\r\n2) Azure: Fix a bug where getBlobLength did not populate blob\r\n   reference attributes, and therefore would not actually retrieve the\r\n   blob length.\r\n\r\n3) MSQ: Align dynamic slicing logic between ExternalInputSpecSlicer and\r\n   TableInputSpecSlicer.\r\n\r\n4) MSQ: Adjust WorkerInputs to ensure there is always at least one\r\n   worker, even if it has a nil slice.","created_at":"2023-03-21T01:10:43Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T10:56:05Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T15:54:01Z","merged_at":"2023-04-05T15:54:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"319f99db05aefb8f232dfbf265b38ca9541fef4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

some URL typos and add a few more variations for the `http()` table function tests.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the Calcite tests make use of the `toString()` functions to convert a native query to a string for comparison. The `HttpInputSource` is missing the `toString()` function and so generated a unique string for each object, which causes comparisons to fail. This PR also fixes a few of these nit issues.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nNo user-visible changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in

Description\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the ClientQuerySegmentWalker, when the data sources get inlined, they can be limited by the number of rows to prevent a query (subquery) from hogging up the broker's memory. This however doesn't have a proper correspondence with the memory used, since a row can have multiple columns with varying amounts of data in them. Therefore it would be better if a memory limit is also available, which prevents the subquery's results from exploding beyond a certain memory limit.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use the Frame which was introduced along with the MSQ to store the inline results. Since the Frames are backed by memory, we can fetch the memory used by the frame, and correspondingly the data source to estimate the size that is consumed by the inline data source. This is a close estimate of the size taken by the subquery results.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n1. User can set the `maxSubqueryBytes` key in the query context with the value that is the upper bound on the number of bytes the subquery's results can take.\r\n2. Often, the result types of the query's results are unknown to the broker. Materializing to frames require that the types be present, which can cause results to not be materialized. Therefore there is an additional undocumented parameter `useNestedForUnknownTypeInSubquery` parameter that by default is set to false but can be set to true, which controls how to handle the column's whose types are unknown (i.e. the columnType is empty/null). If the parameter is set, then the null types are serded as nested JSON data, which should handle most of the common cases.\r\n\r\n### Behaviour\r\nAs proposed in the [review comment](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13952#pullrequestreview-1409574208) if\r\n* if `maxSubqueryBytes` is not set\r\n    * We use `maxSubqueryRows` to limit the results of the subquery by the number of rows. Also, we execute the older code path, which doesn't materialize the results to frames\r\n* if `maxSubqueryBytes` is set\r\n  * if we can materialize the results of all the subqueries to frames\r\n    * We limit the results of the subquery by the number of bytes\r\n   * if we can't materialize the results of all the subqueries to frames\r\n     * We default to the old code path and limit the results of the subquery by the number of rows (if set). \r\n\r\n### Proposed changes\r\n1. ClientQuerySegmentWalker#toInlineDataSource now has distinct code paths which convert the results respectively to frames (new changes) or the iterable of rows (old changes)\r\n2. The query tool chests have been updated to materialize the results as frames if possible.\r\n\r\n### Supporting changes\r\n1. `FrameBasedIndexedTable` - An indexed table that works on the `FrameBasedInlineDataSource`. It indexes the key columns and provides a way to extract the columnReader for the columns of the data source\r\n3. `FrameBasedInlineDataSource` - Inline data source which is based upon an underlying list of frames. Frames can be written using individual row signatures. The datasource itself has its own signature which is \"cumulative\" signature of the underlying frames.\r\n4. `IterableRowsCursorHelper` - Creates a cursor from an iterable representing the rows of a datasource.\r\n5. `ConcatCursor` - Cursor representing concatenation of multiple underlying cursors.\r\n6. ScanResultValue has been updated to provide the row signature whenever present in the underlying datasources.\r\n7. `FrameBasedInlineDataSourceSerializer` - Serializes a `FrameBasedInlineDataSource` as if it was the traditional InlineDataSource. This is done to keep the communication protocol between the broker and the data servers (historicals) unchanged.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n* The set of changes has been tested on the existing CalciteQueryTests stack.\r\n* The changes have been tested on a local deployment\r\n\r\n### Impact on existing deployments\r\n1. This change shouldn't affect the existing deployments. The communication protocol between the broker and the historical is unchanged (the frame-based datasources, inline as existing traditional datasources).\r\n2. The change to `ScanResultValue` shouldn't affect the upgrade process since historicals are updated before the brokers in the proper upgrade method, therefore brokers can always assume that the `ScanResultValue` should contain the updated information (of signature). Broker's currently don't break even if the fetched `ScanResultvalue` has rowSignature as null, therefore existing deployments shouldn't be affected\r\n3. The new code paths are only deployed when the memory limit is mentioned by the user in the queries, therefore existing queries should continue to work as is, without any performance impacts. \r\n\r\n### Follow up\r\n1. Create an automatic user-friendly configuration based on the [guidelines](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13952#pullrequestreview-1409574208).\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nUsers can now add a guardrail to prevent subquery’s results from exceeding the set number of bytes by setting `druid.server.http.maxSubqueryRows` in Broker's config or `maxSubqueryRows` in the query context. This feature is experimental for now and would default back to row-based limiting in case it fails to get the accurate size of the results consumed by the query.\r\n \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nchanges:\r\n* fixes inconsistent handling of byte[] values between `ExprEval.bestEffortOf` and `ExprEval.ofType`, which could cause `byte[]` values to end up as java `toString` values instead of base64 encoded strings in ingest time transforms\r\n* improved `ExpressionTransform` binding to re-use `ExprEval.bestEffortOf` when evaluating a binding instead of throwing it away\r\n* improved `ExpressionTransform` array handling in anticipation of #13803, added `RowFunction.evalDimension` that returns `List<String>` to back `Row.getDimension` and remove the automatic coercing of array types that would typically happen to `ExpressionTransform` now _unless_ using `Row.getDimension`\r\n* improved `ExpressionPostAggregator` to use partial type information from decoration\r\n* added some tests for `ExpressionTransform` with array inputs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n#### Release

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a join query planning regression caused by #13902. After that change, this query will actually plan \"correctly\" but then later explode due to duplicate join prefix. The planner was selecting a join prefix only looking at the `RowSignature` of the left and right side datasources, but if those queries had any nested join prefixes, the query would later fail because the native prefix checker flattens the join to check prefixes (so losing the context of what is used directly in outside layers).\r\n\r\nThe solution Ive added is to just dig through the datasources to extract any existing prefixes and add that to the checked set when selecting new prefixes, to ensure the planner never picks duplicate prefixes even if it can't see them at the top level.\r\n\r\nThe added test plans and produces the same result as prior to #13902. Full disclaimer, I didn't actually work out the answer by hand to ensure that it was correct (the repro query was relayed to me), but at least it isn't different than before the change 😅 .\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\n1. Round-robin segment assignment greatly speeds up coordinator run times and is hugely beneficial to all clusters.\r\n2. Batch segment allocation works extremely well when you have multiple concurrent realtime tasks for a single supervisor. It has not been seen to adversely affect other cases either, such as those with multiple supervisors with a handful of concurrent tasks each.\r\n\r\nWe have had both of these flags turned on in our prod clusters and they have been working successfully.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n- Set `useRoundRobinSegmentAssignment` in coordinator dynamic config to `true` by default\r\n- Set `batchSegmentAllocation` in `TaskLockConfig` (used in Overlord runtime properties) to `true` by default\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Turn on round-robin segment assignment by default. This can be turned off (never advised) by setting `useRoundRobinSegmentAssignment=false` in the coordinator dynamic config.\r\n- Turn on batch segment allocation by default. You may turn this off (only advised in the cases below) by setting `druid.overlord.tasklock.batchSegmentAllocation=false` in the Overlord runtime properties.\r\n  - `task/action/run/time` metric values increase significantly after an upgrade to this version\r\n  - there are failures in batch allocation\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

thinking with the current defaults is that for best ingestion throughput, we want intermediate persists to be as big as possible without using up all available memory. So, we rely mainly on maxBytesInMemory. The default maxRowsInMemory (1 million) is really just a safety: in case we have a large number of very small rows, we don't want to get overwhelmed by per-row overheads.\r\n\r\nHowever, maximum ingestion throughput isn't necessarily the primary goal for realtime ingestion. Query performance is also important. And because query performance is not as good on the in-memory dataset, it's helpful to keep it from growing too large. 150k seems like a reasonable balance here. It means that for a typical 5 million row segment, we won't trigger more than 33 persists due to this limit, which is a reasonable number of persists.","created_at":"2023-03-15T19:16:13Z","updated_at":"2023-05-12T22:32:01Z","closed_at":"2023-03-21T17:36:36Z","merged_at":"2023-03-21T17:36:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c7a03a47be652853a9991f79716f69e0ad39bd4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563043,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Streaming%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nSwitch to Dart Sass so that the web console can be compiled on Mac arm64 architectures.\r\n\r\nThis necessitated two changes:\r\n- Shim the `svg-icons` function because we don't have access to it. Apparently [it's possible to use from Blueprint's build system](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/issues/5334#issuecomment-1444223876) but this also requires copying the icon SVG files into the repo since they're not included in npm. It was simpler to render `transparent` for these, since the function was only being used for breadcrumbs and the Web Console doesn't use Blueprint's breadcrumbs (AFAIK)\r\n- Upgrade Blueprint to pull in [these changes](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/pull/5216) that make its scss source compatible with Dart Sass\r\n\r\nI also ran `sass-migrator` to clean up deprecated syntax in our local scss files.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

the following:\r\n\r\n1. Removed the right filter transform\r\n2. Since Calcite already figured out the filter on top of uncollect that is pushed inside the data source\r\n3. Rest of the filters on the left behave as earlier\r\n4. Slight change in logic in filter rewrite as we not have to iterate over filter list to find filters on unnested column\r\n5. Fix for selector filters by removing the intermediate project above the DruidUnnestRel only when it is doing a CAST or LITERAL\r\n6. Handling special case for OR filters involving unnested column and regular left data source columns which are planned on top of Correlate\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR adds some additional null checks to `HttpServerInventoryView`, `HttpRemoteTaskRunner`, `LookupNodeDiscovery`, and `SystemSchema` to ensure that the `DruidService` they are trying to extract from `DiscoveryDruidNode` are not null.\r\n\r\nThis change was motivated by an encounter with a null pointer exception in `HttpServerInventoryView` when using 'indexer' nodes to handle ingestion, which prior to #12640 used to announce themselves as both 'indexer' and 'peon' node roles, with the latter having an empty services set. When the indexer goes offline, the empty services section caused a null pointer exception since it was expected to never be null.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIntroduce a SQL interface for the distinctcount extension, via a new function `SEGMENT_DISTINCT`.\r\n\r\nAdded `calcite` and `druid-sql` as dependencies of distinctcount, then introduced `SegmentDistinctSqlAggregator`, an implementation of calcite's `SqlAggregator`\r\n\r\nNeed some direction on documentation. For example, would we want to see the SQL equivalents of the examples that already exist [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/docs/development/extensions-contrib/distinctcount.md)?

breakage.","created_at":"2023-03-09T22:53:08Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:01:06Z","closed_at":"2023-03-10T05:06:35Z","merged_at":"2023-03-10T05:06:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b90a320cf737264da551069c843692a32424509","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":606691557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDY2OTE1NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Compatibility","name":"Compatibility","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/50","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/50","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/50/labels","id":9225391,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4AjMSv","number":50,"title":"26.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":458,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-03-30T06:36:07Z","updated_at":"2023-05-24T05:28:09Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2023-05-24T05:28:09Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/13914/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/13914/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/13914/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/45a6c99d7111f8371d95e3623fef088b047c21a3","head":{"label":"imply-cheddar:add-signature-for-compat","ref":"add-signature-for-compat","sha":"45a6c99d7111f8371d95e3623fef088b047c21a3","user":{"login":"imply-cheddar","id":86940447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTQwNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86940447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/imply-cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":436218453,"node_id":"R_kgDOGgAqVQ","name":"druid","full_name":"imply-cheddar/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imply-cheddar","id":86940447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTQwNDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86940447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/imply-cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imply-cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imply-cheddar/druid","description":"Apache

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nThis makes the zookeeper connection retry count configurable. This is presently hardcoded to 29 tries which ends up taking a long time for the druid node to shutdown in case of ZK connectivity loss. \r\nHaving a shorter retry count helps k8s deployments to fail fast. In situations where the underlying k8s node loses network connectivity or is no longer able to talk to zookeeper, failing fast can trigger pod restarts which can then reassign the pod to a healthy k8s node.  \r\nExisting behavior is preserved, but users can override this property if needed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CuratorConfig`\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

out catalog-specific changes from the [Catalog Calcite integration PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13686) to allow easier reviewing.\r\n\r\n* Changes catalog table entries to Druid types\r\n* Enhanced support for external tables, including functions\r\n* Revised catalog sync API\r\n\r\nThe key change here is to use Druid types, rather than SQL types, when declaring the schema of a table in the catalog. Druid types better match the actual Druid implementation whereas SQL types are just a SQL \"view\" on top of the actual Druid types. This change will allow us to use complex types which will be useful for specifying aggregate columns.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nNo user-visible changes yet. The docs for the catalog will appear in a later PR after the Calcite integration is complete.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR was split out of the [\"big\" catalog PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13686/commits).\r\n\r\nRefactors the Druid planner to move `INSERT` and `REPLACE` validation out of the statement handers and into the Calcite validator. This is the right place for validation in general, and is required for the catalog integration to be added in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n* Validation for MSQ statements moves out of the handers into a Druid-specific version of the SQL validator.\r\n* Druid-specific Calcite operator to represent a Druid ingest.\r\n* Extends the PARTITION BY clause to accept string literals for the time partitioning\r\n\r\nMost changes are purely mechanical. One that is not is the way that the `PARTITIONED BY` grain is represented in the AST. Prior to this commit, `PARTITIONED BY` was represented as a Druid granularity object. However, the Calcite validator requires that all properties of an AST node be a subclass of `SqlNode`, which `Granularity` is not. To solve this, the granularity is represented as a string `SqlLiteral` in the AST, and validated into a Druid granularity in the validator. This is probably a better choice, now that we can do it. A side effect of this change is that the parser can now allow string literals for `PARTITIONED BY`. Example: `PARTITIONED BY 'P1D'`. This seems safe because, in Druid, partitioning is always by time and gives the segment grain. We are unlikely to change the segment grain idea any time soon.\r\n\r\nThis PR also forbids the use of the `WEEK` (or `P1W`) granularity, since earlier feedback indicated we no longer wish to support that gain.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces another option for how to specify time granularity: by using ISO-8601 periods and Druid period names as a string argument to `PARTITIONED BY`. See `reference.md` for details.\r\n\r\n#### Hints to reviewers\r\n\r\nThe real core of this PR is `sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/planner/DruidSqlValidator.java`: the place where we moved the former ad-hoc `INSERT` and `REPLACE` validation to instead run within the SQL validator.\r\n\r\nNo runtime code was changed: all the non-trivial changes are in the SQL planner.\r\n\r\nThe code here is identical to that in the \"full\" PR: all prior review comments are reflected. The only difference is that the validator in this PR omits the catalog integration from the full PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
