The code \"hiveStmt.setInPlaceUpdateStream(InPlaceUpdateStream stream)\" in HiveUtils uses InPlaceUpdateStream class which is only available in version 2.3 or above, which leads to runtime NoClassDefFoundError.  Move the code into ProgressBar to delay NoClassDefFoundError of InPlaceUpdateStream until ProgressBar instanced. When hive < 2.3, ProgressBar will not be instanced, so it works well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix | Improvement ]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5141\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Test the hive interpreter(jdbc) with version both above 2.3 and below 2.3 to check whether it can work well.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nWith #3914 I removed the logging libraries for Zeppelin-Interpreters which are not shipped with their own logging libraries (e.g. Markdown). The logging libraries are not part of zeppelin-interpreter-shaded. With this change we add the logging libraries back to interpreter-parent, so that they are present in every Zeppelin-Interpreters process.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n - Hot Fix\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Travis-CI: https://travis-ci.org/github/Reamer/zeppelin/builds/732966733\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-05T13:54:35Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T08:38:14Z","closed_at":"2020-10-05T16:04:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f666f1993998c46fa61b940f1041eeccbddd438","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3934/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3934/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3934/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/39b8edbcda4733e9921b41858a44a2f30b66159d","head":{"label":"Reamer:hotfix_logging","ref":"hotfix_logging","sha":"39b8edbcda4733e9921b41858a44a2f30b66159d","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203154995,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDMxNTQ5OTU=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Reamer/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nIf a paragraph fails on something other than exception in Zeppelin, notebook will continue running paragraphs after it. This is unintuitive and regression from previous version.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, return \"false\" from running a paragraph, if it the actual user code fails. Also, after a failing \"run all\" operation, we need to broadcast paragraph states to client, so they wont stay in pending state after a failed run.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nBug

What is this PR for?\r\nAs described in the linked issue, there has been a bug where, when a user creates or updates a note, that user's note list is published to all connected users, instead of their own note lists. This has the security problem that it leaks information about a user's note list to other users who may not have permission to see it. This PR fixes that bug by querying each connected user's note list and publishing that instead.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5061\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nManual testing:\r\n* Configure a list of users using a `shiro.ini` file. Example:\r\n```\r\n[users]\r\n# List of users with their password allowed to access Zeppelin.\r\n# To use a different strategy (LDAP / Database / ...) check the shiro doc at http://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html#Configuration-INISections\r\nadmin = password1, admin\r\nuser1 = password2, role1\r\nuser2 = password3, role1\r\n```\r\n* Turn off public notebooks in `zeppelin-site.xml` by setting the property `zeppelin.notebook.public` to `false`\r\n* Boot Zeppelin server on this PR\r\n* Log in as user1\r\n* In a separate browser, log in as user2\r\n* As user1, create a note\r\nPrevious result: user1's note appears on user2's dashboard. Refreshing user2's browser will cause the note to disappear from their dashboard.\r\nFixed expectations:\r\n- user1's note does not appear on user2's dashboard.\r\n- the display of any notes created by user1 is not affected when user2 creates a note\r\n- when `zeppelin.notebook.public` is set to `true`, user1's note appears as expected on user1's

What is this PR for?\r\nThese PR touch the start and stop procedures of all interpreters.\r\n - improved start script with [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) recommendations\r\n - Use `exec [...]` instead of `eval [..] &`, which means that the Java interpreter process is not a fork of the shell script\r\n   -> no trap handling required in the start script\r\n   -> signals land in the JVM\r\n - Correct escaping is done by the start-script\r\n - remove anonymous threads in 'RemoteInterpreterServer.java and give the thread nice names\r\n - Use TServer's StopTimeoutVal and stopTimeoutUnit for faster shutdown\r\n - remove special K8s shutdown handling\r\n - unregister interpreter during unpredictable shutdown\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n - Improvement

No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-25T13:36:15Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T07:04:51Z","closed_at":"2020-11-06T10:24:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c9ba9824b93cb7670e4f1977a9eb7e6f31e5d7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3925/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3925/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3925/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/c4da96114053b43f37264a40ef4badecbd06c50b","head":{"label":"Reamer:signal_start_stop_handling","ref":"signal_start_stop_handling","sha":"c4da96114053b43f37264a40ef4badecbd06c50b","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203154995,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDMxNTQ5OTU=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Reamer/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer/zeppelin","description":"Mirror
