What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWIP\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48529, we added SQL pipe syntax support for aggregation. This PR extends that by adding GROUP BY ALL support.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT 1 AS x, 2 AS y\r\nUNION ALL SELECT 1, 1\r\n|> AGGREGATE x, SUM(y) GROUP BY ALL\r\n\r\n1\t3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-11-05T00:38:15Z","updated_at":"2024-11-08T17:45:24Z","closed_at":"2024-11-08T17:45:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8dc72f2085475125969d37efadba190ab187517f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48754/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48754/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48754/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a40d8adefa53c4548ea80104e6400f4f692b00b4","head":{"label":"dtenedor:pipe-group-by-all","ref":"pipe-group-by-all","sha":"a40d8adefa53c4548ea80104e6400f4f692b00b4","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis fix ensures that `from_json` and `from_xml` return the exact schema provided, even when session collation is set.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen serializing schema with the `sql` method, parsing it back can yield a different schema if session collation is set. This fix maintains consistency in schema structure regardless of collation settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nImplement new aggregation function `listagg([ALL | DISTINCT] expr[, sep]) [WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY key [ASC | DESC] [,...])]`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nListagg is a popular function implemented by many other vendors. For now, users have to use workarounds like [this](https://kb.databricks.com/sql/recreate-listagg-functionality-with-spark-sql). PR will close the gap.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the new `listagg` function. BigQuery and PostgreSQL have the same function but with `string_agg` name so I added it as an alias.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith new unit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nComparing https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c53dac05058c48ae1edad7912e8cc82533839ca0/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L102 and https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9d472661daad4703628e9fbf0ba9922abeed7354/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L97, the master branch uses `dev/is-changed.py` to check for changes in additional modules: `variant`, `api`, `streaming-kinesis-asl`, `protobuf`, and `connect`. Among these, the `api`, `protobuf`, and `connect` modules also exist in the `branch-3.5` and should be checked as well.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this pr includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Adds `is-changed` checks for the `api`, `protobuf`, and `connect` modules.\r\n2. In `dev/sparktestsupport/modules.py`, adds the definition for the `api` module, aligning with the master branch.\r\n3. In `dev/sparktestsupport/modules.py`, adds the definition for the `utils` module, aligning with the master branch. Prior to this PR, although `dev/is-changed.py` was used to check for changes in the `utils` module, its definition was missing from `dev/sparktestsupport/modules.py`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the conditional check for executing the `build` task in `build_and_test.yml`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n- Manually verified the effectiveness of this pull request:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nSet the latest commit by executing `export APACHE_SPARK_REF=9d472661daad4703628e9fbf0ba9922abeed7354`. Then manually edit files in the `api`, `protobuf`, or `connect` modules and commit them. Run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./dev/is-changed.py -m \"core,unsafe,kvstore,avro,utils,network-common,network-shuffle,repl,launcher,examples,sketch,graphx,catalyst,hive-thriftserver,streaming,sql-kafka-0-10,streaming-kafka-0-10,mllib-local,mllib,yarn,mesos,kubernetes,hadoop-cloud,spark-ganglia-lgpl,sql,hive,connect,protobuf,api\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe console will print `false`.\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nSet the latest commit by executing `export APACHE_SPARK_REF=41446b3d98cfccf5c6f6ddb8bc3c7c6c1b1c3f54`. Then manually edit files in the `api`, `protobuf`, or `connect` modules and commit them.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `SparkSubmit` to show `REST API` `kill` response properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n**PREPARE SPARK CLUSTER**\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_MASTER_OPTS='-Dspark.master.rest.enabled=true' sbin/start-master.sh\r\n$ sbin/start-worker.sh spark://$(hostname):7077\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE (4.0.0-preview2)**\r\n`spark-submit` didn't show error messages properly.\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-submit --master spark://$(hostname):6066 --kill invalid-submission-id\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-submit --master spark://$(hostname):6066 --kill invalid-submission-id\r\nError: Driver invalid-submission-id has already finished or

logs show additional log messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests because this requires a Spark Standalone Cluster and the difference is only a log of `spark-submit`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnabling usage of passthrough expressions for trim collation. \r\nAs with this change there will be more expressions that will support trim collation then those who don't in follow up default for support trim collation will be set on true.\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE: it looks like a tons of changes but only changes are:\r\nfor each expression set supportsTrimCollation=true and add tests.**\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSo that all expressions could be used with trim collation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd tests to CollationSqlExpressionsSuite\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, I propose adding a separate collation id for `UTF8_BINARY` collation and for non-collated string type. Furthermore, refactoring of all classes that directly compare `collationId` is proposed, so that `UTF8_BINARY` and `NON_COLLATED_STRING_COLLATION` are considered the same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n These changes are needed to differentiate between test cases when we have just a string (e.g. `\"abc\"`) and a string collated with `UTF8_BINARY` collation (e.g. `\"abc\" COLLATE UTF8_BINARY`). This would also simplify the collation precedence in case of non-collated strings collation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch was tested by modifying existing tests in `CollationFactorySuite` and `CollationExpressionSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-11-01T14:55:31Z","updated_at":"2024-12-17T13:55:26Z","closed_at":"2024-12-17T13:55:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48737/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48737/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48737/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8938466958ddd0c4f7453a5bce3defdcd696e823","head":{"label":"vladanvasi-db:vladanvasi-db/utf8-binary-refactor","ref":"vladanvasi-db/utf8-binary-refactor","sha":"8938466958ddd0c4f7453a5bce3defdcd696e823","user":{"login":"vladanvasi-db","id":177719017,"node_id":"U_kgDOCpfG6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177719017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladanvasi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":844552718,"node_id":"R_kgDOMlbaDg","name":"spark","full_name":"vladanvasi-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vladanvasi-db","id":177719017,"node_id":"U_kgDOCpfG6Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/177719017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladanvasi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladanvasi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vladanvasi-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `StandaloneRestServer` to propagate `spark.app.name` to `SparkSubmit` properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a long-standing bug which PySpark job didn't get a proper `spark.app.name` propagation unlike Scala/Java Spark jobs. Since PySpark jobs are invoked indirectly via `SparkSubmit`, we need to hand over `spark.app.name` via `-c` configuration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is a bug fix. The new behavior is the expected bahavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test case.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd stateful processor handle APIs using implicit encoders in Scala\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout the changes, users have to pass explicit SQL encoders for state types while acquiring an instance of the underlying state variable\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nUsers can now implicits available in Scala through `import spark.implicits._` and only provide the type while getting the state objects. For eg -\r\n\r\n```\r\n      override def init(outputMode: OutputMode, timeMode: TimeMode): Unit = {\r\n         _myValueState = getHandle.getValueState[Long](\"myValueState\", TTLConfig.NONE)\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for the FROM operator.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t(x INT, y STRING) USING CSV;\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES (0, 'abc'), (1, 'def');\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE other(a INT, b INT) USING JSON;\r\nINSERT INTO other VALUES (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4);\r\n\r\nFROM t\r\n|> SELECT 1 AS X;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAllow users to use `FROM` in the pipe syntax format.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAs indicated in the example.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested using `SparkSqlParserSuite`. A test case is also added in `pipe-operators.sql` as an end-to-end check. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to print the `server's webUrl` when the connect client (includes: `scala client` and `python client`) starts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow suppose a scenario where an end-user starts a `connect client` locally and executes some SQL. At that time, `he/her` wants to have a `deeper understanding` of the SQL execution status, but there is currently `no way`. Therefore, I propose that when `the connect client` starts, the `spark web URL` of the server should be displayed to the end-user for observation and monitoring.\r\n\r\n- Scala Client\r\n  -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `spark.app.name` property optional in REST API.\r\n\r\n- When `spark.app.name` is given, Spark 4 will work in the same way without a behavior change like `app-20241030130510-0000` in the following.\r\n- When `spark.app.name` is omitted, Spark 4 will work without any problem like `app-20241030130520-0001` in the following.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-10-30 at 13 05 39](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d75789c-020f-4a0f-9b45-70c1b9e8cde3)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLike `SparkSession` and `SparkContext`, `spark.app.name` is optional.\r\n\r\n- `SparkSession`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bb8b691b0f66cf50937f24d0b63342ca0da07e9c/python/pyspark/sql/session.py#L396-L399\r\n\r\n- `SparkContext`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bb8b691b0f66cf50937f24d0b63342ca0da07e9c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSession.scala#L890-L892\r\n\r\nHowever, `CreateSubmissionRequest` enforces `spark.app.name` existence like the following.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"action\" : \"ErrorResponse\",\r\n  \"message\" : \"Malformed request: org.apache.spark.deploy.rest.SubmitRestProtocolException: Validation of message CreateSubmissionRequest failed!...\",\r\n  \"serverSparkVersion\" : \"4.0.0-preview2\"\r\n}%\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-30T19:32:00Z","updated_at":"2024-10-31T03:23:16Z","closed_at":"2024-10-31T03:23:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b937b78257cb7f833542bbe4f9c0badab6d347a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1496047285,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDk2MDQ3Mjg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/EXAMPLES","name":"EXAMPLES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48711/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48711/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48711/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/35a5eefce15892ef4db5f764dd702d57eff8bf66","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-50179","ref":"SPARK-50179","sha":"35a5eefce15892ef4db5f764dd702d57eff8bf66","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to move `scala` and `java` files to their default folders (`src/main/scala` and `src/main/java`), includes:\r\n- `ByteArrayUtils.java` \r\n  from: `common/utils/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/unsafe/array/ByteArrayUtils.java` \r\n  to: `common/utils/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/unsafe/array/ByteArrayUtils.java`\r\n- `CustomDecimal.scala`\r\n  from: `connector/avro/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/avro/CustomDecimal.scala` \r\n  to: `connector/avro/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/avro/CustomDecimal.scala`\r\n\r\nPS: The pr is backport branch-3.5, master pr is: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48691\r\nNote: In branch-3.5, the `OrcCompressionCodec.java` file does not exist, so there is no need to move it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMove `scala` and `java` files to the default folder of the project to avoid `misunderstandings` for spark developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-30T02:45:19Z","updated_at":"2024-10-30T17:22:24Z","closed_at":"2024-10-30T10:05:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5c7879feefbdaf08c87c377ca1a8da55bf6c164","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8d43ec5f23dfc3ea1519eccb00c60f2e20413f73","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-50155_branch3.5","ref":"SPARK-50155_branch3.5","sha":"8d43ec5f23dfc3ea1519eccb00c60f2e20413f73","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds a new `releaseForThread(opType, threadRef)` method that only releases the RocksDB acquireLock if the provided threadRef is the same as the threadRef in `acquiredThreadInfo`. Also, modify the task completion listener created in `acquire` to use the new method so that it doesn't accidentally release the lock if it's owned by another thread. \r\n\r\nAlso some small changes to usages of acquire() and release() in `rollback` and `close` to follow this pattern to avoid extraneous or missed releases due to exceptions/interrupts: \r\n```\r\nacquire()\r\ntry {\r\n  ...\r\n} finally {\r\n  release()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere currently exists a race condition in RocksDB where the completion listener may release a lock validly held by another thread, resulting in a thread-unsafe condition. We have seen this bug in production.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests in RocksDB.scala, all other unit tests continue to pass as expected.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport customising kafka record timestamps via an optional column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs stated in the JIRA ticket, we do a lot of event-time processing to kafka records reflecting that would be nice.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, kafka docs need an update to reflect the new, optional timestamp column (of type long/timestamp).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a unit test that makes sure the timestamps get passed through as expected.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-29T14:50:20Z","updated_at":"2024-11-12T05:50:28Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c13eea5ee3b8c9237bc6e1141118eed81297e09d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a separate docker file for doc build\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\ncurrently we only have single test image, for `pyspark`, `sparkr`, `lint` and `docs`, it has two major issues:\r\n1, disk space limitation: we are adding more and more packages in it, the disk space left for testing is very limited, and cause `No space left on device` from time to time;\r\n2, environment conflicts: for example, even though we already install some packages for `docs` in the docker file, we still need to install some additional python packages in `build_and_test`, due to the conflicts between `docs` and `pyspark`. It is hard to maintain because the related packages are installed in two different places.\r\n\r\nso I am thinking of spinning off some installations (e.g. `docs`) from the base image, so that:\r\n1, we can completely cache all the dependencies for `docs`;\r\n2, the related installations are centralized;\r\n3, we can free up disk space on the base image (after we spin off other dependency, we can remove unneeded packages from it);\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if we want to apply multiple images, we can easily support different environments, e.g. adding a separate image for old versions of `pandas/pyarrow/etc`. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno, infra-only\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nci\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to add `name` to `RuleExecutor` to make printing `QueryExecutionMetrics`'s logs clearer. \r\nOtherwise, the following printing is meaningless (without knowing that `RuleExecutor`'s metric is being output)\r\n```shell\r\n24/10/29 15:12:33 WARN PlanChangeLogger:\r\n=== Metrics of Executed Rules ===\r\nTotal number of runs: 100\r\nTotal time: 0.8585 ms\r\nTotal number of effective runs: 0\r\nTotal time of effective runs: 0.0 ms\r\n\r\n24/10/29 15:12:33 WARN PlanChangeLogger:\r\n=== Metrics of Executed Rules ===\r\nTotal

becomes clearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually check\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes the following changes:\r\n- It adds shims for a couple of a number of classes exposed in the (classic) SQL interface:  `BaseRelation` , `ExperimentalMethods`, `ExecutionListenerManager`, `SharedState`, `SessionState`, `SparkConf`, `SparkSessionExtensions`, `QueryExecution`, and `SQLContext`.\r\n- It adds all public methods involving these classes. For classic they will just work like before. For connect they will throw `SparkUnsupportedOperationExceptions` when used.\r\n- It reduces the visibility of a couple of classes added recently: `DataSourceRegistration`, and `UDTFRegistration`.\r\n- I have also reorganized all the shims into a single class.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is by no means reflects the final state:\r\n- We intent to support `SQLContext`.\r\n- We intent to support 'SparkSession.executeCommand`.\r\n- We are thinking about removing `ExperimentalMethods`, `SharedState`, `SessionState` from the public interface.\r\n- For `QueryExecution`, and `ExecutionListenerManager` we are considering adding a plan representation similar that is not tied to Catalyst.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are creating a shared Scala (JVM) SQL interface for both Classic and Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt adds unusable public methods to the connect interface.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have added tests that checks if the connect client throws the proper exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds support for users to provide a Dataframe that can be used to instantiate state for the query in the first batch for arbitrary state API v2. More specifically, this dataframe is coming from state data source reader.\r\n\r\nRemove the restraints that initialState dataframe can only contains one value row for a grouping key. This is to enable the integration with state data source reader. In flattened state data source reader for composite type, we will have multiple value rows mapping to the same grouping key.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can union dataframe created by state data source reader on a single state variable and union them together and get an output dataframe as initial state for a transformWithState operator like this:\r\n```\r\n+-----------+-----+---------+----------+------------+\r\n|groupingKey|value|listValue|userMapKey|userMapValue|\r\n+-----------+-----+---------+----------+------------+\r\n|a          |3    |NULL     |NULL      |NULL        |\r\n|b          |2    |NULL     |NULL      |NULL        |\r\n|a          |NULL |1        |NULL      |NULL        |\r\n|a          |NULL |2        |NULL      |NULL        |\r\n|a          |NULL |3        |NULL      |NULL        |\r\n|b          |NULL |1        |NULL      |NULL        |\r\n|b          |NULL |2        |NULL      |NULL        |\r\n|a          |NULL |NULL     |a         |3           |\r\n|b          |NULL |NULL     |b         |2           |\r\n+-----------+-----+---------+----------+------------+\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change is for supporting initial state handling for integration with state data source reader.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. The user API is the same as prior PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45467 for initial state support without state data source reader.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test cases added in `TransformWithStateWithInitialStateSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are 2 bugs in the recently added new approach for RocksDB SST file mapping in this PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47875 (cc @sahnib )\r\n\r\n1. The file mapping version is not properly advancing and only advances when we are reopening the RocksDB. This causes ineffective file reuse and we end up not reusing files that should have been reused. Leading to a lot of unnecessary file upload/download, and in the worst case it will make us act like file reuse is disabled.\r\n\r\n2. Ineffective file reuse when creating a checkpoint. We currently will not reuse the files for creating checkpoint, if it was added in the current version i.e. if you do load(v1) -> save(v2), the SST files loaded in v1 will not be reused in v2, and we will upload them again.\r\n\r\n3. These two bugs were not caught even though we have tests to catch them, because there was also a bug in the test.\r\n\r\nNOTE: these bugs will not cause corruption and more of a performance bug. They just make file reuse ineffective. And end up working like there's no file reuse enabled. i.e. A lot of file upload/download \r\n\r\n**To Repro**:\r\nYou can add the test changes in this PR to current master and run RocksDB test, you will see test failures for file mapping version not advancing and for incorrect file reuse.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix. Without this change, it will work like file reuse is disabled. This is a performance bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests fixed and added assertion\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixing race condition in the test \"SPARK-46957: Migrated shuffle files should be able to cleanup from executor\" of `BlockManagerDecommissionIntegrationSuite`.\r\n\r\nThere are at least two race conditions in this test:\r\n\r\n1) The `SparkListener` is running in a different thread from the main thread of the unit test so `shuffleBlockUpdates` must be accessed from synchronised block.  For this `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` is used similarly to `taskEndEvents` in the `runDecomTest()` method. There was not reported error for this yet.\r\n\r\n2) The `SparkListener` is informed earlier about a removed executor than the block manager `stop()` is called/finished. So latter when the test recursively iterating over the files to find the shuffle files the block manager's `stop()` might be running and deleting the underlying files recursively via the disk block manager. This leads to `java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException`, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- SPARK-46957: Migrated shuffle files should be able to cleanup from executor *** FAILED ***\r\n18848  java.io.UncheckedIOException: java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: /home/runner/work/spark/spark/core/target/tmp/spark-87f59bc6-b996-42cd-9775-2f704b67f773/executor-e0a030d4-434b-46b3-bdbf-81d4908bb0f5/blockmgr-d88ed5dd-c1c8-4713-9433-10694e736a8e/3a\r\n18849  at java.base/java.nio.file.FileTreeIterator.fetchNextIfNeeded(FileTreeIterator.java:87)\r\n18850  at java.base/java.nio.file.FileTreeIterator.hasNext(FileTreeIterator.java:103)\r\n18851  at java.base/java.util.Iterator.forEachRemaining(Iterator.java:132)\r\n18852  at java.base/java.util.Spliterators$IteratorSpliterator.forEachRemaining(Spliterators.java:1939)\r\n18853  at java.base/java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.copyInto(AbstractPipeline.java:509)\r\n18854  at java.base/java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.wrapAndCopyInto(AbstractPipeline.java:499)\r\n18855  at java.base/java.util.stream.ReduceOps$ReduceOp.evaluateSequential(ReduceOps.java:921)\r\n18856  at java.base/java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.evaluate(AbstractPipeline.java:234)\r\n18857  at java.base/java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline.collect(ReferencePipeline.java:682)\r\n18858  at org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.toList(FileUtils.java:3025)\r\n18859  ...\r\n18860  Cause: java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: /home/runner/work/spark/spark/core/target/tmp/spark-87f59bc6-b996-42cd-9775-2f704b67f773/executor-e0a030d4-434b-46b3-bdbf-81d4908bb0f5/blockmgr-d88ed5dd-c1c8-4713-9433-10694e736a8e/3a\r\n18861  at java.base/sun.nio.fs.UnixException.translateToIOException(UnixException.java:92)\r\n18862  at java.base/sun.nio.fs.UnixException.rethrowAsIOException(UnixException.java:106)\r\n18863  at java.base/sun.nio.fs.UnixException.rethrowAsIOException(UnixException.java:111)\r\n18864  at java.base/sun.nio.fs.UnixFileAttributeViews$Basic.readAttributes(UnixFileAttributeViews.java:55)\r\n18865  at java.base/sun.nio.fs.UnixFileSystemProvider.readAttributes(UnixFileSystemProvider.java:171)\r\n18866  at java.base/sun.nio.fs.LinuxFileSystemProvider.readAttributes(LinuxFileSystemProvider.java:99)\r\n18867  at java.base/java.nio.file.Files.readAttributes(Files.java:1853)\r\n18868  at java.base/java.nio.file.FileTreeWalker.getAttributes(FileTreeWalker.java:226)\r\n18869  at java.base/java.nio.file.FileTreeWalker.visit(FileTreeWalker.java:277)\r\n18870  at java.base/java.nio.file.FileTreeWalker.next(FileTreeWalker.java:374)\r\n18871  ... \r\n```  \r\n\r\nTo address this issue the local directory used by the decommissioned executor was find out and the wait is changed from getting the `ExecutorRemoved` event  to  wait for  the delete of this directory to be finished. This way the directory tree walked after the delete.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n\r\nThe jira also mentions failures like:\r\n```\r\n[info] - SPARK-46957: Migrated shuffle files should be able to cleanup from executor *** FAILED *** (35 seconds, 200 milliseconds)\r\n15718[info]   0 was not greater than or equal to 4 (BlockManagerDecommissionIntegrationSuite.scala:423)\r\n15719[info]

`java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException` was  coming so it might be there are still something to fix even after this changes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs Maven daily test with Java 21 was failing from time to time (flaky because of the race condition).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by running the existing unit test repeatedly.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Both algorithms inherit the same LogFacBase class and are built under the same optimization backend. The first algorithm is an alternative to the well-known ALS: the key difference is that LMF uses a logistic loss function, while ALS uses a regression function. In most recommendation problems, the logistic loss function is better grounded in theory, so I am sure LMF will be useful to the community.\r\n\r\nThe second algorithm is actually a large-scale implementation of the SkipGram version of the Word2Vec algorithm with negative sampling. The key difference from the existing Word2Vec implementation in spark is that my proposed implementation allows to train models of any large size, while the existing one is limited by the size of 2Gb. I would like to note that this feature is vital in the area of recommendations, where the size of the inventory can exceed hundreds of millions of items.\r\n\r\nBoth algorithms implement the general gradient descent method for matrix factorizations. The key principle of the algorithm is as follows: each training epoch consists of n subiterations, where n is the number of partitions into which the embeddings and data are partitioned. The value of n should be chosen so that 1/n part of the embeddings fits into the memory of a single executor. Data and embeddings are partitioned using two hash functions, one for the first coordinate of the matrix to be decomposed, the second for the second. Thus one table of embeddings (user-side) is partitioned using the first hash function and the second (item-side) using the second hash function. The data is a set of user-item pairs. At each subiteration, only those pairs whose user-parity matches the item-parity are considered. The reason for this is that each executor loads the embeddings of its partition into memory, only user-item pairs for which both embeddings are present in memory can be processed. To process all user-item pairs, on each of the n subiterations of the item-side, the partition is cyclically shifted while the user-side remains fixed.\r\n\r\nAt each subiteration, each exequtor runs a local SGD learning process on its data. The key difficulty here is negative sampling for implicit approaches. To solve this problem we used the approach described in the paper [Distributed negative sampling for word embeddings](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10931/10790), the essence of which is that it is possible to sample negatives from the table of embeddings available at the executor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR targets at Spark Classic only. Spark Connect will be handled in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n`verifySchema` parameter of createDataFrame decides whether to verify data types of every row against schema.\r\n\r\nNow it only takes effect for with createDataFrame with\r\n- regular Python instances\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to make it work with createDataFrame with\r\n- `pyarrow.Table`\r\n- `pandas.DataFrame` with Arrow optimization\r\n- `pandas.DataFrame` without Arrow optimization\r\n\r\nBy default, `verifySchema` parameter is `pyspark._NoValue`, if not provided, createDataFrame with\r\n- `pyarrow.Table`,  **verifySchema = False**\r\n- `pandas.DataFrame` with Arrow optimization,  **verifySchema = spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely**\r\n- `pandas.DataFrame` without Arrow optimization, **verifySchema = True**\r\n-  regular Python instances, **verifySchema = True** (existing behavior)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change makes schema validation consistent across all formats, improving data integrity and helping prevent errors.\r\nIt also enhances flexibility by allowing users to choose schema verification regardless of the input type.\r\n\r\nPart of [SPARK-50146](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-50146).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSetup:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> import pandas as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make the majority of DSv1 streaming sources to carry over stream information from logical plan to physical plan, so that Spark can use the same approach of collecting metrics for DSv2 streaming sources.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, this PR introduces two new traits which are matching with logical node and physical node respectively:\r\n\r\n* Logical plan: StreamSourceAwareLogicalPlan\r\n* Physical plan: StreamSourceAwareSparkPlan\r\n\r\nAll streaming DSv1 sources are expected to produce the logical plan in getBatch(), which has leaf node(s) implementing StreamSourceAwareLogicalPlan. For built-in DSv1 streaming sources (and external sources using `SparkSession/SQLContext.internalCreateDataFrame`), they are mostly using one or multiple of nodes:\r\n\r\n* LogicalRDD\r\n* LocalRelation\r\n* LogicalRelation\r\n\r\nPhysical planning with LogicalRelation will be covered via either 1) RowDataSourceScanExec or 2) FileSourceScanExec. It may not cover all possible types of relations, but it's uneasy for both data source developers and users to extend the Spark planner to handle the additional case in physical planning. Furthermore, DSv2 is the standard interface for streaming sources for external sources. For others they are covered with static nodes, LogicalRDD -> RDDScanExec, LocalRelation -> LocalTableScanExec.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the progress reporter to collect the metrics from the nodes implementing StreamSourceAwareSparkPlan, which can be used across DSv1 and DSv2. To avoid regression, the progress reporter will check whether the executed plan has all streams we want to capture; if the executed plan misses some stream(s), the progress reporter will fall back to the old way.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor DSv2 data sources, the source nodes in the executed plan are always MicroBatchScanExec, and these nodes contain the stream information.\r\n\r\nBut for DSv1 data sources, the logical node and the physical node representing the scan of the source are technically arbitrary (any logical node and any physical node), hence Spark makes an assumption that the leaf nodes for initial logical plan <=> logical plan for batch N <=> physical plan for batch N are the same so that we can associate these nodes. This is fragile and we have non-trivial number of reports of broken metric.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified tests - some tests were based on limitation and these tests are fixed with this PR.\r\n\r\ne.g. org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.TriggerAvailableNowSuite\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-28T06:32:02Z","updated_at":"2024-11-05T01:29:04Z","closed_at":"2024-10-30T21:35:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87c8dc032dd47112e29c5885b50f65cf1d88e956","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr makes the following changes to the `maven-shade-plugin` rules for the `sql/core` module:\r\n\r\n1. To avoid being influenced by the parent `pom.xml`, use `combine.self = \"override\"` in the `<configuration>` of the `maven-shade-plugin` for the `sql/core` module. Before this configuration was added, the relocation result was incorrect, and `protobuf-java` was not relocated. We can unzip the packaging result to confirm this issue.\r\n\r\nWe can use IntelliJ's \"Show Effective POM\" feature to view the result of this parameter, the result is equivalent to the effective POM log with --debug printing added during the Maven compilation:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"828\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bce810f-57e9-4a50-9fa2-b6063e040a29\">\r\n\r\nWe can see that an unexpected \r\n```\r\n<includes>\r\n  <include>org.eclipse.jetty.**</include>\r\n</includes>\r\n```\r\n has been added to the relocation rule.\r\n\r\n**After** \r\n\r\n<img width=\"787\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fab3422-2da7-4b8f-bd7f-9357fcdc39c2\">\r\n\r\nWe can see that the extra `<includes>` in the relocation rule is no longer present.\r\n\r\n2. Before SPARK-48755 | https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47133 overwrote the `maven-shade-plugin` rules for `sql/core`, it inherited the rules from the parent `pom.xml` and shaded `org.spark-project.spark:unused`. This behavior changed after SPARK-48755, so this pr restores it.\r\n\r\n3. The relocation rules for Guava should be retained and follow the configuration in the parent `pom.xml`, which relocates `com.google.common` to `${spark.shade.packageName}.guava`. This PR restores this configuration.\r\n\r\n4. For `protobuf-java`, which is under the `com.google.protobuf` package, the already shaded `protobuf-java` in the `core` module can be reused instead of shading it again in `sql/core` module. Therefore, this pr only configures the corresponding relocation rule for it: `com.google.protobuf` -> `${spark.shade.packageName}.spark_core.protobuf`.\r\n\r\n5. Regarding the `ServicesResourceTransformer` configuration, it is used to merge `META-INF/services` resources. This is not needed for Guava and `protobuf-java`, so this pr removes it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix shade and relocation rule of `sql/core` module\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Aciton\r\n- Manually inspect the packaging result: Extract `spark-sql_2.13-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to a separate directory, then execute `grep \"org.sparkproject.guava\" -R *` and `grep \"org.sparkproject.spark_core.protobuf\" -R *` to confirm the successful relocation.\r\n- Maven test passed: https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/runs/32278520082\r\n\r\n<img width=\"960\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5435b2ff-3785-4413-83d9-190c16c6ba75\">\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to reset the expire timeout of the isolated session. during the tasks running.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo prevent removal of artifacts for long running tasks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. It fixes a bug. When users are running Python UDFs (or Scala UDF) for more than the specific timeout (30 minutes), and other tasks are submitted by other sessions - so the cache removal happens by Guava cache, it removes the artifact directory dedicated for the session.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested after taking the logic out. It's difficult to write a test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-26T06:39:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T21:55:38Z","closed_at":"2024-11-11T23:33:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17d14e02a529f2b185a96dc9796119b0c37e488b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ca947067abefc26bb24aad1a9012602d9106cf2f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-50118","ref":"SPARK-50118","sha":"ca947067abefc26bb24aad1a9012602d9106cf2f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds the following DataFrame APIs for subqueries to Spark Classic.\r\n\r\n- `scalar()`\r\n- `exists()`\r\n\r\nAlso, add `outer()` to `Column` to specify outer references.\r\n\r\n#### Examples:\r\n\r\nFor the following tables `l` and `r`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.table(\"l\").printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- a: long (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: double (nullable = true)\r\n\r\n>>> spark.table(\"r\").printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- c: long (nullable = true)\r\n |-- d: double (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as sf\r\n\r\n# select * from l where b < (select max(d) from r where a = c)\r\nspark.table(\"l\").where(\r\n    sf.col(\"b\")\r\n    < (\r\n        spark.table(\"r\")\r\n        .where(sf.col(\"a\").outer() == sf.col(\"c\"))\r\n        .select(sf.max(\"d\"))\r\n        .scalar()\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n\r\n# select a, (select sum(b) from l l2 where l2.a = l1.a) sum_b from l l1\r\nspark.table(\"l\").select(\r\n    \"a\",\r\n    (\r\n        spark.table(\"l\")\r\n        .where(sf.col(\"a\") == sf.col(\"a\").outer())\r\n        .select(sf.sum(\"b\"))\r\n        .scalar()\r\n        .alias(\"sum_b\")\r\n    ),\r\n)\r\n\r\n# select * from l where exists (select * from r where l.a = r.c)\r\nspark.table(\"l\").where(\r\n    spark.table(\"r\").where(sf.col(\"a\").outer() == sf.col(\"c\")).exists()\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSubquery APIs are missing in DataFrame API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, new DataFrame APIs for subqueries will be available.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-25T23:29:46Z","updated_at":"2024-11-20T13:43:32Z","closed_at":"2024-11-12T01:58:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e688123fcbd1957b54973bf6a545479dc437da89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d9a759740ea8cae87138ae44593152b54a7dfcc4","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-50130/scalar_exists","ref":"issues/SPARK-50130/scalar_exists","sha":"d9a759740ea8cae87138ae44593152b54a7dfcc4","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanging the way how the collation strength of string expressions are calculated. Currently, there are three different collation strengths:\r\n - explicit - result of the `collate` expression\r\n - implicit - column references and output of string functions\r\n - default - literals and cast expression\r\n\r\nHowever, unlike in other database systems (pg, sql server) collation strengths were not propagated up the expression tree, meaning that `substring('a' collate unicode), 0, 1)` would have implicit strength because it is the result of a string expression.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to change the behavior to be more in line with other systems mentioned above; and to do it by traversing the expression tree and propagating the highest precedence strengths up (explicit being the highest and default the lowest) while also finding the conflicts between them (conflicting explicit or implicit strenghts).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be more consistent with other systems that have collations (postgre, sql server etc.)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-25T20:04:05Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T09:39:05Z","closed_at":"2024-11-21T09:39:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e236e86b6ebfaf4e5cab68241fba053cfcecf6f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5a762d374f4a2ad21ac7eb218cf406f4d90498e3","head":{"label":"stefankandic:newCollationPrec-separate","ref":"newCollationPrec-separate","sha":"5a762d374f4a2ad21ac7eb218cf406f4d90498e3","user":{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":734708961,"node_id":"R_kgDOK8rE4Q","name":"spark","full_name":"stefankandic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic/spark","description":"Apache

exclusively to type hints.\r\n\r\nSimple test case:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Any, cast\r\nfrom pyspark.pandas import DataFrame\r\n\r\nfoo = cast(DataFrame, None).sort_index()\r\nbar

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a long-standing correctness bug for LIMIT/OFFSET. Spark has 3 execution paths for LIMIT:\r\n1. If LIMIT is the root node, use `CollectLimitExec` to eliminate the shuffle and get the first N records on the driver side.\r\n2. If there is a global sort under LIMIT, use `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec` to avoid a full sort using top-N algorithm\r\n3. Otherwise, use `GlobalLimitExec` to get the first N records via a single-partition shuffle.\r\n\r\nThe third execution path has a problem: Spark shuffle reader fetches shuffle blocks in random order and can't preserve the data ordering. It's usually OK when the data order doesn't matter, but the second execution path is not always picked because it has a trigger condition: the LIMIT N must be smaller than TOP_K_SORT_FALLBACK_THRESHOLD .\r\n\r\nThis bug is more likely to happen for OFFSET because it doesn't have the top-K optimization.\r\n\r\nAn ideal solution is to have an order preserving mode for the shuffle reader, which is non-trivial work. This PR proposes a workaround: add a local sort after the single-partition shuffle to restore the data ordering.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncorrectness fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now LIMIT/OFFSET with global sort can preserve the data ordering\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord
