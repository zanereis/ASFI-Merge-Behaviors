for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrent `columns` is implemented based on `limit` which runs a job to fetch data and get schema from the data collection. However a more efficient way is to call `schema` API which only need to analyze the plan without collect data. This approach should be more efficient in most of the cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nEfficiency\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38504.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where a unit test for SymlinkTextInputFormat would fail in JDK 11. The fix is to return the record reader directly instead of wrapping it with `HiveRecordReader`.\r\n\r\nThe issue could be reproduced by running a test right before SPARK-40815 tests with JDK 11 and appears to be related to `ExecMapper.getDone()` (https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-2.3/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/HiveRecordReader.java#L76). This check is for a static variable that is set when the map job is done to limit results. Note that there is no synchronisation around `getDone()` or `setDone()`, it is just a static mutable variable.\r\n\r\nOnce that is set, the record reader returns 0 records. I don't know why it works in JDK 8 but not in JDK 11 but my current suspicion is something related to class loader in JDK similar to this patch: https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/a234475faa2cab2606f2a74eb9ca071f006998e2 (maybe this is the fix but I was not able to verify).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRe-enables the test and fixes an issue with DelegateSymlinkTextInputFormat returning 0 records. Note that this is still an issue with SymlinkTextInputFormat as this needs to be addressed in Hive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI re-enabled the unit tests that used to fail in JDK 11 and extended a test to cover

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRevert https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4274fb8806c25519cac829d00b01132fe08c0cac\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI am starting a new project for storing live UI data in disk-based KVStore for higher UI retentions(e.g. storing more than 1000 SQL queries in live UI). \r\nThe new approach will be better than https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4274fb8806c25519cac829d00b01132fe08c0cac . The new configurations and listeners won't be needed. ThusI am having a revert before starting my project.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it is not released yet.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nCI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nConnect have marked the session parameter everywhere as `Optional`.  This seems to be only useful for testing where test case can ignore the session parameter when it is not applicable. \r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n1. There are PySpark DataFrame API that returns SparkSession which is not optional. If Connect keep it as optional then we will have diff on such API.\r\n2. Optional suggests `None` check which seems to not be necessary at many places (or forget to check `None` etc.)\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the `Optional` on the session from API interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMaintainability \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe now allow setting up `user_id` in `connection_string`, thus it could cause ambiguity when multiple candidates for `user_id` are provided in both `RemoteSparkSession` constructor and the connector_string.\r\n\r\n This PR proposes that we should enforce only one `user_id` is already provided, either through the constructor or `connection_string` of `RemoteSparkSession`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nReduce ambiguity when seeing multiple candidates for `user_id`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to assign the proper name `NUM_COLUMNS_MISMATCH ` to the legacy error class `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2429 `, and modify test suite to use `checkError()` which checks the error class name, context and etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProper name improves user experience w/ Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes an user-facing error message. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DataFrameSetOperationsSuite\"\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-11-07T17:54:11Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T20:26:00Z","closed_at":"2022-11-08T20:26:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e55143f1d529f341da4fd01fc8917718e0d461d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38537/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38537/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38537/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5913cba1c5a5dcba414b99b91621884dac8f29e7","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:columns-num-mismatch","ref":"columns-num-mismatch","sha":"5913cba1c5a5dcba414b99b91621884dac8f29e7","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims replace `FRAME_LESS_OFFSET_WITHOUT_FOLDABLE` with `NON_FOLDABLE_INPUT` to clean up similar error subclass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`FRAME_LESS_OFFSET_WITHOUT_FOLDABLE` and `NON_FOLDABLE_INPUT` look similar, but `NON_FOLDABLE_INPUT` is more general\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The PR changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\nFor example, the error message will change from \r\n\r\n```\r\nOffset expression \"(- nonfoldableliteral())\\\" must be a literal.\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\nthe input offset should be a foldable \"INT\" expression; however, got \"(- nonfoldableliteral())\\\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass Github

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr change to use a more appropriate constructor when the input is `ArrayBuffer` or `Empty Collection` to improve the construction performance of `GenericArrayData` with Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMinor performance improvement.\r\n\r\n`GenericArrayData ` has the following constructor\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/57d492556768eb341f525ce7eb5c934089fa9e7e/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/util/GenericArrayData.scala#L30\r\n\r\nWhen the input type is `ArrayBuffer`, the following code is similar in Spark\r\n\r\n```\r\nnew GenericArrayData(arrayBuffer.toSeq)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Scala 2.12, there will be no performance gap between `new GenericArrayData(arrayBuffer.toSeq)` and `new GenericArrayData(arrayBuffer)`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Scala 2.13 is used, there will be a performance gap, because 'toSeq' will cause a redundant memory copy.\r\n\r\nFor the following test case:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n val valuesPerIteration: Long = 1000 * 1000 * 10\r\n val buffer = if (bufferSize == 0) {\r\n    ArrayBuffer.empty[Any]\r\n  } else {\r\n    ArrayBuffer.fill[Any](bufferSize)(() => 1)\r\n  }\r\n  val benchmark = new Benchmark(s\"constructor with buffer size = $bufferSize\",\r\n    valuesPerIteration, output = output)\r\n  benchmark.addCase(\"toSeq and construct\") { _ =>\r\n    var n = 0\r\n    while (n < valuesPerIteration) {\r\n      new GenericArrayData(buffer.toSeq)\r\n      n += 1\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  benchmark.addCase(\"construct directly\") { _ =>\r\n    var n = 0\r\n    while (n < valuesPerIteration) {\r\n      new GenericArrayData(buffer)\r\n      n += 1\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen bufferSize=10, there is a performance gap of more than 5 times between a and b, and the performance gap increases almost linearly with the increase of bufferSize\r\n\r\nThere will be more than 5 times performance gap between `new GenericArrayData(buffer.toSeq)` and `new GenericArrayData(buffer)` when `bufferSize = 10` and the performance gap will increase with the increase of bufferSize.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_345-b01 on Linux 5.15.0-1022-azure\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8370C CPU @ 2.80GHz\r\nconstructor with buffer size = 10:        Best Time(ms)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce new interface `ValidateOffsetRange`/`ComparableOffset`.\r\n\r\n> ValidateOffsetRange\r\n\r\nA mix-in of streaming SparkDataStream interface to indicate MicroBatchExecution to perform offset range validation. Sources which want to perform the validation \"conditionally\" should override the method `shouldValidate`.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface ValidateOffsetRange {\r\n  default boolean shouldValidate() { return true; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> ComparableOffset\r\n\r\nA mix-in of streaming Offset interface to implement comparison between two offset instances. The new interface can be mixed-in with both DSv1 streaming Offset and DSv2 streaming Offset.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface ComparableOffset {\r\n  enum CompareResult {\r\n    EQUAL,\r\n    GREATER,\r\n    LESS,\r\n    UNDETERMINED,\r\n    NOT_COMPARABLE\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  CompareResult compareTo(ComparableOffset other);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the source implements ValidateOffsetRange and requests MicroBatchExecution to do the validation, the offset instance must implement ComparableOffset. Otherwise MicroBatchExecution will throw error.\r\n\r\nThis PR also implements this interface for streaming offset in built-in data sources. For Kafka data source, the validation will be disabled when failOnLoss option is enabled, because failOnLoss allows the error case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark doesn't do any assertion against offsets and data source implementation is full of responsibility to validate the offset. It seems more useful to provide the offset validation by Spark rather than just documenting the responsibility and let data source implementation do the duty.\r\n\r\nThis offset validation is more important since we have Trigger.AvailableNow which gradually increases the offset and terminates when the offset is equal to the desired offset.

When spark apps encounter too old resource version from k8s, executor pods watcher will be close unexpected. After watcher closed, executors snapshotsStore can not continue update, this means app unable to get executors pod status in time. Thus, we should be restart watcher after abnormal shutdown. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRunning spark-submit to a k8s

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an update of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29178 which was closed because the root cause of the error was just vaguely defined there but here I will give an explanation why `HiveHBaseTableInputFormat` does not work well with the `NewHadoopRDD` (see in the next section). \r\n\r\nThe PR modify `TableReader.scala` to create `OldHadoopRDD` when input format is 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HiveHBaseTableInputFormat'. \r\n\r\n- environments (Cloudera distribution 7.1.7.SP1)：\r\nhadoop 3.1.1 \r\nhive 3.1.300\r\nspark 3.2.1

Each of the entry points used by the MapReduce framework,\r\n   * {@link #createRecordReader(InputSplit, TaskAttemptContext)} and {@link #getSplits(JobContext)},\r\n   * will call {@link #initialize(JobContext)} as a convenient centralized location to handle\r\n   * retrieving the necessary configuration information and calling\r\n   * {@link #initializeTable(Connection, TableName)}. Subclasses should implement their initialize\r\n   * call such that it is safe to call multiple times. The current TableInputFormatBase\r\n   * implementation relies on a non-null table reference to decide if an initialize call is needed,\r\n   * but this behavior may change in the future. In particular, it is critical that initializeTable\r\n   * not be called multiple times since this will leak Connection instances.\r\n   */\r\n  protected void initialize(JobContext context) throws IOException {\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not overridden by Hive and hard to reason why we need that (its an internal Hive class) so it is easier to fix this in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to invoke `AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis()` instead of `CheckAnalysis.failAnalysis()` because the first one captures the query context and passes it to `AnalysisException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo provide additional info as a query context to users. This should improve user experience with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38379. On second thought, if the canonicalized `Add` has a different type, casting it as the original data type can still match more semantically equivalent `Add`s \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nA better solution for the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40903. We can avoid regressions on marking on certain semantically equivalent `Add`s as not equivalent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nToday, Spark does column pruning in 3 steps:\r\n1. The rule `PushDownPredicates` pushes down `Filter`s as closer to the scan node as possible.\r\n2. The rule `ColumnPruning` generates `Project` below many operators, to prune columns before evaluating these operators. One exception is `Filter`. We do not generate `Project` below `Filter` as it conflicts with `PushDownPredicates`.\r\n3. After the above 2 steps, we should have a plan pattern like `Project(..., Filter(..., Relation))`, and we have rules (DS v1 and v2 have different rules) to match this pattern using `PhysicalOperation`, then apply filter pushdown and column pruning.\r\n\r\nThis works fine in most cases, but we can not always combine adjacent `Filter`s into one, due to non-deterministic predicates. For example, `Project(a, Filter(rand() > 0.5, Filter(rand() < 0.8), Relation)))`. `PhysicalOperation` can only match `Filter(rand() < 0.8), Relation)` and we can't do column pruning today.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem by adding a variant of `PhysicalOperation`: `ScanOperation`. It keeps all the adjacent `Filter`s, so that it can match more plan patterns and do column pruning better. The caller sides are also updated to restore the `Filter`s w.r.t. to their original order in the query plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocumentation of method `applyInPandas` for grouby and cogroup should mention in the main description that there are two allowed signatures for the provided function. The Examples state that this is possible, and the parameters sections states that for cogroup.\r\n\r\nAlso type information for `PandasCogroupedMapFunction` should mention the three-argument callable alternative.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBetter documenting these alternative to find this piece of information quicker.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUntested","created_at":"2022-11-04T10:26:40Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T11:17:37Z","closed_at":"2022-11-08T11:17:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b542906a24e455f888195080d433b3df6c4b804d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38509/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38509/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38509/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ba2ec4271ab00eb5d551b8c8a6e5b8d7f043001","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-pyspark-group-and-cogroup-doc-and-typing","ref":"branch-pyspark-group-and-cogroup-doc-and-typing","sha":"3ba2ec4271ab00eb5d551b8c8a6e5b8d7f043001","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs a followup to [SPARK-40925], [github PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38405), Remove corresponding checks in UnsupportedOperationChecker so that customers don't have to explicitly add new conf withSQLConf(\"spark.sql.streaming.unsupportedOperationCheck\" -> \"false\") to use the new multi-stateful operators. In other words we are enabling multi-stateful operators by default.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect, the API of `checkStreamingQueryGlobalWatermarkLimit(LogicalPlan, OutputMode)` is also changed to `checkStreamingQueryGlobalWatermarkLimit(LogicalPlan)` \r\n\r\nNew tests are added to `MultiStatefulOperatorsSuite.scala`, but I could also add equivalent ones to `UnsupportedOperationsSuite.scala` if requested. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo enable new multiple-stateful operators by default. Right now users need to set SQL conf `unsupportedOperationCheck` to false explicitly, which also disables many other useful checks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. All current running queries won't be impacted. But new queries could use chained stateful operators.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe add a hint field to the `SubqueryExpression` class, pull hints in subqueries into the hint field during `EliminateResolvedHint` and propagate this hint to joins formed from the subquery in `RewritePredicateSubquery`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, if a user tries to specify a query like the following, the hints on the subquery won't be respected.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM target t WHERE EXISTS\r\n(SELECT /*+ BROADCAST */ * FROM source s WHERE s.key = t.key)\r\n```\r\nThis happens as hints are removed from the plan and pulled into joins in the beginning of the optimization stage, but subqueries are only turned into joins during optimization. As we remove any hints that are not below a join, we end up removing hints that are below a subquery. \r\n\r\nIt worked prior to a refactoring that added hints as a field to joins ([SPARK-26065](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26065)) and can cause a regression if someone made use of hints on subqueries before.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Hints on subqueries will now work.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUTs to check whether hints are correctly propagated to joins formed from subqueries.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-03T10:33:17Z","updated_at":"2022-11-18T13:50:13Z","closed_at":"2022-11-18T13:50:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba1f564e53caa0c77908146321d3978bff2be9e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38497/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38497/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38497/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d339fe01e4bb548238074bca6b9a505f73984e6a","head":{"label":"fred-db:hint-propagation-40999","ref":"hint-propagation-40999","sha":"d339fe01e4bb548238074bca6b9a505f73984e6a","user":{"login":"fred-db","id":112404801,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrMpQQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112404801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db","html_url":"https://github.com/fred-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":560947292,"node_id":"R_kgDOIW9gXA","name":"spark","full_name":"fred-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fred-db","id":112404801,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrMpQQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112404801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db","html_url":"https://github.com/fred-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fred-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe change `CommandResult` to extend `LeafCommand` (which extends `Command`) instead of `LeafNode`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe want `CommandResult`, the logical plan node that stores the results from a command, to still be considered a command, rather than e.g. a query. This allows `CommandResult` to pass various checks for commands (such as [this one](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f4ff2d16483f7da2c7ab73c7cfec75bb9e91064d/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/CTESubstitution.scala#L54-L57)).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn spark-shell, before the change:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"ALTER TABLE t1 SET TBLPROPERTIES ('key'

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the connection string for Spark Connect clients according to the documentation added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38470. \r\n\r\nWith this patch it becomes possible to connect to a Spark Connect endpoint using\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark = SparkRemoteSession(user_id=\"martin\", connection_string=\"sc://hostname/;use_ssl=true;token=abcd\")\r\nspark.read.table(\"test\").limit(10).toPandas()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe connection string is properly parsed and filtered. This allows to dynamically configure SSL and bearer token authentication. All remaining parameters are converted into GRPC Metadata pairs and submitted as part of the request.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUser experience.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, experimental API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to assign the proper name `INVALID_IDENTIFIER ` to the legacy error class `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_0040 `, and modify test suite to use `checkError()` which checks the error class name, context and etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProper name improves user experience w/ Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes an user-facing error message. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n[For setting `partitionColumn, lowerBound, upperBound` in JDBC data source](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-jdbc.html), it'd better to have a code example to guide users for how to use it. Other sections are having code examples, so we'd better add it for these options as well.\r\n\r\nThe added example is from our own error message - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/jdbc/JDBCOptions.scala#L141-L148 .\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBetter user documentation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the documentation itself.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nVerified the documentation rendered as expected.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1195\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-02

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport DataFrame creation from 2d NumPy array with arbitrary columns.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, DataFrame creation from 2d ndarray works only with 2 columns. We should provide complete support for DataFrame creation with 2d ndarray. \r\n\r\nAs part of [SPARK-39405](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39405).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds documentation to describe how clients should implement handling \r\nconnecting to the Spark Connect endpoint. GRPC as a protocol is well documented and has\r\nmany options. However, this does not make it easy for users to reason about how to correctly\r\nconfigure GRPC to make it work for their use cases. \r\n\r\nTo overcome the issue, this document defines a client connection string that needs to be parsed\r\nby the different language clients and can be used to properly configure the GRPC client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocumentation and design specification for clients implementing the Spark Connect protocol.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nDoc only.","created_at":"2022-11-01T16:07:19Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T00:37:11Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T00:37:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6abd1742e37338df835fe12ff797053349960dda","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a1472e2a3f15b8bcedc7aa2e0c119cdf7901a156","head":{"label":"grundprinzip:client-connection","ref":"client-connection","sha":"a1472e2a3f15b8bcedc7aa2e0c119cdf7901a156","user":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503900825,"node_id":"R_kgDOHgjqmQ","name":"spark","full_name":"grundprinzip/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`BlockManager#removeBlockInternal` should ensure the lock is unlocked gracefully.\r\n`removeBlockInternal` tries to call `removeBlock` in the finally block.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the driver submits a job, `DAGScheduler` calls `sc.broadcast(taskBinaryBytes)`.\r\n`TorrentBroadcast#writeBlocks` may fail due to disk problems during `blockManager#putBytes`.\r\n`BlockManager#doPut` calls `BlockManager#removeBlockInternal` to clean up the block.\r\n`BlockManager#removeBlockInternal` calls `DiskStore#remove` to clean up blocks on disk.\r\n`DiskStore#remove` will try to create the directory because the directory does not exist, and an exception will be thrown at this time.\r\n`BlockInfoManager#blockInfoWrappers` block info and lock not removed.\r\nThe catch block in `TorrentBroadcast#writeBlocks` will call `blockManager.removeBroadcast` to clean up the broadcast.\r\nBecause the block lock in `BlockInfoManager#blockInfoWrappers` is not released, the `dag-scheduler-event-loop` thread of `DAGScheduler` will wait forever.\r\n\r\n```\r\n22/11/01 18:27:48 WARN BlockManager: Putting block

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make the manual tests for `DataFrame.corrwith` back into formal approach, if the pandas version is not 1.5.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere was a regression introduced by pandas 1.5.0 (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/48826), and seems it's resolved now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe fixed test should pass the CI.","created_at":"2022-11-01T01:56:03Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:44:33Z","closed_at":"2022-11-01T06:23:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0b057a82e92dc8e6e1b8da070d498741f4b5ab5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to migrate `failAnalysis()` errors without a context onto temporary error classes with the prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_24xx`. The error message will not include the error classes, so, in this way we will preserve the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe migration on temporary error classes allows to gather statistics about errors and detect most popular error classes. After that we could prioritise the work on migration.\r\n\r\nThe new error class name prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` proposed here kind of marks the error as developer-facing, not user-facing. Developers can still get the error class programmatically via the `SparkThrowable` interface, so that they can build error infra with it. End users won't see the error class in the message. This allows us to do the error migration very quickly, and we can refine the error classes and mark them as user-facing later (naming them properly, adding tests, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The error messages should be almost the same by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-10-31T21:04:09Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T13:24:52Z","closed_at":"2022-11-01T13:24:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3cdf84e4c274c866aad3fd9ce2a0d57ded2d320f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d3ddd0c37829cc95d9d20e84a3d1cb3b109bb19","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:legacy-error-class-failAnalysis-2","ref":"legacy-error-class-failAnalysis-2","sha":"7d3ddd0c37829cc95d9d20e84a3d1cb3b109bb19","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changed to resolve the JDBC Relation schema with PreparedStatement.executeQuery() instead of PreparedStatement.getMetaData(). The main changes are:\r\n1. Add a new function: getQueryOutputSchema() to JdbcDialect. By default, it will use getMetaData() to resolve schema.\r\n2. For 3 JDBC dialects: H2Dialect, MsSqlServerDialect and MySqlDialect, override this function to use executeQuery() to resolve the schema because they doesn't support getMetaData() well.\r\n3. Add 2 utility functions to JdbcUtils for the 2 ways to resolving schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. getMetaData() is better performance compared with executeQuery() because\r\n   getMetaData() only needs to compile the Query, but executeQuery() needs to execute the query.\r\n2. Move the schema resolution to JdbcDialect, make it possible to resolve schema differently for each database.\r\n    In the future, spark can support some non-SELECT query such as CALL PROC, etc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested with existing test
