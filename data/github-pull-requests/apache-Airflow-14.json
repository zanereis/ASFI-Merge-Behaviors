I saw that our project has `pandas` as a transtivie dependency due to [`apache-airflow-providers-databricks`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-databricks/stable/index.html) having it listed as a dependency. Upon inspection of the code, it seems it is only listed as a dependency, but not it does not seem to actually be used in the codebase:\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜  databricks git:(main) pwd\r\n/Users/florian/git/airflow/providers/src/airflow/providers/databricks\r\n\r\n➜  databricks git:(main) grep -r \"pandas\" .     \r\n./CHANGELOG.rst:* ``Update pandas minimum requirement for Python 3.12 (#40272)``\r\n./provider.yaml:  - pandas>=2.1.2,<2.2;python_version>=\"3.9\"\r\n./provider.yaml:  - pandas>=1.5.3,<2.2;python_version<\"3.9\"\r\n\r\n➜  databricks git:(main) grep -r \"pyarrow\" .\r\n./provider.yaml:  - pyarrow>=14.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the same holds for `pyarrow`. I assume this means the dependencies are not needed? I am not familiar with Airflow's codebase, so apologies in advance if I am overlooking something here. I did find some explanation about cross-dependencies with other providers packages, and the `generated/provider_dependencies.json` file, but not quite sure if that applies here. In any case; feel free to close this PR if you think it is not valid.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull

users try to access an inlet/outlet event with the asset object, it tries to fetch the asset that matches both the name and URI.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        @task(outlets=[Asset(name=\"example\",

part of AIP-72, this PR introduces proper signal handling for the supervisor process. The supervisor now intercepts `SIGTERM` signals to ensure that child processes (task processes) are terminated gracefully.\r\n\r\nWithout signal handling, terminating the supervisor process (e.g., via `kill -TERM`) could leave child processes running as orphaned tasks. This change ensures that when the supervisor is stopped, all managed subprocesses are also terminated cleanly.\r\n\r\nSample Output when Superviser receives SIGTERM with (`kill -TERM 138`):\r\n```\r\n2024-12-09 09:28:53 [debug    ] DAG file parsed                [task] [task] file=/files/dags/example_bash_operator.py\r\n2024-12-09 09:28:53 [warning  ] BashOperator.execute cannot be called outside TaskInstance!

now, when task gets cleared via UI, and dag run gets scheduled again, the OpenLineage integration will emit the event with same OL run_id as in the first execution.

runs.","created_at":"2024-12-03T16:03:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-11T19:43:51Z","closed_at":"2024-12-07T12:23:48Z","merged_at":"2024-12-07T12:23:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"e26909df6af86cc18a272d993ad45ab17dfa333a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5182284957,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABNONknQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:openlineage","name":"provider:openlineage","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AIP-53"}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/44617/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/44617/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/44617/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c949efa754f9ae12c7c5c6ff3a49a5249d4a06f8","head":{"label":"apache:clear-run-id","ref":"clear-run-id","sha":"c949efa754f9ae12c7c5c6ff3a49a5249d4a06f8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

point of this helper is to make it simpler to figure out what airflow version is installed, in particular to implement conditional logic in providers.\r\n\r\nCurrently the logic is too complicated and this has resulted in the proliferation of sort of redundant constants.  Here's an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow import __version__ as AIRFLOW_VERSION\r\n\r\nAIRFLOW_V_3_0_PLUS = Version(Version(AIRFLOW_VERSION).base_version) >= Version(\"3.0.0\")\r\nif AIRFLOW_V_3_0_PLUS:\r\n    from airflow.sdk.definitions.asset import Asset\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this helper, we can do this instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow import get_airflow_version\r\n\r\nif get_airflow_version() > Version(\"3.0.0\"):\r\n    from airflow.sdk.definitions.asset import Asset\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can't make use of this helper in providers until they are bumped to min airflow

The client then sends it to the task execution interface over HTTP. It send a POST request with the received body. The key isn't stripped off but is sent in the payload even though the server doesn't serialise it.\r\nThe client receives a response {\"message\": \"XCom successfully set\"} if all's good.\r\nIt passes this response back down to the supervisor which then writes it in the buffer.\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\nSince end to end isn't possible, the test case https://github.com/apache/airflow/compare/main...astronomer:airflow:AIP72-set-xcom-tasksdk?expand=1#diff-f55b9ba6be46de22b2838085bf1e0aa4193797c3ff7d0cdc4e06a626c96df1baR693-R713 checks for supervisor side of things, if supervisor processes \"request\" of correct format correctly. Checks for call args, responses, even buffer.\r\n\r\nThe test https://github.com/apache/airflow/compare/main...astronomer:airflow:AIP72-set-xcom-tasksdk?expand=1#diff-048659c5ed2897cd0ed24a340885d5950c964ea451ccc359e1ab592bf8a59f0dR138-R165 checks if the client

Disable pagination since tasks and task instances doesn't support limit or pagination.\r\n2. Colors are slightly off with `stateColor` and the theme which will be fixed overall. Please let me know if I am missing some other configuration.\r\n3. The historical view of the task instances which is the last column in the card view is using list task instances endpoint which returns like 100 task instances and the limit is easily reached with 14 task instances per task. All task instance attributes are also not used with only start_date, end_date, try_number, duration and state used which could be fetched efficiently.\r\n4.

PR ports the overtime feature on `LocalTaskJob` (added in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39890) to the Supervisor. It allows the Task process to terminate when it is exceeding the configured overtime threshold which is useful when we add Listenener to the Task process.\r\n\r\nThe overtime configured here applies to all states not just success, as was the case with LTJ.\r\n\r\ncloses https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44356\r\n\r\nAlso added `TaskState` to update state and send end_date from task process to the supervisor.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

need to install `eval-type-backport` to avoid problems with Pydantic 2.10.+ released in November 2024 for python 3.8 and 3.9. While Pydantic 2.10.0/2.10.1 completely broke Airflow 2 installation and Pydantic 2.10.2 fixed the issue for past versions of Airflow, there are still Some Typing constructs that are not handled well by Pydantic and in case Pydantic fails with those errors, it will STILL fall back to `eval-type-backport` to handle those cases (if if `eval-type-backport` is installed. Therefore - until we have Airflow 2.10.3 for backwards compatibility tests and we attempt to install \"edge\" provider that might use such breaking constructs, we need to install `eval-type-backport` to avoid problems with Pydantic 2.10.2+ as well. As soon as we move to Airflow 2.10.4, we can remove this workaround because Airflow 2.10.4 adds \"eval-type-backport\" as a dependency and it will be installed automatically.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#39546\r\n\r\n## Add service account impersonation with Cloud SQL Proxy and version compatibility\r\n\r\n### **Summary of Changes:**\r\n* Added service account impersonation support for Cloud SQL Proxy operations\r\n\r\n 1. Single service account impersonation via impersonation_chain parameter\r\n 2. Service account chain impersonation for delegated access\r\n 3. Proper credential parameter handling and validation\r\n \r\n* Updated Cloud SQL Proxy version support\r\n 1. Added v2 parameter format support (--impersonate-service-account)\r\n 2. Maintained v1 backward compatibility (-impersonate-service-account)\r\n 3. Added version detection and parameter format handling\r\n \r\n**Testing and Validation:** \r\n1. Added unit tests for CloudSQLCreateInstanceOperator with impersonation \r\n2. Added tests for CloudSqlProxyRunner parameter handling \r\n3. Added version-specific command line parameter tests \r\n4. Added impersonation chain validation tests \r\n5. All tests passing under providers/tests/google/cloud/hooks/test_cloud_sql.py & providers/tests/google/cloud/operators/test_cloud_sql.py\r\n\r\n**Documentation Updates:** \r\n1. Updated class docstrings with impersonation details \r\n2. Added version compatibility information \r\n3. Added usage examples for both single SA and chain impersonation\r\n\r\n**Use Case:** \r\n\r\nEnables teams in shared Google Cloud Composer environments to access Cloud SQL databases through project-specific service accounts via impersonation, similar to other Google Cloud operators. \r\n\r\nIssue Reference: Closes #39546 \r\n\r\n**Example Usage:** \r\n\r\n```python \r\n\r\n# Using v2 with single service account \r\n\r\nrunner = CloudSqlProxyRunner( path_prefix=\"test\", instance_specification=\"proj:region:instance\", impersonation_chain=\"sa@project.iam\", sql_proxy_version=\"v2.0.0\" ) \r\n\r\n# Using v1 with impersonation chain \r\n\r\nrunner = CloudSqlProxyRunner( path_prefix=\"test\", instance_specification=\"proj:region:instance\", impersonation_chain=[\"sa1@proj.iam\", \"sa2@proj.iam\"], sql_proxy_version=\"v1.0.0\" ) \r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-02T10:15:42Z","updated_at":"2025-02-01T12:18:31Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

The supervisor would receive a request from the task runner to CREATE / PUT a variable.\r\n2. The `handle_request` method handles this part and is responsible to send a request to the API client to send it to the tas execution interface.\r\n3. In this case, `PutVariable` is the body that will be passed down to the api client.\r\n\r\n#### API Client\r\n1. The client receives a request from the supervisor to CREATE / PUT a variable. The client then sends it to the task execution interface over HTTP. It send a put request with the received body. The key isn't stripped off but is sent in the payload even though the server doesn't serialise it.\r\n2. The client receives a response `{\"message\": \"Variable successfully set\"}` if all's good.\r\n3. It passes this response back down to the supervisor which then writes it in the buffer.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n1. Since end to end isn't possible, the test case https://github.com/apache/airflow/compare/main...astronomer:airflow:AIP72-set-variable-task-sdk?expand=1#diff-f55b9ba6be46de22b2838085bf1e0aa4193797c3ff7d0cdc4e06a626c96df1baR693-R704 checks for supervisor side of things, if supervisor processes \"request\" of correct format correctly. Checks for call args, responses, even buffer.\r\n2. The test https://github.com/apache/airflow/compare/main...astronomer:airflow:AIP72-set-variable-task-sdk?expand=1#diff-048659c5ed2897cd0ed24a340885d5950c964ea451ccc359e1ab592bf8a59f0dR138-R154 checks if the client can handle requests of type `PutVariable` properly and respond accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

one for https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42317.\r\n\r\nThe command is designed for \"given an asset, do what you need to do to make it emit an event\". The procedure is\r\n\r\n1. Find a DAG that has a task that defines the asset as outlet.\r\n2. Trigger that DAG.\r\n3. Return the scheduled DAG run.\r\n\r\nCurrently we error out if more than one DAG defines the asset as outlet. This is arguably bad practice anyway, but this may make some sense if the DAGs have dependency between them? We'll figure this out when someone thinks of a use case.\r\n\r\nI have some doubts returning a DAG run from this. Intuitively we should have more of a distinction? There's no good alternative though; the closest thing we have related to assets is AssetEvent, but that does not get created *after* the DAG run finishes, and we don't want to block until then. DAG run is the only reasonable thing to return here. I guess we could wrap it? We still have a chance to change it before 3.0 is released.\r\n\r\nAlso, I needed to add a bunch of session management to trigger_dag so the same session is passed down correctly. Previously, trigger_dag always create a DagRun object detached to a session because it creates its own session that only lives inside the function. This causes an issue when we serialize it into a Pydantic model since it can no longer access the related fields.","created_at":"2024-12-02T07:43:47Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T07:13:23Z","closed_at":"2024-12-03T07:13:22Z","merged_at":"2024-12-03T07:13:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"3505f9ab8c9c39985a64285fad5742407793db44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1937475224,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3NDc1MjI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:API","name":"area:API","color":"efe07c","default":false,"description":"Airflow's

`handle_failure`, `TaskInstance.save_to_db` not only updates state of that task instance, it also pushes stale DagRun state - the one it got on TI start. So the actual DR state goes `running` -> `failed` -> `running` -> `failed`. \r\n\r\nThis causes other unintended behavior, such as calling `on_dag_run_failed` listeners twice. \r\n\r\nThe solution just loads DR state from db before pushing TI state. However, there probably is better solution, that someone with more knowledge of SQLAlchemy might help with. \r\n\r\nLink to discussion on Airflow slack:

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44311#discussion_r1862825630 @kaxil, @potiuk and me had a bit of discussion. As promised to come back with this, this PR implements (as promised) a way to make the retries in Edge worker configurable.\r\n\r\nBut it is also opening the box of debates because:\r\n\r\n- Do we want to add a new config? (Some people start screaming?)\r\n    - (My position: Sensible default and make it configurable)\r\n- Should we really retry 10 times?\r\n    - (My position: 10 attempts was the former default in internal API, in a small prod outage I can say at least this is good such that tasks do not fail in small webserver outages or connection interrupts. We see daily flakiness on our WAN. As Zombie threshold is at 300s per default retrying more than 5min might not be needed. But also we should faster on small glitches... so the exponential back-off is good. I tested with the parameters below and I think for waiting 5min max it is reasonable to test 10 times in between before fail.\r\n- Oh, why specific in Edge? (I saw multiple occasions in retries in different places in the repo. But also moving to TaskSDK I think we also should consider making this more common - at least Edge API retries from far away should be matching to the calls that are made to TaskSDK!)\r\n    - (My position: I'd favor to make such setting common in Edge API and at least TaskSDK calls)\r\n\r\n@ashb would also call for your opinion.\r\n\r\nAnd if needed - but I assume it can be made within this PR - we could also call for an open [DISCUSS] or loop-in other stakeholders. Le me know.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 28.12.2024: Updated after merge of
