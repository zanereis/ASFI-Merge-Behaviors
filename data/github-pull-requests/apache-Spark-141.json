What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the case when an user specifies the corrupt record column via the CSV option `columnNameOfCorruptRecord`:\r\n1. Disable the column pruning feature in the CSV parser.\r\n2. Don't push filters to `UnivocityParser` that refer to the \"virtual\" column `columnNameOfCorruptRecord`. Since the column cannot present in the input CSV, user's queries fail while compiling predicates. After the changes, the skipped filters are applied later on the upper layer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes allow to refer to the corrupt record column from user's queries:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nspark.read.format(\"csv\")\r\n  .option(\"header\", \"true\")\r\n  .option(\"columnNameOfCorruptRecord\", \"corrRec\")\r\n  .schema(schema)\r\n  .load(\"csv_corrupt_record.csv\")\r\n  .filter($\"corrRec\".isNotNull)\r\n  .show()\r\n```\r\nfor the input file \"csv_corrupt_record.csv\":\r\n```\r\n0,2013-111_11 12:13:14\r\n1,1983-08-04 \r\n```\r\nthe query returns:\r\n```\r\n+---+----+----------------------+\r\n|a  |b   |corrRec               |\r\n+---+----+----------------------+\r\n|0  |null|0,2013-111_11 12:13:14|\r\n+---+----+----------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the changes, the query above fails with the exception:\r\n```Java\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: _corrupt_record does not exist. Available: a, b\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType.$anonfun$fieldIndex$1(StructType.scala:310) ~[classes/:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new CSV test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *.CSVv1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *.CSVv2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *.CSVLegacyTimeParserSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid developers from accidentally adding those files when working on parser/lexer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTo make sure those files are ignored by `git status` when they exist.","created_at":"2022-03-14T02:50:14Z","updated_at":"2022-05-09T14:43:23Z","closed_at":"2022-03-17T09:12:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ca2a4426fcd1198f70366ac9852b5717174d4653","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8e0ccee25cd67a57073f3ff8f627f917f2ba873f","head":{"label":"yutoacts:minor_gitignore","ref":"minor_gitignore","sha":"8e0ccee25cd67a57073f3ff8f627f917f2ba873f","user":{"login":"yutoacts","id":87687356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3Njg3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87687356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts","html_url":"https://github.com/yutoacts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":389853660,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODk4NTM2NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"yutoacts/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yutoacts","id":87687356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3Njg3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87687356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts","html_url":"https://github.com/yutoacts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yutoacts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yutoacts/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen building the project list from an aggregate sequence in `ExtractGenerator`, convert the aggregate sequence to an `IndexedSeq` before performing the flatMap operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis query fails with a `NullPointerException`:\r\n```\r\nval df = Seq(1, 2, 3).toDF(\"v\")\r\ndf.select(Stream(explode(array(min($\"v\"), max($\"v\"))), sum($\"v\")): _*).collect\r\n```\r\nIf you change `Stream` to `Seq`, then it succeeds.\r\n\r\n`ExtractGenerator` uses a flatMap operation over `aggList` for two purposes:\r\n\r\n- To produce a new aggregate list\r\n- to update `projectExprs` (which is initialized as an array of nulls).\r\n\r\nWhen `aggList` is a `Stream`, the flatMap operation evaluates lazily, so all entries in `projectExprs` after the first will still be null when the rule completes.\r\n\r\nChanging `aggList` to an `IndexedSeq` forces the flatMap to evaluate eagerly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUnsafeHashedRelation should serialize numKeys out\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOne case I found was this:\r\nWe turned on ReusedExchange(BroadcastExchange), but the returned UnsafeHashedRelation is missing numKeys.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the current type of TorrentBroadcast._value is SoftReference, so the UnsafeHashedRelation obtained by deserialization loses numKeys, which will lead to incorrect calculation results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a line of assert to an existing unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to upgrade netty to 4.1.75 and this pr add the explicit dependency on `netty-tcnative-classes` because the dependency on `netty-tcnative-classes` is changed to `Optional` in [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12146).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe release notes as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://netty.io/news/2022/03/10/4-1-75-Final.html\r\n\r\nThere are 2 import changes in this version and both of these changes are to reduce memory-overhead:\r\n\r\n- [Reduce the default PooledByteBufAllocator chunk size from 16 MiB to 4 MiB](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12108)\r\n- [Change default of io.netty.allocator.useCacheForAllThreads to false](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/12109)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, all changes are caused by the change of Netty.\r\nIf the user wants to maintain the same behavior as the previous version, the user needs to make the following configuration:\r\n\r\n- add `-Dio.netty.allocator.useCacheForAllThreads=true` to enable `useCacheForAllThreads `\r\n- add `-Dio.netty.allocator.maxOrder=11` to keep the chunk size of `PooledByteBufAllocator` to 16m\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-13T10:29:39Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T14:57:15Z","closed_at":"2022-03-19T13:54:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e255462d19959cb76d3ed9acb6423c264034c9dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6577bf67742c8b347601d29cef4474ed241c9293","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:upgrade-netty-4175","ref":"upgrade-netty-4175","sha":"6577bf67742c8b347601d29cef4474ed241c9293","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnable K8S integration tests in Github Action.\r\nNote that this PR didn't add Volcano test due to limited resource of github action.\r\n\r\nFor current implementations, we enable 2 style k8s ci: \r\n- **on push**: validation on each commits pushed (PR tirgger) and merged (commits post validation): [test push demo](https://github.com/Yikun/spark/runs/5598194384?check_suite_focus=true)\r\n\r\n- **workflow_dispatch** for manually PR/Branch/tags validation:\r\n  - [validate pr demo](https://github.com/Yikun/spark/runs/5598207912?check_suite_focus=true)\r\n  - [validate branch-3.3 failed demo](https://github.com/Yikun/spark/runs/5598210635?check_suite_focus=true) (because 3.3 IT didn't support test.driver.cpu yet)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1277\" alt=\"image\"

development and guarantee the quality of spark on K8S in some level.\r\n\r\n- Why setting driver 0.5 cpu, executor 0.2 cpu?\r\n  Github-hosted runner hardware limited: 2U7G\r\n  IT Job available CPU = 2U - 0.85U(K8S deploy) = 1.15U \r\n  There are 1.15 cpu left after k8s installation, to meet the requirement of K8S tests (one driver + max to 3 executors).\r\n\r\n- Time cost info:\r\n  - 14 mins to compile related code.\r\n  - 3 mins to build docker images.\r\n  - 20-30 mins to test\r\n  - Total: about 30-40 mins\r\n\r\n- Stablity:\r\n  I also do a stablity validation based on scheduled job:\r\n  https://github.com/spark-volcano/spark/actions/workflows/k8s_integration_test.yml\r\n  All test passed always passed at each half hours since enable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nK8s has [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) and Apache Spark is currently using both `Statefulset*` and `StatefulSet*`. The worst case is a mixed case like `class StatefulSetAllocatorSuite` in `StatefulsetAllocatorSuite.scala`.

`StatefulSet`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c032928515e74367137c668ce692d8fd53696485/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/k8s/StatefulsetAllocatorSuite.scala#L39\r\n\r\nTo

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSince the dynamic gapduration has been added in the session window,[#33691](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33691) users are allowed to enter invalid gapduration ,then filter invalide events . However, for now, test cases are only added for zero and negative gapduration. I think it is necessary to add test cases for invalid gapduration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR uses a manual recursion to replace `RuntimeReplaceable` expressions instead of `transformAllExpressionsWithPruning`. The problem of `transformAllExpressionsWithPruning` is it will automatically make the replacement expression inherit  the function alias name from the parent node, which is quite misleading. For example, `select date_part('month', c) from t`, the optimized plan in EXPLAIN before this PR is\r\n```\r\nProject [date_part(cast(c#18 as date)) AS date_part(month, c)#19]\r\n+- Relation default.t[c#18] parquet\r\n```\r\nNow it's\r\n```\r\nProject [month(cast(c#9 as date)) AS date_part(month, c)#10]\r\n+- Relation default.t[c#9] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix misleading EXPLAIN result\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Bump Volcano to v1.5.1: https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/issues/2090\r\n- Use capability to limit disable queue\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn Volcano, weight should be [a positive integer](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/blob/c5bed286211af4f9d94503968c1c6b06baa882d1/pkg/webhooks/admission/queues/validate/validate_queue.go#L188), so weight 0 is a wrong usage. As [description](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/queue/) for queue\r\n- weight is a soft constraint.\r\n- capability is a hard constraint.\r\n\r\nWe better to use capability to limit disable queue. This also fix the error `requestBody.spec.weight: Invalid value: 0: queue weight must be a positive integer` when running latest volcano image.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\n# arm64\r\nkubectl apply -f

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the case when an user specifies the corrupt record column via the CSV option `columnNameOfCorruptRecord`:\r\n1. Disable the column pruning feature in the CSV parser.\r\n2. Don't push filters to `UnivocityParser` that refer to the \"virtual\" column `columnNameOfCorruptRecord`. Since the column cannot present in the input CSV, user's queries fail while compiling predicates. After the changes, the skipped filters are applied later on the upper layer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes allow to refer to the corrupt record column from user's queries:\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nspark.read.format(\"csv\")\r\n  .option(\"header\", \"true\")\r\n  .option(\"columnNameOfCorruptRecord\", \"corrRec\")\r\n  .schema(schema)\r\n  .load(\"csv_corrupt_record.csv\")\r\n  .filter($\"corrRec\".isNotNull)\r\n  .show()\r\n```\r\nfor the input file \"csv_corrupt_record.csv\":\r\n```\r\n0,2013-111_11 12:13:14\r\n1,1983-08-04 \r\n```\r\nthe query returns:\r\n```\r\n+---+----+----------------------+\r\n|a  |b   |corrRec               |\r\n+---+----+----------------------+\r\n|0  |null|0,2013-111_11 12:13:14|\r\n+---+----+----------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the changes, the query above fails with the exception:\r\n```Java\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: _corrupt_record does not exist. Available: a, b\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType.$anonfun$fieldIndex$1(StructType.scala:310) ~[classes/:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new CSV test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *.CSVv1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *.CSVv2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to enrich the method contract of iterator in StateStore, that the returned iterator is not guaranteed to reflect all updates being performed \"after\" it has been initialized.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe lack of information on the method contract could mislead callers to expect some guarantees although not described. It would be nice to add to the contract to make clear. It could also help to implementations that they are not required to guarantee such thing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A","created_at":"2022-03-11T08:06:12Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T01:09:22Z","closed_at":"2022-03-23T01:09:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c033b76b862e123fd8e431decbadc7e1643db4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs described in [SPARK-38320](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38320), the bug is that it is possible for (flat)MapGroupsWithState to timeout a key even if that key received data within the same batch. This is against the documented (flat)MapGroupsWithState contract. The problem is due to the StateStore.iterator not reflecting StateStore changes made *after* its creation - this is illustrated in the test this PR adds to StateStoreSuite.scala.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to *late bind* the timeoutProcessorIter timeout processing iterator in FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec to be created *after* the input iterator has been exhausted and the state changes applied to the StateStore.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe changes are needed to ensure the state timeout processing iterator for (flat)MapGroupsWithState is created *after* the input is processed and the changes are applied into the StateStore, otherwise it may not notice these changes (the change to the key timeout timestamp being updated as part of the input processing).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. Bug fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n* Added a test to StateStoreSuite.scala to illustrate the difference of state store iterator behavior across the different implementations of state stores. In particular the test illustrates the RocksDB state store iterator not reflecting state store changes made after its creation.\r\n* Added test to FlatMapGroupsWithStateSuite.scala which would fail with unexpected state timeout if the issue was not fixed.","created_at":"2022-03-10T22:34:43Z","updated_at":"2022-03-13T05:12:57Z","closed_at":"2022-03-13T04:55:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1ac4308e86b84ced7be6c8edd981ce19645164e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

We can delete it because there is no plan for `volcano` scheduler to use executor pod group template at Apache Spark 3.3.x.\r\n\r\nFor the other custom schedulers, they still can use `spark.kubernetes.scheduler.XXX.executor.podGroupTemplateFile`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support multiple customer schedulers in an isolated manner, we need to isolate

Instead, it currently takes Spark at least N  iterations to resolve such expressions, where N is proportional to the depth of the Expression tree.\r\n\r\nExample to reproduce: \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef resolveExpr(spark: SparkSession, exprStr: String, tableSchema: StructType): Expression = {\r\n  val expr = spark.sessionState.sqlParser.parseExpression(exprStr)\r\n  val analyzer = spark.sessionState.analyzer\r\n  val schemaFields = tableSchema.fields\r\n\r\n  val resolvedExpr = {\r\n    val plan: LogicalPlan = Filter(expr, LocalRelation(schemaFields.head, schemaFields.drop(1): _*))\r\n    val rules: Seq[Rule[LogicalPlan]] = {\r\n      analyzer.ResolveFunctions ::\r\n      analyzer.ResolveReferences ::\r\n      Nil\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    rules.foldRight(plan)((rule, plan) => rule.apply(plan))\r\n      .asInstanceOf[Filter]\r\n      .condition\r\n  }\r\n  resolvedExpr\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Invoke with\r\nresolveExpr(spark, \"date_format(to_timestamp(B, 'yyyy-MM-dd'),

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove implicit `priorityClassName` propagation from driver pod to podgroup in favor of explicit settings via Driver Pod templates and PodGroup templates.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apache Spark supports different `priorityClassName` for driver and executors. In Apache Spark, the most complex case is that the users use three priorityClassNames for (1) driver pod, (2) executor pod, and (3) podgroup.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows users define and use different sets for pod priority and pod group in case of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35786#discussion_r823745191 .\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CI and K8s ITs.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] KubernetesSuite:\r\n[info] VolcanoSuite:\r\n[info] - Run SparkPi with volcano scheduler (9 seconds, 975 milliseconds)\r\n[info]

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe can skip do partial aggregation to avoid spilling if this step does not reduce the number of rows too much. \r\n\r\nBy setting `spark.sql.aggregate.adaptivePartialAggregationThreshold` to 0 this feature can be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove partial aggregation phase performance and we can implement these 2 features after this PR:\r\n1. SPARK-36245: Partial deduplicate the right side of left semi/anti join\r\n2. SPARK-38506: Push partial aggregation through join\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and TPC-H 5T benchmark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Unregister the functions `timestampadd()` and `timestampdiff()` in `FunctionRegistry.expressions`.\r\n2. Remove the aliases `date_add` for `timestampadd()` and `date_diff` for `timestampdiff()`.\r\n3. Align tests (regenerate golden files) to the syntax rules\r\n```\r\nprimaryExpression\r\n    | name=(TIMESTAMPADD | DATEADD) LEFT_PAREN unit=identifier COMMA unitsAmount=valueExpression COMMA timestamp=valueExpression RIGHT_PAREN             #timestampadd\r\n    | name=(TIMESTAMPDIFF | DATEDIFF) LEFT_PAREN unit=identifier COMMA startTimestamp=valueExpression COMMA endTimestamp=valueExpression RIGHT_PAREN    #timestampdiff\r\n```\r\nwhere the first parameter `unit` can have one of the identifiers:\r\n   - YEAR\r\n   - QUARTER\r\n   - MONTH\r\n   - WEEK\r\n   - DAY, DAYOFYEAR (valid for timestampadd)\r\n   - HOUR\r\n   - MINUTE\r\n   - SECOND\r\n   - MILLISECOND\r\n   - MICROSECOND\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The `timestampadd()`/`timestampdiff()` functions (and their aliases) with arbitrary string column as the first parameter is not require by any standard.\r\n2. Remove the functions and aliases should reduce maintenance cost.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the functions and aliases haven't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DateTimeUtilsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is the branch-3.2 PR for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35792. Note I also pulled in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/068d53bd5d89c96bf0cdb05d3ec7f2f023cf3875 from [SPARK-37735] to pick up adding appId to KubernetesConf. I don't see that as an issue since its private, this was actually the fix I originally had as I was testing on 3.2 and then realized someone added it on master branch.\r\n\r\nRunning spark-shell in client mode on Kubernetes cluster when mounting persistent volumes with a storage class results in a big warning being thrown on startup.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38379[](https://github.com/tgravescs)\r\n\r\nThe issue here is there is a race condition between when spark.app.id is set in SparkContext and when its used, so change to use the KubernetesConf appId, which is what is used to set spark.app.id.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThrows big warning to user and I believe the label is wrong as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test added. The test fails without the fix.\r\nAlso manually tested on real k8s cluster.","created_at":"2022-03-10T14:58:09Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T18:00:52Z","closed_at":"2022-03-10T18:00:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b253d9b176c8512f8c8cb1ab0af25289a857f649","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35804/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35804/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35804/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f768a3c73433841a7f16c787eedde7ccff75ddd9","head":{"label":"tgravescs:k8smount32","ref":"k8smount32","sha":"f768a3c73433841a7f16c787eedde7ccff75ddd9","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, if user want to add an customized StreamingListener to StreamingContext, we need to add this listener in customized code.\r\n```\r\nstreamingContext.addStreamingListener()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this pr, we can define customized StreamingListener by set conf\r\n```\r\nspark.streaming.extraListeners\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it can support two constructor\r\n\r\n1. No construct parameter \r\n2. one constructor parameter of `SparkConf`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSome time we want to add some common StreamingListener to do some customized analysis, it is noisy to do this for all job, with this configuration, we can do this together just by setting a common env.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can set StreamingContext by set configuration\r\n```\r\nspark.streaming.extraListeners\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix `expose make_date expression in R` test case to pass with ANSI mode enabled by excluding data that throws an exception when ANSI mode is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the tests independent from configurations, and to improve test coverage (ANSI mode will be tested with GitHub Actions).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should test it out.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-10T06:23:54Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:50:42Z","closed_at":"2022-03-10T16:03:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95ec8d7a3a550cbf5eb49b1d8a85c9cc5833ccdc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2f3d3d2f6485f7a121b78595cdd0e7bbc93f82b","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-38451","ref":"SPARK-38451","sha":"a2f3d3d2f6485f7a121b78595cdd0e7bbc93f82b","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes row-level runtime filters in Spark to reduce intermediate data volume for operators like shuffle, join and aggregate, and hence improve performance. We propose two mechanisms to do this: semi-join filters or bloom filters, and both mechanisms are proposed to co-exist side-by-side behind feature configs.\r\n[Design Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IEuyLeQlubQkH8YuVuXWKo2-grVIoDJqQpHZrE7q04/edit?usp=sharing) with more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWith Semi-Join, we see 9 queries improve for the TPC DS 3TB benchmark, and no regressions. \r\nWith Bloom Filter, we see 10 queries improve for the TPC DS 3TB benchmark, and no regressions. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to throw `SparkArithmeticException` from the datetime function: `timestampadd()` and from its aliases `date_add()`/`dateadd()` with the error class `DATETIME_OVERFLOW` in the case when internal arithmetic or datetime overflow occurs.  The new error classes are added to `error-classes.json`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPorting the functions to new error framework should improve user experience with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nBefore the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestampadd(YEAR, 1000000, timestamp'2022-03-09 01:02:03');\r\njava.lang.ArithmeticException: long overflow\r\n\tat java.lang.Math.multiplyExact(Math.java:892) ~[?:1.8.0_292]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestampadd(YEAR, 1000000, timestamp'2022-03-09 01:02:03');\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: The 'timestampadd' function overflows the input '2022-03-08T22:02:03Z' timestamp by 1000000 YEAR.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, but the datetime functions `timestampadd()` and its aliases `dateadd()`/`date_add()` haven't released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-03-09T11:59:10Z","updated_at":"2022-03-10T12:25:07Z","closed_at":"2022-03-10T12:25:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d479b2414909e8f75115c2ff878e980dfa3f59d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cbfcabb71cae300053e30afbcf74b0912d749211","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:timestamp_add_diff-overflow","ref":"timestamp_add_diff-overflow","sha":"cbfcabb71cae300053e30afbcf74b0912d749211","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/u

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `spark.kubernetes.job.queue` in favor of `spark.kubernetes.driver.podGroupTemplateFile` for Apache Spark 3.3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are several batch execution scheduler options including custom schedulers in K8s environment.\r\nWe had better isolate scheduler specific settings instead of introducing a new configuration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the previous configuration is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe logic of the `ColumnarBatchRow.get` is very similar to `ColumnarRow.get` and `MutableColumnarRow.get`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is changed to make the above 3 methods call `SpecializedGettersReader.read` to clean up duplicate codes.\r\n\r\nThe `SpecializedGettersReader.read` is also used by `UnsafeArrayData.get`, `UnsafeRow.get` and `ColumnarArray.get` in Spark code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up duplicate codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

This pr add a new logical plan visitor named `DistinctKeyVisitor` to find out all the distinct attributes in current logical plan. For example:\r\n   ```scala\r\n   spark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE t(a int, b int, c int) using parquet\")\r\n   spark.sql(\"SELECT a, b, a % 10, max(c), sum(b) FROM t GROUP BY a, b\").queryExecution.analyzed.distinctKeys\r\n   ```\r\n   The output is: {a#1, b#2}.\r\n\r\n2. Enhance `RemoveRedundantAggregates` to remove the aggregation if it is groupOnly and the child can guarantee distinct. For example:\r\n   ```sql\r\n   set spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1; -- avoid PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin\r\n   create table t1 using parquet as select id a, id as b from range(10);\r\n   create table t2 using parquet as select id as a, id as b from range(8);\r\n   select t11.a, t11.b from (select distinct a, b from t1) t11 left semi join t2 on (t11.a = t2.a) group by t11.a, t11.b;\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR handles case 2 and 3 mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38385.\r\nSpecifically,\r\n1. For empty query, output a specific error message ‘syntax error, unexpected SQL statement’\r\n    * Before\r\n        ```\r\n        ParseException: \r\n        mismatched input '<EOF>' expecting {'(', 'CONVERT', 'COPY', 'OPTIMIZE', 'RESTORE', 'ADD', 'ALTER', 'ANALYZE', 'CACHE', 'CLEAR', 'COMMENT', 'COMMIT', 'CREATE', 'DELETE', 'DESC', 'DESCRIBE', 'DFS', 'DROP', 'EXPLAIN', 'EXPORT', 'FROM', 'GRANT', 'IMPORT', 'INSERT', 'LIST', 'LOAD', 'LOCK', 'MAP', 'MERGE', 'MSCK', 'REDUCE', 'REFRESH', 'REPLACE', 'RESET', 'REVOKE', 'ROLLBACK', 'SELECT', 'SET', 'SHOW', 'START', 'TABLE', 'TRUNCATE', 'UNCACHE', 'UNLOCK', 'UPDATE', 'USE', 'VALUES', 'WITH'}(line 1, pos 0)\r\n        \r\n        == SQL ==\r\n        \r\n        ^^^ \r\n        ```\r\n    * After\r\n        ```\r\n        ParseException: \r\n        syntax error, unexpected SQL statement(line 1, pos 0)\r\n        \r\n        == SQL ==\r\n        \r\n        ^^^\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n2.

That way, the error messages for empty queries would be \"unexpected empty statement\".\r\n\r\n* SparkParserErrorStrategy.scala\r\n    Define a new dictionary from the input jargon words to user-facing words. In the current mismatch input error, substitute the token to user-facing language. That way, there would be no '\\<EOF\\>'.\r\n\r\n* test suites\r\n    Add two more testcases testing the above cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38384 The description states the reason for the change.\r\nTLDR, the error messages of ParseException directly coming from ANTLR are not user-friendly and we want to improve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIf the error messages change are considered as user-facing change, then yes.\r\nThe changes in the error message:\r\n1.  For empty query, output a specific error message ‘syntax error, unexpected SQL statement’\r\n2. For the faulty token '\\<EOF\\>'., substitute it to a readable string ‘end of input’.\r\n\r\nExample cases are listed in the top of this PR description.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support driver/executor `PodGroup` templates like the following.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: scheduling.volcano.sh/v1beta1\r\nkind: PodGroup\r\nspec:\r\n  minMember: 1000\r\n  minResources:\r\n    cpu: \"4\"\r\n    memory: \"16Gi\"\r\n  priorityClassName: executor-priority\r\n  queue: executor-queue\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a simpler, more extensible and robust way to support Volcano future because we don't need to add new configurations like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35640 for all Volcano features.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo because this is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn current V2 code, we can see that when table exist and `ignoreIfExists` = true,  spark won't do nothing\r\n```\r\ncase class CreateTableExec(\r\n    catalog: TableCatalog,\r\n    identifier: Identifier,\r\n    tableSchema: StructType,\r\n    partitioning: Seq[Transform],\r\n    tableSpec: TableSpec,\r\n    ignoreIfExists: Boolean) extends LeafV2CommandExec {\r\n  import org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.CatalogV2Implicits._\r\n\r\n  val tableProperties = CatalogV2Util.convertTableProperties(tableSpec)\r\n\r\n  override protected def run(): Seq[InternalRow] = {\r\n    if (!catalog.tableExists(identifier)) {\r\n      try {\r\n        catalog.createTable(identifier, tableSchema, partitioning.toArray, tableProperties.asJava)\r\n      } catch {\r\n        case _: TableAlreadyExistsException if ignoreIfExists =>\r\n          logWarning(s\"Table ${identifier.quoted} was created concurrently.

Under this case we just can do nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRemove unnecessary call create table, especially hive metastore\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of #35639 to prevent `PodGroup` with `null` spec. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFirst, for `null` value, we should use `Option(null)` to make it `None`. This PR fixes the following.\r\n```\r\n- priorityClassName = Some(pod.pod.getSpec.getPriorityClassName)\r\n+ priorityClassName = Option(pod.pod.getSpec.getPriorityClassName)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, when `queue` and `priorityClassName` are not given. `PodGroup` is created with `null` spec.\r\nThis causes NullPointerException during the test case. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark DS V2 could push down filters into JDBC source. However, only the most basic form of filter is supported.\r\nOn the other hand, some JDBC source could not compile the filters by themselves way.\r\n\r\nThis PR reactor the framework so as JDBC dialect could compile expression by self way.\r\nFirst, The framework translate catalyst expressions to DS V2 filters.\r\nSecond, The JDBC dialect could compile DS V2 filters to different SQL syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake  the framework be more common use.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nThe feature is not released.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-08T13:19:33Z","updated_at":"2023-06-09T11:16:00Z","closed_at":"2022-03-22T07:46:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"303a25bf16776994a87b49e575729311116138ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35768/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35768/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35768/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fc6039f6c8a428715694afe303765992dc3b746e","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-38432_new","ref":"SPARK-38432_new","sha":"fc6039f6c8a428715694afe303765992dc3b746e","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhile `log4j.ignoreTCL/log4j2.ignoreTCL` is false, which is the default, it uses the context ClassLoader for the current Thread, see `org.apache.logging.log4j.util.LoaderUtil.loadClass`. While ExecutorClassLoader try to loadClass through remotely though the FileDownload, if error occurs, we will long on debug level, and `log4j...LoaderUtil` will be blocked by ExecutorClassLoader acquired classloading lock.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it only happens when ThresholdFilter's level is `debug`.\r\n\r\nor we can set `log4j.ignoreTCL/log4j2.ignoreTCL` to true, but I don't know what else it will cause.\r\n\r\nSo in this PR, I simply remove the debug log which cause this deadlock\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nwhen access rdbms, such as mysql, this patch can automatically calculate upper and lower bounds according to the primary key to improve parallelism and speed up query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nwhen access rdbms, such as mysql, if partitionColumn, lowerBound, upperBound, numPartitions are not specified, by default only one partition to scan database is working. \r\n\r\nIt makes load data from database slow and makes it difficult for users to configure multiple parameters to improve parallelism.\r\n\r\nThis patch can automatically calculate upper and lower bounds according to the primary key to improve parallelism and speed up query.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes. new config `defaultNumPartitions` in JDBCOptions.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes a correctness bug in `Union` in the case that there are duplicate output columns. Previously, duplicate columns on one side of the union would result in a duplicate column being output on the other side of the union.\r\n\r\nTo do so, we go through the union’s child’s output and find the duplicates. For each duplicate set, there is a first duplicate: this one is left alone. All following duplicates are aliased and given a tag; this tag is used to remove ambiguity during resolution.\r\n\r\nAs the first duplicate is left alone, the user can still select it, avoiding a breaking change. As the later duplicates are given new expression IDs, this fixes the correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOutput of union with duplicate columns in the children was incorrect\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nExample query:\r\n```\r\nSELECT a, a FROM VALUES (1, 1), (1, 2) AS t1(a, b)\r\nUNION ALL SELECT c, d FROM VALUES (2, 2), (2, 3) AS t2(c, d)\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult before:\r\n```\r\na | a\r\n_ | _\r\n1 | 1\r\n1 | 1\r\n2 | 2\r\n2 | 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult after:\r\n```\r\na | a\r\n_ | _\r\n1 | 1\r\n1 | 1\r\n2 | 2\r\n2 | 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis followup for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35488 proposes to fix ANSI conf check properly in `python/pyspark/pandas/utils.py`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSo far, the condition `if spark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\"):` always went True, since `spark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\")` returns `\"true\"` or `\"false\"` instead of `True` or `False`.\r\n\r\nSo, it's always show the warning message although the ANSI mode is not enabled.\r\n\r\nWe might need to check the returned string properly so that we can only show the warning message when the `\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\"` is actually set as True.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNow users see warning message when only `\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\"` is set as True.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test, and the existing tests are should be passed.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-07T22:24:03Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:42:51Z","closed_at":"2022-03-08T00:59:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"901a5c9fd8356df157872a1faded657c879c150d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/667d6f4aa06fc40f3a8c8e13e3c2220526ff8f51","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-38183-followup","ref":"SPARK-38183-followup","sha":"667d6f4aa06fc40f3a8c8e13e3c2220526ff8f51","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support the lenient mode by the row serializer used by datasources to converts rows received from scans. Spark SQL will be able to accept:\r\n- `java.time.Instant` and `java.sql.Timestamp` for the `TIMESTAMP` type, and\r\n- `java.time.LocalDate` and `java.sql.Date` for the `DATE` type\r\n\r\nindependently from the current value of the SQL config `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA datasource might not aware of the Spark SQL config `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` if this datasource was developed before the config was introduced by Spark version 3.0.0. In that case, it always return \"legacy\" timestamps/dates of the types `java.sql.Timestamp`/`java.sql.Date` even if an user enabled Java 8 API. As Spark expects `java.time.Instant` or `java.time.LocalDate` but gets `java.time.Timestamp` or `java.sql.Date`, the user observes the exception:\r\n```java\r\nERROR SparkExecuteStatementOperation: Error executing query with ac61b10a-486e-463b-8726-3b61da58582e, currentState RUNNING,  \r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 2.0 failed 4 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.3 in stage 2.0 (TID 8) (10.157.1.194 executor 0): java.lang.RuntimeException: Error while encoding: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.sql.Timestamp is not a valid external type for schema of timestamp  \r\nif (assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.Row, true]).isNullAt) null else staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.DateTimeUtils$, TimestampType, instantToMicros, validateexternaltype(getexternalrowfield(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.Row, true]), 0, loan_perf_date), TimestampType), true, false) AS loan_perf_date#1125  \r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoder$Serializer.apply(ExpressionEncoder.scala:239)  \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue above. And after the changes, users can use legacy datasource connecters with new Spark versions even when they need to enable Java 8 API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *CodeGenerationSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ObjectExpressionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *RowEncoderSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen ANSI mode is off, `ArrayType(DoubleType, containsNull = false)` can't cast as `ArrayType(IntegerType, containsNull = false)` since there can be overflow thus result in null results and breaks the non-null constraint.\r\n\r\nWhen ANSI mode is on, currently Spark SQL has the same behavior. However, this is not correct since the non-null constraint won't be break. Spark SQL can just execute the cast and throw runtime error on overflow, just like casting DoubleType as IntegerType.\r\n\r\nThis applies to MapType and StructType as well.  This PR is to loosen the limitation of casting non-null Array/Map/Struct types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor ANSI mode compliance\r\n<img width=\"559\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/156600154-24e3817b-ba22-45ce-a16f-faf7461af73e.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, for Cast under ANSI mode or table insertion, a complex type which don't contain null can be cast as another non-null complex type as long as the element types are castable. Before changes, this is only allowed when the source element type can be upcast to the target element type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-03-07T12:17:08Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T04:04:39Z","closed_at":"2022-03-09T04:04:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cceb3b2781a62b1f170230ee2fbefdfec4435251","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35754/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35754/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35754/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e5b1615247329a09d5caac7b7cb85c333bd350c3","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:port-35724","ref":"port-35724","sha":"e5b1615247329a09d5caac7b7cb85c333bd350c3","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere is no shell code check in the current spark github actions. Some shell codes are written incorrectly and run abnormally in special cases. Besides, they cannot also pass the check of the shellcheck plugin, especially in IDEA or shellcheck actions. This PR try to add [shellstyle](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/shellcheck) action, which use [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) to check code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis action can ensure the normal execution of the spark shell script\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nOrigin UT with new

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug in generator nested column pruning. The bug happens when the extractor pattern is like `GetArrayStructFields(GetStructField(...), ...)` on the generator output. Once the input to the generator is an array, after replacing with the extractor based on pruning logic, it becomes an extractor of `GetArrayStructFields(GetArrayStructFields(...), ...)` which is not valid.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.
