We will not remove the constants, but we recommend using <code>StandardCharsets</code> for consistency. (45e6be2688)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added <code>ToStringHelper.omitEmptyValues()</code>. (f5ec2ab85c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added an optimized <code>copyOf</code> method to <code>TreeRangeMap</code>. (a46565dd1c)</li>\n<li><code>collect.testing</code>: Fixed <code>@Require</code> annotations so that features implied by absent features are not also required to be absent. (81be061f85)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Changed <code>ByteSink</code> and <code>CharSink</code> to no longer call <code>flush()</code> in some cases before <code>close()</code>. This is a no-op for well-behaved streams, which internally flush their data as part of closing. However, we have discovered some stream implementations that have overridden <code>close()</code> to do nothing, including not to flush some buffered data. If this change causes problems, the simplest fix is usually to change the <code>close()</code> override to at least call <code>flush()</code>. (6ace8bc8ea)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders.ALT_SVC</code> and <code>MediaType.CBOR</code>.

We will not remove the constants, but we recommend using <code>StandardCharsets</code> for consistency. (45e6be2688)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added <code>ToStringHelper.omitEmptyValues()</code>. (f5ec2ab85c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added an optimized <code>copyOf</code> method to <code>TreeRangeMap</code>. (a46565dd1c)</li>\n<li><code>collect.testing</code>: Fixed <code>@Require</code> annotations so that features implied by absent features are not also required to be absent. (81be061f85)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Changed <code>ByteSink</code> and <code>CharSink</code> to no longer call <code>flush()</code> in some cases before <code>close()</code>. This is a no-op for well-behaved streams, which internally flush their data as part of closing. However, we have discovered some stream implementations that have overridden <code>close()</code> to do nothing, including not to flush some buffered data. If this change causes problems, the simplest fix is usually to change the <code>close()</code> override to at least call <code>flush()</code>. (6ace8bc8ea)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders.ALT_SVC</code> and <code>MediaType.CBOR</code>.

href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases\">org.jsoup:jsoup's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>jsoup-1.18.3</h2>\n<p><code>1.18.3</code> is a quick release to fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2235\">#2235</a> in <code>1.18.2</code>.</p>\n<p>Please see also the full release notes for <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.18.2\">jsoup 1.18.2</a> if you are coming from an earlier release.</p>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When serializing to XML, attribute names containing <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>, or digits were incorrectly considered invalid and removed. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2235\">#2235</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>jsoup 1.18.2</h2>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimized the throughput and memory use throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC  down between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs. Most inputs sizes will see  throughput increases of ~ 20%. These performance improvements come through recycling the backing <code>byte[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>  arrays used to read and parse the input. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2186\">2186</a></li>\n<li>Speed optimized <code>html()</code> and <code>Entities.escape()</code> when the input contains UTF characters in a supplementary plane, by around 49%. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2183\">2183</a></li>\n<li>The form associated elements returned by <code>FormElement.elements()</code> now reflect changes made to the DOM, subsequently to the original parse. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2140\">2140</a></li>\n<li>In the <code>TreeBuilder</code>, the <code>onNodeInserted()</code> and <code>onNodeClosed()</code> events are now also fired for the outermost / root <code>Document</code> node. This enables source position tracking on the Document node (which was previously unset). And it also enables the node traversor to see the outer Document node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2182\">2182</a></li>\n<li>Selected Elements can now be position swapped inline using <code>Elements#set()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2212\">2212</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail if the element's class contained a <code>*</code>  character. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2169\">2169</a></li>\n<li>When tracking source ranges, a text node following an invalid self-closing element may be left untracked. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2175\">2175</a></li>\n<li>When a document has no doctype, or a doctype not named <code>html</code>, it should be parsed in Quirks Mode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2197\">2197</a></li>\n<li>With a selector like <code>div:has(span + a)</code>, the <code>has()</code> component was not working correctly, as the inner combining query caused the evaluator to match those against the outer's siblings, not  children. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2187\">2187</a></li>\n<li>A selector query that included multiple <code>:has()</code> components in a nested <code>:has()</code> might incorrectly execute. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2131\">2131</a></li>\n<li>When cookie names in a response are duplicated, the simple view of cookies available via <code>Connection.Response#cookies()</code> will provide the last one set. Generally it is better to use the <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/cookbook/web/request-session\">Jsoup.newSession</a> method to maintain a cookie jar, as that applies appropriate path selection on cookies when making requests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1831\">1831</a></li>\n<li>When parsing named HTML entities, base entities should resolve if they are a prefix of the input token (and not in an attribute). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2207\">2207</a></li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect tracking of source ranges for attributes merged from late-occurring elements that were implicitly created (<code>html</code> or <code>body</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204\">2204</a></li>\n<li>Follow the current HTML specification in the tokenizer to allow <code>&lt;</code> as part of a tag name, instead of emitting it as a character node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2230\">2230</a></li>\n<li>Similarly, allow a <code>&lt;</code> as the start of an attribute name, vs creating a new element. The previous behavior was intended to parse closer to what we anticipated the author's intent to be, but that does not align to the spec or to how browsers behave. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1483\">1483</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES.md\">org.jsoup:jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.18.3 (PENDING)</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When serializing to XML, attribute names containing <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>, or digits were incorrectly marked as invalid and\nremoved. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2235\">2235</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.18.2 (2024-Nov-27)</h2>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimized the throughput and memory use throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC\ndown between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs.

These performance improvements come through recycling the backing <code>byte[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>\narrays used to read and parse the input. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2186\">2186</a></li>\n<li>Speed optimized <code>html()</code> and <code>Entities.escape()</code> when the input contains UTF characters in a supplementary plane, by\naround 49%. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2183\">2183</a></li>\n<li>The form associated elements returned by <code>FormElement.elements()</code> now reflect changes made to the DOM,\nsubsequently to the original parse. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2140\">2140</a></li>\n<li>In the <code>TreeBuilder</code>, the <code>onNodeInserted()</code> and <code>onNodeClosed()</code> events are now also fired for the outermost /\nroot <code>Document</code> node. This enables source position tracking on the Document node (which was previously unset). And\nit also enables the node traversor to see the outer Document node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2182\">2182</a></li>\n<li>Selected Elements can now be position swapped inline using\n<code>Elements#set()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2212\">2212</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail if the element's class contained a <code>*</code>\ncharacter. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2169\">2169</a></li>\n<li>When tracking source ranges, a text node following an invalid self-closing element may be left\nuntracked. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2175\">2175</a></li>\n<li>When a document has no doctype, or a doctype not named <code>html</code>, it should be parsed in Quirks\nMode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2197\">2197</a></li>\n<li>With a selector like <code>div:has(span + a)</code>, the <code>has()</code> component was not working correctly, as the inner combining\nquery caused the evaluator to match those against the outer's siblings, not\nchildren. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2187\">2187</a></li>\n<li>A selector query that included multiple <code>:has()</code> components in a nested <code>:has()</code> might incorrectly\nexecute. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2131\">2131</a></li>\n<li>When cookie names in a response are duplicated, the simple view of cookies available via\n<code>Connection.Response#cookies()</code> will provide the last one set. Generally it is better to use\nthe <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/cookbook/web/request-session\">Jsoup.newSession</a> method to maintain a cookie jar, as that\napplies appropriate path selection on cookies when making requests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1831\">1831</a></li>\n<li>When parsing named HTML entities, base entities should resolve if they are a prefix of the input token (and not in an\nattribute). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2207\">2207</a></li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect tracking of source ranges for attributes merged from late-occurring elements that were implicitly\ncreated (<code>html</code> or <code>body</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204\">2204</a></li>\n<li>Follow the current HTML specification in the tokenizer to allow <code>&lt;</code> as part of a tag name, instead of emitting it as a\ncharacter node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2230\">2230</a></li>\n<li>Similarly, allow a <code>&lt;</code> as the start of an attribute name, vs creating a new element. The previous behavior was\nintended to parse closer to what we anticipated the author's intent to be, but that does not align to the spec or to</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases\">org.jsoup:jsoup's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>jsoup-1.18.3</h2>\n<p><code>1.18.3</code> is a quick release to fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2235\">#2235</a> in <code>1.18.2</code>.</p>\n<p>Please see also the full release notes for <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.18.2\">jsoup 1.18.2</a> if you are coming from an earlier release.</p>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When serializing to XML, attribute names containing <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>, or digits were incorrectly considered invalid and removed. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2235\">#2235</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>jsoup 1.18.2</h2>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimized the throughput and memory use throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC  down between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs. Most inputs sizes will see  throughput increases of ~ 20%. These performance improvements come through recycling the backing <code>byte[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>  arrays used to read and parse the input. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2186\">2186</a></li>\n<li>Speed optimized <code>html()</code> and <code>Entities.escape()</code> when the input contains UTF characters in a supplementary plane, by around 49%. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2183\">2183</a></li>\n<li>The form associated elements returned by <code>FormElement.elements()</code> now reflect changes made to the DOM, subsequently to the original parse. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2140\">2140</a></li>\n<li>In the <code>TreeBuilder</code>, the <code>onNodeInserted()</code> and <code>onNodeClosed()</code> events are now also fired for the outermost / root <code>Document</code> node. This enables source position tracking on the Document node (which was previously unset). And it also enables the node traversor to see the outer Document node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2182\">2182</a></li>\n<li>Selected Elements can now be position swapped inline using <code>Elements#set()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2212\">2212</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail if the element's class contained a <code>*</code>  character. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2169\">2169</a></li>\n<li>When tracking source ranges, a text node following an invalid self-closing element may be left untracked. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2175\">2175</a></li>\n<li>When a document has no doctype, or a doctype not named <code>html</code>, it should be parsed in Quirks Mode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2197\">2197</a></li>\n<li>With a selector like <code>div:has(span + a)</code>, the <code>has()</code> component was not working correctly, as the inner combining query caused the evaluator to match those against the outer's siblings, not  children. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2187\">2187</a></li>\n<li>A selector query that included multiple <code>:has()</code> components in a nested <code>:has()</code> might incorrectly execute. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2131\">2131</a></li>\n<li>When cookie names in a response are duplicated, the simple view of cookies available via <code>Connection.Response#cookies()</code> will provide the last one set. Generally it is better to use the <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/cookbook/web/request-session\">Jsoup.newSession</a> method to maintain a cookie jar, as that applies appropriate path selection on cookies when making requests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1831\">1831</a></li>\n<li>When parsing named HTML entities, base entities should resolve if they are a prefix of the input token (and not in an attribute). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2207\">2207</a></li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect tracking of source ranges for attributes merged from late-occurring elements that were implicitly created (<code>html</code> or <code>body</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204\">2204</a></li>\n<li>Follow the current HTML specification in the tokenizer to allow <code>&lt;</code> as part of a tag name, instead of emitting it as a character node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2230\">2230</a></li>\n<li>Similarly, allow a <code>&lt;</code> as the start of an attribute name, vs creating a new element.

requires minimum Java version of Java 8</li>\n<li>Quartz build system moved to Gradle</li>\n<li>3rd party libraries (slf4j, log4j, Hikari, etc.) upgraded to more recent versions</li>\n<li>Maven POMs generated from gradle declare 3rd party dependencies as &quot;provided&quot; scope</li>\n<li>Removal of old TerracottaJobStore</li>\n<li>&quot;NativeJob&quot; class removed from &quot;quartz-jobs&quot; artifact.

<strong>2.2.3</strong> to <strong>3.0.2</strong>, introducing some class renamings (details: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/vladmihalcea/flexy-pool/issues/73\">vladmihalcea/flexy-pool#73</a>).</p>\n<h3>Key Impacts:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Application Properties:</strong>\nIf your application uses <code>application.properties</code> (<code>.yaml</code>) to configure FlexyPool (<code>decorator.datasource.flexy-pool.*</code>), note that some properties have been renamed.\nHowever, the old property names remain functional and will continue to work at least until the next minor release (<strong>1.11.0</strong>).</li>\n<li><strong>Direct Class Usage:</strong>\nIf your application references FlexyPool property classes or uses custom factories directly, code migration is required to align with the new class names.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's

<strong>2.2.3</strong> to <strong>3.0.2</strong>, introducing some class renamings (details: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/vladmihalcea/flexy-pool/issues/73\">vladmihalcea/flexy-pool#73</a>).</p>\n<h3>Key Impacts:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Application Properties:</strong>\nIf your application uses <code>application.properties</code> (<code>.yaml</code>) to configure FlexyPool (<code>decorator.datasource.flexy-pool.*</code>), note that some properties have been renamed.\nHowever, the old property names remain functional and will continue to work at least until the next minor release (<strong>1.11.0</strong>).</li>\n<li><strong>Direct Class Usage:</strong>\nIf your application references FlexyPool property classes or uses custom factories directly, code migration is required to align with the new class names.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's
