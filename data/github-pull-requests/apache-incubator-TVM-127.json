It kind of hacks the batch_norm and relies on the bias being an attribute of conv2d. However, we cannot do this on relay. The new pass will make the layout of broadcast operators to fit conv2d correctly.\r\n* Memorize transformations so we won't create duplicated transformations.\r\n\r\nThis pr also did some cleaning to

this line in the TVM build docs:\r\n\r\n> LLVM is required for CPU codegen that needs LLVM\r\n\r\nIt isn't obvious that the cuda target would necessarily require the llvm dependency, and while the current doc doesn't explicitly state otherwise, having a note to clarify this up front for \"hello world\" tutorials could help avoid some confusion.\r\n\r\nAs discussed here:\r\n\r\nhttps://discuss.tvm.ai/t/does-tvm-use-llvm-while-compiling-for-cuda/458\r\n\r\n> Yes, even for CUDA target, the host side code needs to be generated. For that, LLVM is used. In this case, LLVM will not be involved in device code generation.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

\r\nEliminates unnecessary zero multiplications introduced by dilated kernel.\r\nAs discussed in issue 1887, there is still one more perf issue left: cache_read only supports continuous range, so in dilated conv cases, it will lead to extra memory loading which is not necessary for computation. But after profiling, I found this is not quite a bottleneck compared with zero multiplication issue, and workaround this limitation will make code more complicate, so it's not included in this PR.\r\n\r\n@merrymercy please help review,

is a fix for the problem mentioned [here on the forum](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/strange-expansion-of-tensors-bounds/1077).\r\n\r\nDuring compilation TVM sometimes reshapes tensors using the information from its uses. This is a very important feature because sometimes a schedule may introduce a new tensor (e.g. via `cache_write`), but use only a handful of elements out of it, in which case this transformation may reduce the tensor's size and remove unnecessary computations of unused elements. However, the same transformation sometimes expands tensor sizes. This happens because computing precise ranges for expressions is impossible in general, and often leads to overapproximation. In the example from the forum the expression is `i + (0 - i)`, for which the range is evaluated to be [-9; 9] because the range evaluation algorithm assumes that subexpressions `i` and `-i` are independent. Of course, this particular example may be simplified but it is always possible to construct an example that the simplifier won't be able to simplify.\r\n\r\nThe solution I propose is to compare the range computed from the uses and the original range from the tensor declaration, and use the smaller one. There are several concerns though:\r\n- I am not sure if the are any passes or schedules that rely on tensor expansion. If there are, this may lead to out-of-bounds errors.\r\n- Sometimes we cannot compare the ranges. It happens when there are variables involved. In this case I decided to fallback to the old behavior because otherwise the test `test_bound_nest_thread` from `test_schedule_bound_inference.py` fails (it uses a global variable `m` as a tensor size).\r\n- The test `test_bound_nest_thread` may also be caused to fail by fixing `m` to be any integer less than 32. The failure is due to additional checks at `message_passing.cc:36` and `schedule_ops.cc:184`, and I'm not sure if they are really necessary.\r\n- The test `test_schedule_bound_condition` fails because with this fix it cannot reproduce the original problem anymore (#1014). I removed it for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Also I considered another solution, namely intersect the two ranges. In theory this should be perfect, but in practice it results in too complex expressions, which eventually lead to messages like this:\r\n`loop_partition.cc:356: Cannot prove: ((((((1 + min((c.outer.h.fused/112), 7)) - max((c.outer.h.fused/112), 0)) - 1) - (8 - max((c.outer.h.fused/112), 0))) + 1) >= 0), when generating the post doubt loop`\r\nand also to errors like this:\r\n`TVMError: [17:49:02] split_host_device.cc:116: Check failed: !use_count_.count(v) variable c.outer.h.fused has been used before definition!`.\r\nThe reason is that some local variables leak into tensor bounds which are then used to generate certain conditions.)\r\n\r\n@tqchen Could you please provide some comments regarding this issue?","created_at":"2018-11-14T12:49:32Z","updated_at":"2019-11-03T17:51:18Z","closed_at":"2019-07-23T03:02:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fcf3460fa162dbf75f81e4f3a5c7475c7395ef30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

throws an assert error if the function contains multiple batch norm. (See the updated test case, previously it calls `simplify_inference` each time a new batch norm is added) The new expression after mutation doesn't have checked type, so when you unpack the next batch norm, you cannot get the type of the input data.\r\n\r\nThis patch fix this issue by mapping data of batch norm to its type before mutation when visiting a `call(batch_norm)`.

is a new version of OpFusion algorithm that is cleaner and general than the one used in NNVMv1.\r\n\r\n## Method\r\n\r\nThe main challenge of genenral fusor is to handle possible diamond shape branches, in the following graph, conv2d can be fused to elemwise add.\r\n```\r\n             conv2d\r\n            /  |  \\\r\n           /   |   \\\r\n         op    op   op\r\n          \\    |    /\r\n           \\   |   /\r\n          elemwise add\r\n               |\r\n``` \r\n  However, at the point of conv2d we do not necessarily know that all its future path will merge at the elemwise add. The new fusor algorithm applies [post-dominator analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominator_(graph_theory)). The immediate post-dominator of a node defined by the closest node where all the future path goes into. In the above case, the elemwise add is the immediate post-dominator of conv2d. The general algorithm is as follows:\r\n\r\n   - Construct a DAG of dataflow graph for dominator analysis\r\n  - Construct a post-dominator tree which gives immediate post-dominator of each node.\r\n  - Run fusion algorithm with the given post-dominator information.\r\n\r\n Note that, because we run analysis on a DAG, we use a single pass post-dominator\r\n  tree construction algorithm via LCA, which is simpler than the full version that handles cycles. \r\n\r\nThe fusion algorithm traverses from each node and checks if it can be fused to its immediate post dominator. It has to check the following things:\r\n   - CheckPath: check all the path between a node and its immediate post-dominator\r\n               satiesfies the fuse condition.\r\n  - Note that these intermediate node can already be fused with another nodes, the algorithm\r\n      will still run correctly.\r\n  - CommitFuse: mark all the nodes between source and post-dominator as the same group.\r\n  - We use an Union-Find data structure to manage the groups.","created_at":"2018-11-13T06:37:17Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T17:49:30Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T21:31:46Z","merged_at":"2018-11-13T21:31:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"4369b7f6a881e477799fec4461aba553751cb574","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2090/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2090/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2090/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ea4ffb1fae6f73a141a6f7cd3d13cdea8b249928","head":{"label":"tqchen:relay","ref":"relay","sha":"ea4ffb1fae6f73a141a6f7cd3d13cdea8b249928","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm

approach.","created_at":"2018-11-10T03:53:54Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T21:50:25Z","closed_at":"2018-11-10T05:08:04Z","merged_at":"2018-11-10T05:08:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ee13fc5f23873a81a135e81c3e330039ba56b75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2085/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/2085/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/2085/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1cd9951ec5e5782ccab72bdf058d2f30584affbb","head":{"label":"ajtulloch:nnpack-build-in-CI","ref":"nnpack-build-in-CI","sha":"1cd9951ec5e5782ccab72bdf058d2f30584affbb","user":{"login":"ajtulloch","id":1121581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjE1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1121581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch","html_url":"https://github.com/ajtulloch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137101191,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcxMDExOTE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"ajtulloch/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajtulloch","id":1121581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjE1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1121581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch","html_url":"https://github.com/ajtulloch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajtulloch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajtulloch/tvm","description":"Open

our best efforts, we still see substantially slower performance\r\nin for certain 3x3 layers on ARMv7 with TVM implementations (direct,\r\nWinograd F(2x2, 3x3), F(4x4, 3x3), F(6x6, 3x3)) compared to a\r\nwell-configured NNPACK's F(6x6, 3x3) with FP16 storage. There are\r\nseveral candidate solutions to this (tensorizing the batch gemm with\r\ncustom layouts closes the gap in several cases), but I haven't found a\r\nstrictly superior implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the existing NNPACK implementation in several ways:\r\n\r\n- Updates the NNPack.cmake file to build against current NNPACK (which\r\nhas several new dependencies, such as [cpuinfo](https://github.com/pytorch/cpuinfo/)).\r\n- Implements support for pre-transformed weights in the NNPACK bindings,\r\nwhich is crucial for optimal performance in several layers. A subsequent\r\nPR (already available in e.g.\r\nhttps://github.com/ajtulloch/tvm/tree/nnpack-precompute-ARM) exposes\r\nthis to `AlterOpLayout` to allow precomputation of weight transforms in\r\nthe `PrecomputePrune` stage.\r\n- Improves the threadpool configuration to correctly set a null\r\n`pthreadpool` instances in the `num_threads == 1` case, which allows the\r\ncalls to be executed directly on the calling thread as desired.\r\n- Improves the `nnpack.convolution_inference` wrapper to support passing\r\na batch of inputs, which in some cases provides superior performance to\r\ninvoking `nnpack.convolution_output`.\r\n- Supports `nnpack.convolution_inference` with and without a bias.\r\n- Improves unit test coverage for the various new functions described

patch is related to issue:\r\nhttps://discuss.tvm.ai/t/array-bounds-checking/944\r\n\r\nLets imagine simple example with out of bounds access:\r\n \r\n```\r\nn = tvm.var(\"n\")\r\n \r\n A = tvm.placeholder ((n,n,n), name='A')\r\n B = tvm.placeholder ((n,n,n), name='B')\r\n C = tvm.compute(A.shape, lambda i,j,k: A[i + 300][j][k] + B[i][j][k], name='C')\r\n s = tvm.create_schedule (C.op)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will get IR like this:\r\n```\r\n produce C {\r\n    for (i, 0, n) {\r\n      for (j, 0, n) {\r\n        for (k, 0, n) {\r\n          C[((((i*n) + j)*n) + k)] = (A[(((((i + 300)*n) + j)*n) + k)] + B[((((i*n) + j)*n) + k)])\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThis is actually out of the bounds access, this code could cause a segfault or access to \"junk\" memory since TMV has native runtime.\r\n\r\nCould we set for example, in debug mode, an instrumentation before every memory access with simple check and assert.  So at the runtime we can handle it, and make sure our model does not access any invalid memory.\r\n\r\n ```\r\nproduce C {\r\n    for (i, 0, n) {\r\n      for (j, 0, n) {\r\n        for (k, 0, n) {\r\n          if (((((((((i + 300)*n) + j)*n) + k) < ((n*n)*n)) && (((((i*n) + j)*n) + k) < ((n*n)*n))) && (((((i*n) + j)*n) + k) < ((n*n)*n)))) {\r\n            C[((((i*n) + j)*n) + k)] = (A[(((((i + 300)*n) + j)*n) + k)] + B[((((i*n) + j)*n) + k)])\r\n          } else {\r\n            assert(((((((((i + 300)*n) + j)*n) + k) < ((n*n)*n)) && (((((i*n) + j)*n) + k) < ((n*n)*n))) && (((((i*n) + j)*n) + k) < ((n*n)*n))), \"OUT OF BOUNDS\")\r\n            1\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I wrote the pass, which instruments bound check before potentially invalid memory access.\r\n\r\nThe pass could be enabled by option **instrument_bound_checkers=True**.\r\nThe idea is simple,\r\nat first we associate every buffer_var with actual Buffer shape, as far as I understood, in term of TVM buffer_var is like a pointer to actual Buffer, and then in special pass insert check before memory access.\r\nAlso new buffer could be created - we check it.\r\nSome buffers could increase size by allocate - we check it.\r\nCould have situation when optimization pass insert an intrinsic tvm.if_then_else - we check it.\r\n\r\nI think it could solve the problem mentioned in the issue. \r\n\r\nCould someone please review and give me any feedback.\r\nThanks.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-08T14:34:55Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T02:31:59Z","closed_at":"2018-11-30T02:31:59Z","merged_at":"2018-11-30T02:31:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f1d709f9c073e2b0f0b0822fd4db1d53c389fa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776288,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzYyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20review%20in%20progress","name":"status:

of #2017   This PR will remain open until Nov 12 to give sufficient time for feedbacks in the community\r\n\r\nTVM Community Guideline\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nTVM adopts the Apache style model and governs by merit. We believe that it is important to create an inclusive community where everyone can use, contribute to, and influence the direction of the project. See `CONTRIBUTORS.md <https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md>`_ for the current list of contributors.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Development Process\r\n---------------------------\r\nEveryone in the community is welcomed to send patches, documents, and propose new directions to the project. The key guideline here is to enable everyone in the community to get involved and participate the decision and development.  When major changes are proposed, an RFC should be sent to allow discussion by the community. We encourage public discussion, archivable channels such as issues, discuss, mail-list. So that everyone in the community can participate and review the process later.\r\n\r\nCode reviews are one of the key ways to ensure the quality of the code, High-quality code reviews prevent technical debt for long-term and are crucial to the success of the project. A pull request needs to be reviewed before it gets merged. A committer who has the expertise of the corresponding area would moderate the pull request and the merge the code when it is ready. The corresponding committer could request multiple reviewers who are familiar with the area of the code. We encourage contributors to request code reviews themselves and help review others code -- remember everyone is volunteering their time to the community, high-quality code review itself costs as much as the actual code contribution, you could get your code quickly reviewed if you do others the same favor. \r\n\r\nThe community should strive to reach a consensus on technical decisions through discussion. We expect committers and PMCs to moderate technical discussions in a diplomatic way, and provide suggestions with clear technical reasoning when necessary. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommitters\r\n----------\r\nCommitters are individuals who are granted the write access to the project. A committer is usually responsible for a certain area or several areas of the code where they oversee the code review process. The area of contribution can take all forms, including code contributions and code reviews, documents, education, and outreach. Committers are essential for a high quality and healthy project. The community actively look for new committers from contributors. Here is a list of useful traits that help the community to recognize potential committers:\r\n\r\n- Sustained contribution to the project, demonstrated by discussion over RFCs, code reviews and proposals of new features, and other development activities. Familiar with, and being able to take ownership on one or several areas of the project.\r\n- Quality of contributions: High-quality, readable code contributions indicated by pull requests that can be merged without a substantial code review.  History of creating clean, maintainable code and including good test cases. Informative code reviews to help other contributors that adhere to a good standard. \r\n- Community involvement: active participation in the discussion forum, promote the projects via tutorials, talks and other outreaches. We encourage committers to collaborate broadly, e.g. do code reviews and discuss designs with community members that they do not interact physically. \r\n\r\nThe Project Management Committee(PMC) consists group of active committers that moderate the discussion, manage the project release, and proposes new committer/PMC members. Potential candidates are usually proposed via an internal discussion among PMCs, followed by a consensus approval, i.e. least 3 +1 votes, and no vetoes. Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning. PMCs should serve the community by upholds the community practices and guidelines TVM a better community for everyone. PMCs should strive to identify new candidates outside of their own organization. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewers \r\n---------\r\nReviewers are individuals who actively contributed to the project and is willing to participate in the code review of new contributions. We identify reviewers from active contributors. The committers should explicitly solicit reviews from the reviewer.  High-quality code reviews prevent technical debt for long-term and are crucial to the success of the project. A pull request to the project has to be reviewed by a reviewer in order to be merged.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-08T05:29:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T20:26:50Z","closed_at":"2018-11-19T20:26:36Z","merged_at":"2018-11-19T20:26:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"7858a1ea7f17ec78be60135417f1b59c0c7f028d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":540459689,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDA0NTk2ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20RFC","name":"status:

PR adds a pass to VTA which extends the ISA to include tensor and tile identity info in DMA instructions.\r\n\r\nIn particular,\r\n* each tensor in a scope has its own global id. a tensor accessed from independent scopes has a single id\r\n* tiles are marked as being first or last\r\n\r\nA caveat is that this pass will error in the rare chance that a tensor is written to in a scope where it's already being read or written. This is really only problematic for `scan`. The solution is to give each tile its own ID, but I haven't figured out how to make a test case for that yet.","created_at":"2018-11-04T06:01:07Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T15:27:54Z","closed_at":"2019-05-08T15:27:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1150d120c6fdf4e52a9d16cafb01da55ca297725","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1103182903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAzMTgyOTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20inactive","name":"status:

PR attempts to clean up the interpreter and graph runtime compile by making interface consistent, and organize them into backend modules. It also added support of a CompileEngine that caches previously compiled the code and can be used as the backbone of AOT AND JIT. After this PR, I feel most of the compiler scaffolding is done for the graph compiler support.\r\n\r\n- [x] Move interpreter, graph runtime codegen to backend\r\n- [x] Introduce CompileEngine \r\n- [x] refactor Interpreter and graph runtime codegen to use CompileEngine\r\n- [x] change fuse_ops to create function inplace(not add to globalvar)\r\n- [x] Enhanced graph codegen to support tuple input/output case \r\n    - The original graph format can be viewed as always returning a tuple\r\n- [x] Make relay.build and relay.optimize consistent with nnvm.\r\n- [x] Change executor interface to also take in ctx and target\r\n   - Allows interpreter to optionally run gpu code\r\n\r\n### Notes on some observations I made during the refactor\r\n- The graph runtime codegen need to implement a memory allocator pass to enable reuse of memory.\r\n   - Will leave as a followup \r\n- The current interpreter don't memoize(and it is important not to because single Expr can evaluate to the different value given different input)\r\n   - It will cause explosive computation in pure data flow form.\r\n   - so it is important to run interpreter in after let binding transformation.\r\n   - We will likely need a liveness analysis to eagerly free memory in the interpreter if we hope to use it to run large networks.\r\n- It might be a good time to think about what would heterogeneous device support looks like as per (cc @zhiics)

is a minor set of commits to make TVM leak-sanitizer and Wnon-virtual-dtor clean. These are:\r\n\r\n- Stop leaking the `llvm::TargetMachine` instance (`Target::createTargetMachine` returns a raw pointer with owning semantics, so the caller is responsible for free'ing it). Instead, it is now owned by the `LLVMModule` instance.\r\n- Leak the `Manager::Global` singleton, instead of deleting it at program exit. This stops LSAN complaining about the leaked Registry* instances in `Manager::fmap`.\r\n- Add virtual destructors to `runtime::DSLAPI` and `codegen::CodeGenSourceBase`, to avoid LLVM complaining when `-Wnon-virtual-dtor` is passed (I think this is a useful flag to enable in CI as well).\r\n\r\nAfter these commits, TVM built with e.g. `-fsanitize=leak` raises no errors on `./tests/scripts/task_cpp_unittest.sh`.","created_at":"2018-10-31T23:41:42Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T04:38:55Z","closed_at":"2018-11-01T02:34:00Z","merged_at":"2018-11-01T02:34:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"0319f99d248e39521abd304690dcbc8d26d075c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:
