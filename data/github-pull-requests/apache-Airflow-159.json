But when mapping a task decorator, `my_task.map(my_val=[1, 2, 3])`, it’s the argument on _the function wrapped by the task object_ being mapped. Therefore, mapped (and also partial-ed) values for `my_val` should go into the `DecoratedOperator`’s `op_kwargs` (and `op_args`) arguments instead.\r\n\r\nAn end-to-end test is provided to validate the simplest case of this. Also fixed a test where the end-to-end test becomes broken after running a DAG (because I need to run a second DAG!)","created_at":"2022-02-04T14:29:21Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T16:49:53Z","closed_at":"2022-02-10T07:07:51Z","merged_at":"2022-02-10T07:07:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"fded2ca0b9c995737b401896b89e5c9fd7f24c91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

fixes an issue that can occur when a task is deferred and the resulting trigger completes before the executor is notified that the task was completed, whereby the rescheduling of the task fails since the executor refuses to enqueue a task which is already running.\r\n\r\nThe executor's tracking of running tasks is always lagging behind the task instance state but this is typically not a problem because tasks are not rescheduled fast enough for this to be a problem. But with deferred tasks and triggering logic, this picture changes since a trigger condition can in some cases be met right away – for example, checking whether a certain external system has a given state (i.e., \"sensoring\").\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution is to for example sleep for a small amount of time in the triggerer before changing the task state back to `SCHEDULED` – perhaps in the form of a minimum triggering duration to allow the executor to register that the initial task has completed.","created_at":"2022-02-04T07:39:04Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T07:22:28Z","closed_at":"2022-02-15T13:12:51Z","merged_at":"2022-02-15T13:12:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"2a6792d94d153c6f2dd116843a43ee63cd296c8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

latest release is `1.20.48`, but is currently constrained to be `<1.19.0`. \r\n\r\nThere was no reason given for pinning to `<1.19.0` in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/18389, and that PR was just bumping the pinning from `<1.18.0` to `<1.19.0`. \r\n\r\nMost other packages that are preemptively constrained to be less than a certain release are pinned to be less than a _major_ release.

PR will fixes a bug in aws mysql_to_s3 if the value in dataframe is a float it will convert to float if it is not then int.  It will use pd.Float64Dtype() for floats instead of using the the pd.Int64Dtype(). Since there could be floating-point values in the array this will fix the exception for safely casting the array to data type.\r\nfixes error when using mysql_to_s3 (TypeError: cannot safely cast non-equivalent object to int64)\r\n\r\ncloses: #16919\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#11177\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `template_fields_renderers` attr to many operators as well as adds a few more lexers for syntax highlighting in the UI:\r\n\r\n- `mysql`\r\n- `postgresql`\r\n- `tsql` (for Transact-SQL used in SQL Server)\r\n\r\n> Note: The `ddl_statements` arg in the Google Cloud Spanner operators would be a list and does not render correctly in the UI currently. The list of SQL renders as a typical Python list rather than being separated into individual SQL statements and rendered like in the Task Instance Details page.

recent release of FAB 3.4.4 has unblocked us from upgrading\r\nSQLAlchemy to 1.4.* version. We wanted to do it for quite some\r\ntime however upgrading to 1.4.* of sqlalchemy and allowing our\r\nusers to use it for 2.2.4 is a bit risky.\r\n\r\nWe are fixing resulting \"aftermath\" in the main branch and as\r\nof this commit there are two fixes merged and remaining MsSQL\r\nproblem. The MSSql problem does not affect 2.2.4 as MsSQL will\r\nbe available only starting from 2.3.0, however the two other\r\nproblems have shown that SQLAlchemy has a potential to break\r\nthings and we might want to test it more thoroughly before\r\nreleasing 2.3.0.\r\n\r\nThe problems in question are #21205 and #21228. Both were only\r\ntest problems but the indicate that there might be more hidden\r\nissues involved.\r\n\r\nIn order to limit risks, this PR proposes to limit SQLAlchemy\r\nfor 2.2.* to < 1.4.0. This will allow to upgrade FAB and\r\nrelated dependencies without opening up Airflow to upgrade to\r\nSQLAlchemy 1.4 (yet).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR simplifies and streamlines the pre-commits that require\r\nCI and BATS docker images to run. This is the result of\r\nupcoming CI/Breze rewrite from Bash to Python and recent\r\nimprovements in image caching.\r\n\r\nThe following simplifications and deletion are implemented:\r\n\r\n* BATS tests (amd all related code) are completely removed from both\r\n  Host and container we are removing Bash so those won't be needed\r\n\r\n* The 'build' test that prepared CI image if needed has been\r\n  removed (see below)\r\n\r\n* The 'mypy' and 'flake' images that require CI image, instead of\r\n  attempting to rebuild the image, will run on whatever image they\r\n  have, but they will warn that the image needs to be rebuilt\r\n  at earliest convenience.\r\n\r\n* In case the CI image has never been built locally, it will\r\n  be automaticaly pulled from ghcr.io latest image built on CI\r\n  without asking the user\r\n\r\n* Documentation is updated\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

that all the scripts in docker build are using direct bash\r\ncalling, shebang on those scripts is not needed (and harmful).\r\n\r\nSome of the IDEs and pre-commits will insist on making the

just the owner.\r\n\r\nRemoving both - executable bit and shebang will make sure there\r\nwill be no temptation to add the executable bit (thus the executable\r\nbit will not trigger cache

used to have two options in our CI - one was to build the\r\nimages in the \"build\" step and pull them in \"ci/tests\" steps, the\r\nother was to build the images in \"ci/tests\" steps as a backup,\r\nin case the build/ci workflows has some problems. It's likely been\r\na year or more when we did not have to use the other workflow and\r\nsince switching to GitHub Registry as cache it became extremely\r\nstable, which means that we can remove the option where the\r\nimages might be build \"on the spot\" in the CI/tests steps.\r\n\r\nThat involves few clarifications:\r\n\r\n* we can split `prepare` scripts into separate `pull` and `build`\r\n  ones\r\n* the steps with `Prepare` name (which was - either pull or build)\r\n  can use proper name (either Pull or Build)\r\n* GITHUB_REGISTRY_WAIT_FOR_IMAGE variable and corresponding\r\n  BUILD_IMAGES_OVERRIDE and debug secret to enable \"build in CI\"\r\n  flow can be removed\r\n* documentation is updated\r\n\r\nThis will also allow to easier implement the equivalent steps\r\nin the \"CI & Breeze\" override project, as the steps will be now\r\npossible to replace with corresponding breeze's build-image/\r\npull_image functions and calls.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

produces images for multiple versions. Sometimes we\r\nrelease several images for different versions close to one another\r\nwhen base Python image is the same. In those cases it would be\r\ngreat if images for different Airflow versions shared as much\r\nas possible of image layers - the \"base\" dependencies usually\r\ndo not change between versions so two images with the same Python\r\nversion could only start differring at the moment we start to\r\ninstall Airflow for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis change moves AIRFLOW_VERSION ARG declaration and ENV variable\r\nas late as possible, so that earlier layers in the Docker images are\r\nthe same for different Airflow image versions as long as the base\r\nPython image is the same.\r\n\r\nThis should decrease significantly used space if someone switches\r\nbetween two Airflow versions in the same system (for testing\r\nor when doing migration). It also should speed up cache\r\nrefreshing and rebuilding and decrease overall size of the cache\r\nused by multiple Airflow Images (especially when we are close\r\nto release (like we are now with Airlfow 2.2.4)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

failure.","created_at":"2022-01-29T21:19:31Z","updated_at":"2022-03-22T15:04:54Z","closed_at":"2022-02-28T22:41:40Z","merged_at":"2022-02-28T22:41:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"4ad21f5f7c2d416cf813a860564bc2bf3e161d46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

are various problems with executable bits in scripts used\r\nin different environments in docker builds:\r\n\r\n* depending on the umask of the Linux host system, group bits\r\n  might be set or not - this might lead to Docker cache\r\n  invalidation\r\n* on Windows host systems, when file is copied to Docker, the\r\n  executable bits might be lost when the file is copied to\r\n  docker context\r\n* when AUFS is used as backing storage changing executable bit\r\n  might lead to crashes if there is no extra sync\r\n* changing executable bit of the script leads to actual change\r\n  of the cache while building, which also might produce\r\n  cache invalidation\r\n\r\nAs the result we cannot rely on the executable bits of the scripts\r\nand cannot change them in the image either.\r\nThis change removes executable bits from the scripts for group and\r\nother, and executes all the docker scripts via `bash` command.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

order to do this there were a few required:\r\n\r\n- The BackfillJob needs to know about mapped tasks, both to expand them, and in order to update it's TI tracking\r\n- The DebugExecutor, task_command.py, LocalTaskJob needed to \"unmap\" the mapped task to get the real operator back at the right time.\r\n\r\nI was testing this with the following dag:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import task\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\nimport pendulum\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef make_list():\r\n    return list(map(lambda a: f'echo \"{a!r}\"', [1, 2, {'a': 'b'}]))\r\n\r\ndef consumer(*args):\r\n     print(repr(args))\r\n\r\nwith DAG(dag_id='maptest', start_date=pendulum.DateTime(2022, 1, 18)) as dag:\r\n    PythonOperator(task_id='consumer', python_callable=consumer).map(op_args=make_list())\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can't \"unmap\" decorated operators successfully yet, so we're using old-school PythonOperator\r\n\r\nWe also just pass the whole value to the operator, not just the current mapping value(s)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

releasing 3.4.4 we can finally migrate to SQLAlchemy 1.4,\r\nhowever SQLAlchemy 1.4 removed the use of postgres:// as valid\r\nspecification for Postgres DB SQL (leaving only postgresql://)\r\n\r\nDue to that we need to change:\r\n\r\n* postgres provider to return postgresql:// with get_db_uri()\r\n* fix a number of tests that expected postgres://\r\n\r\nWe cannot do much if someone uses postgres:// specification.\r\nTechnically it might be seen as breaking change, but this is not\r\nan airflow breaking change and users could still use SQLAlchemy\r\n1.3 to keep the old prefix, so we
