When both are checked there is also the option to show only the series totals `ONLY TOTAL` but if you want to see all of the values in the stacks you can uncheck `ONLY TOTAL`. \r\n\r\nWhen `ONLY TOTAL` is unchecked and the data that's being displayed have small or similar values, the chart labels can become cluttered and tend to sit on top of each other making them difficult to read.\r\n\r\nThe enhancement is to add an input where you can enter a minimum percentage threshold that would only display labels for values at or above the threshold. \r\n\r\nThere is an input just like this over in Pie Chart controls as mentioned and shown in the issue that is referenced at the top of this PR.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### SHORT DESCRIPTION\r\n- Added a `TextControl` Input for the percentage threshold to the Time-series echarts controls \r\n- Added logic in `transformProps` to conditionally render the labels if above that threshold\r\n- Added props to the Time-series Chart storybook story to show these changes\r\n- Added some tests for`transformProps` for the `showValue`, `onlyTotal`, and `percentageThreshold` props\r\n\r\n---\r\n### DETAILED DESCRIPTION\r\n### Control Config:\r\nThere was already a configuration called `showValueSection` that holds the other controls mentioned so I added the new control to that.\r\n\r\nI set the visibility to only be true if show_value is true, stack is true, and only_total is false. I also set the default to be 5% matching the control in the Pie Chart plugin because it seemed reasonable.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst percentageThresholdControl = {\r\n  name: 'percentage_threshold',\r\n  config: {\r\n    type: 'TextControl',\r\n    label: t('Percentage threshold'),\r\n    renderTrigger: true,\r\n    isFloat: true,\r\n    default: 5,\r\n    description: t(\r\n      'Minimum threshold in percentage points for showing labels.',\r\n    ),\r\n    visibility: ({ controls }: ControlPanelsContainerProps) =>\r\n      Boolean(controls?.show_value?.value) &&\r\n      Boolean(controls?.stack?.value) &&\r\n      Boolean(!controls?.only_total?.value),\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThe `showValueSection` controls are used in these Time Series Charts.\r\n- Area - (Time-series Area Chart)\r\n- Bar - (Time-series Bar Chart v2)\r\n- Regular - (Time-series Chart)\r\n- Line - (Time-series Line Chart)\r\n- Stepped Line - (Time-series Stepped Line)\r\n- Smooth Line - (Time-series Smooth Line)\r\n\r\nAll of these charts appear to benefit from this and they all share the same `transformProps` which is where the logic for these controls exist.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### The logic:\r\nWe grab the prop that is passed through `transformProps` by adding it to the list of variables deconstructed out of the `formData` prop.\r\n\r\nCreate an array matching the totalStackedValues array but with the calculated threshold value instead of the total.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    totalStackedValues.push(values);\r\n    thresholdValues.push((percentageThreshold / 100) * values);\r\n```\r\n\r\nPass that down to `transformSeries` when it is gets called on all the series. Then within that function go on down to where the `onlyTotal` prop is being checked\r\n\r\nBEFORE:\r\n```javascript\r\n        if (!stack || !onlyTotal || isSelectedLegend) {\r\n            return formatter(numericValue);\r\n        }\r\n        if (seriesIndex === showValueIndexes[dataIndex]) {\r\n          return formatter(totalStackedValues[dataIndex]);\r\n        }\r\n        return '';\r\n```\r\n\r\nBreaking it down super simply, this \r\n- returns the series values when NOT stacked or NOT set to show only totals\r\n- or\r\n- returns the series total when necessary\r\n- or\r\n- returns empty string\r\n\r\n\r\nWith our `thresholdValues` we can take separate out `!onlyTotal`. Then check if the value is greater than or equal to the matching threshold value and return the value or an empty string accordingly.\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n```javascript\r\n        if (!stack || isSelectedLegend) return formatter(numericValue);\r\n        if (!onlyTotal) {\r\n          if (numericValue >= thresholdValues[dataIndex]) {\r\n            return formatter(numericValue);\r\n          }\r\n          return '';\r\n        }\r\n        if (seriesIndex === showValueIndexes[dataIndex]) {\r\n          return formatter(totalStackedValues[dataIndex]);\r\n        }\r\n        return '';\r\n```\r\n---\r\n### Test cases\r\nAdded tests for transformProps to test whether props are being successfully transformed. I couldn't find tests for the other showValue controls so I added a couple for them because I was in the area.\r\n\r\nAdded test cases for:\r\n- 'should show labels when showValue is true'\r\n- 'should not show labels when showValue is false'\r\n- 'should show only totals when onlyTotal is true'\r\n- 'should show labels on values >= percentageThreshold if onlyTotal is false'\r\n- 'should not apply percentage threshold when showValue is true and stack is false'\r\n\r\nAnother thing with the tests is that there were a few different TypeScript errors already in `Timeseries/transformProps.test.ts` so I did what I could to get them to calm down.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Moving Forward\r\nI wanted to share more thoughts that I had on this feature but feel free to skip over this because it is just ideas. \r\n\r\nThe TextControl, which is an Antd Input component, works perfectly well but I would say that ideally, we wouldn't want to use a plain input for this control. A percentage can only be between 0 and 100 and the input allows the opportunity to put any numbers into but there isn't a built-in way to add a min and max.\r\n\r\nWe could add this to the TextControl but I am not the biggest fan of doing this because Antd has the InputNumber component that does have the ability to set a min and max number value. While InputNumber is used in some other places in other controls like with the Y axis bounds, it doesn't appear to have its own control component like the plain Input does with TextControl. I could be wrong about this and if I am please let me know because I would love to try and utilize it for this.\r\n\r\n[Antd InputNumber link](https://ant.design/components/input-number/)\r\n\r\nI also did a version of this with the SliderControl because it felt like it could be a good choice because it has a set range. I ended up deciding against suggesting it for now because it updates the state on `onChange` and that will update on every 'step' in between the starting number and where it ends. Those state updates rerender the chart and it happens a lot it which makes an unpleasantly sluggish experience.\r\n\r\nI believe we could easily get around this by using the prop `onAfterChange` which is present on Antd slide. The component is currently only using `onChange` but it wouldn't be too hard to have it take the function passed to `onChange` and move it to `onAfterChange` if needed. We could do this by adding an optional boolean value called something like `updateAfterChange` and if that is true then change the function to run after the change. I haven't tested this so it might not be quite that simple.\r\n\r\nI should probably note that `onAfterChange` runs after `onmousup` fires. So it would run when the user is done dragging the slider to the desired value and not for every value in between.\r\n\r\n[Antd Slider link](https://ant.design/components/slider/)\r\n\r\nThere is also another option that is shown in the examples on the Slider page where it uses both Slider and InputNumber at the same time while sharing the same state and min/maxes. I liked this one the best because it has both an input and a slider at the same time. \r\n\r\nThis would require a new control to be made that would combine the two as shown in the Antd Slider examples. I am not sure if this would be useful outside of the Pie Chart and the Time-series charts so it might not be worth making. \r\n\r\nFinal thoughts for percentage threshold control are:\r\n1. Change the TextControl to be able to have a min-max value for numbers\r\n2. Set up a control for InputNumber\r\n3. Use SliderControl but have state update onAfterChange\r\n4. Set up a conjoined Slider InputNumber control and use that\r\n\r\nThese are just ideas though and I am probably wrong about the way to implement them but I figured it wouldn't hurt to share.\r\n\r\n---\r\n---\r\n### BEFORE - BAR\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1271\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 9 07 50 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/146306557-60349055-236e-4c2b-b2bd-81ef722e33e2.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### AFTER - BAR\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1271\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 9 10 19 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/146306698-1ec8464d-1507-4929-99b9-6dacb0331e50.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE - LINE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1278\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 9 21 00 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/146307568-50e37712-cdd1-4e4d-979e-157fc973be0e.png\">\r\n\r\n### AFTER - LINE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1278\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 9 22 26 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/146307702-6ed24a88-94c4-4040-8af7-6bdd9038920c.png\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Doesn't show when stacked is false**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"344\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 9 13 27 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/146306932-aa9f701c-44a6-4b18-9bc6-a7366b951588.png\">\r\n\r\n**Doesn't show when stacked is true and only total is true**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"344\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 9 11 59 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/146306829-cb101002-df78-48a4-8690-29e1680c5135.png\">\r\n\r\n**Shows when stacked is true and only total is false**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"344\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-15 at 9 12 32 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/146306849-f07ab8b5-d637-44f2-9209-bec6e6c71e2e.png\">\r\n---\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- Open Superset and navigate to Charts\r\n- Open up a chart that once stacked would have tightly packed and similar values. I found that Rise & Fall of Video Game Consoles - Area Chart is a good starting place for this\r\n- Change the Visualization Type to be one of these: (I suggest Time-series Chart because you can switch between all)\r\n  - Time-series Area Chart\r\n  - Time-series Bar Chart v2\r\n  - Time-series Chart\r\n  - Time-series Line Chart\r\n  - Time-series Stepped Line\r\n  - Time-series Smooth Line\r\n- Make sure you have the `groupby` value set to something with a lot of values. If using Rise & Fall of Video Game Consoles you can leave it on platform or change it to publisher if you are feeling extra spicy\r\n- Click the `Customize` tab at the top and scroll to `Chart Options`\r\n- If you are using Time-series Chart I would suggest changing the Series Style to `Bar`\r\n- Check `SHOW VALUE` and `STACK SERIES`, then uncheck `ONLY TOTAL`\r\n- If all goes well you should see the `PERCENTAGE THRESHOLD` input appear with a value of 5\r\n\r\nI would turn on `DATA ZOOM` too so you can get a better look at the values. \r\n\r\nOther than that check it out however you see fit. Maybe check out all the charts mentioned above. \r\n\r\nI found it most useful with the bar chart but it seems to be useful on all of them\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nNote: This is a PR into a feature branch, not into master. #17530 \r\n\r\nThis is the second of the embedded dashboard (#17187) access control PRs. The first dealt with authentication, creating and reading the guest token and setting up a guest user. This one adds new rules to allow guest users access to authorized dashboards.\r\n\r\nWe haven't added an embedded dashboard model, yet. So for now, if the `EMBEDDED_SUPERSET` flag is on, all dashboards are considered \"embeddable\" if the guest token permits access. That means that the id used is the id of the dashboard. In the future, the id in the token will reference a row of the `embedded_dashboards` table instead, and some of these checks will need to be modified.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe bug: When a user saved a dashboard that contained a chart with non-ascii characters, the json_metadata became malformed, causing the dashboard to fail to load. The root cause is in #17570, which added `positions` into the json_metadata blob. Something went wrong in the json parsing which causes json_metadata to be truncated if the positions json contains emojis or other non-standard characters.\r\n\r\nThe root cause PR is pretty large, so we had trouble figuring out where this goes wrong. I suspect the fix forward is some combination of\r\n* Fix json parsing to handle non-ascii characters correctly\r\n* Validate that json_metadata is well-formed before writing it\r\n* Don't write the `positions` json, since it's already contained by a different column\r\n\r\nOpening this revert PR as a starting point. This PR reverts #17570 and the accompanying #17707.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nto reproduce bug:\r\n* make dashboard\r\n* add chart with emoji in title\r\n* save dashboard\r\n* see error after save\r\n* refresh and see error on load\r\n\r\nto verify this fix:\r\n* make dashboard\r\n* add chart with emoji in title\r\n* save dashboard\r\n* verify dashboard saved\r\n* refresh and view dashboard\r\n\r\n###

error message on a failed import.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/17706\r\nshortcut: https://app.shortcut.com/preset/story/33378/explore-south-tables-view-sample-will-show-no-data-when-user-drop-column-and-did-not-sync-column-in-edit-data-set\r\n\r\nCurrently, Superset generates cache key by ```query object``` that contains columns, calculated columns, metrics, etc. If a column had been removed from the source table and it hadn't been removed in Superset, it wouldn't have raised errors, it would have returned the \"dirty data\" from the cache system.\r\n\r\nThis PR\r\n1. introduces ```force query``` when the user clicks `sample tab`.\r\n2. raise an HTTP exception when happen a query error in legacy API.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### After\r\n<img width=\"1366\" alt=\"image\"

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Go to SQLLab, make a duplicate table from the example database\r\n```SQL\r\ncreate table backup_birth_names as (select * from birth_names)\r\n```\r\n2. Add ```backup_birth_names``` as a Dataset\r\n3. Go to Explore, select `table` as viz type, select `count(*)` to metric control\r\n4. Open `data pane` and click `Samples` tab\r\n5. Save this Chart, named by \"test-chart\"\r\n6. Go to SQLLab, remove a column from the source table\r\n```SQL\r\nalter table backup_birth_names drop column name;\r\n```\r\n7. Open ```test-chart``` again\r\n8. Open `data pane` and click `Samples` tab, you can see the error like:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/146031169-16737d4c-4ee8-4230-97d7-c7a42722728e.png)\r\n9. Go to `edit dataset` model, click `sync columns from source` from `columns` tab\r\n10. Open `data pane` and click `Samples` tab, you can see the new sample from the source table.\r\n\r\nPlease use a LEGACY chart(for instance Area Chart) to test again, because there are different API from the new chart(nvd3) and the legacy chart(table, pivot table v2, echart).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen exporting a dataset, the `extra` attribute in columns was being exported as a plain string, instead of parsing the JSON. This would result in YAML like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- column_name: city\r\n  ...\r\n  extra: '{\"foo\": \"bar\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- column_name: city\r\n  ...\r\n  extra:\r\n    foo: bar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n1. Fixes the export, so that we get the more readable format.\r\n2. Fixes the import, so that both formats are accepted.\r\n\r\n(I also noted that the dataset `extra` attribute is not being parsed from JSON, and both import/export assume it's a string. I'll improve it in a next PR, exporting as an object and importing both formats.)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCopying more of the documentation to the Docusaurus directory.\r\n\r\nContent:\r\n- All `Installation and Configuration` pages\r\n- All `Connecting to Databases` pages\r\n- All `Miscellaneous` pages\r\n\r\nPretty straightforward on this one. Just continuing with the same structure as the current documentation site has.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that I made it so every filename is the same as its route extension which is the default behavior with docusaurus. For instance the file for the route `/db-connection-ui` is `db-connection-ui.mdx`.\r\n\r\nThere are different naming conventions for a couple of these files in the v1 docs folder but most matched this convention. So I kept it consistent when adding the content.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I should have done it a different way or if anybody wants it changed\r\n\r\nI also added any png images being displayed into `static/img`\r\n\r\n---\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nNavigate to docs-v2 directory and run `yarn` and then `yarn start` to spin up the docs site\r\n\r\nOpen the docsV2 site and click through the sidebar pages and compare to the current documentation site\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen importing a dashboard the list of immune chart IDs might contain a chart that was removed from the dashboard, while the ID remained inside `immune`. This will result in an error when importing the dashboard.\r\n\r\nI fixed it by ignoring IDs for charts that are not present in the dashboard. Ideally we should also fix the export so that these IDs are not present, and also improve the logic so that when a chart is removed from the dashboard its ID is also removed from `immune` if present.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nMostly just copy-pasting contents of markdown files from docs to docsV2.\r\n\r\nPages:\r\n- Frequently Asked Questions\r\n- Contribution Guide\r\n- Roadmap\r\n- API\r\n- Security\r\n\r\n\r\n### NOTEWORTHY\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Frontmatter\r\n\r\nI removed some variables from the markdown pages frontmatter because Docusaurus doesn't need or use it\r\n\r\nEx in v1 docs/frequently-asked-questions:\r\n```\r\n---\r\nname: Frequently Asked Questions\r\ntitle: Frequently Asked Questions\r\nroute: /docs/frequently-asked-questions\r\n---\r\n```\r\nname:\r\n- Docusaurus doesn't mention this variable and I couldn't find it used anywhere\r\n\r\nroute: \r\n- Docusaurus will set the route to be the file name by default and doesn't use this variable to change that\r\n- If we want the route to be different than the file name we would use `id: different-name` or `slug: /different/path/to/file`\r\n\r\nI also added some variables to better match the v1 docs\r\n\r\nEx in v2 docs/frequently-asked-questions:\r\n```\r\n---\r\ntitle: Frequently Asked Questions\r\nhide_title: true\r\nsidebar_position: 6\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\ntitle/hide_title:\r\n- Docusaurus uses the title variable to set the content of the tab title in the sidebar and the title in the HTML head metadata\r\n- If you don't have a `# Level 1 header` on the page it will add one to the top of the page with the title as its content\r\n- v1 docs use `## Level 2 header` for its headers and the size of the `# Level 1 header` is a lot bigger so `hide_title: true` will tell Docusaurus not to add the level 1 header. \r\n\r\nsidebar_position:\r\n- Used to specify its tab position in the sidebar\r\n\r\n---\r\n---\r\n### API page using SwaggerUI and Antd Design\r\n\r\n`/docs/api.mdx`\r\n\r\nSwaggerUI:\r\n- Needs the `swagger-ui-react` dependency and that needs the `buffer` and `stream` dependencies. So I added them with `yarn add`\r\n- The `buffer` needs to be declared and added using `import { Buffer } from \"buffer\"; global.Buffer = Buffer;` So I added that to the file. It is global so it could be added to the topmost file but since it is only relevant to this file I felt it made sense.\r\n- Docusaurus styles clashed with some of SwaggerUIs so I added some CSS to `css/custom.css` to fix it and make it look like the v1 docs\r\n- I also pulled over some CSS styles from v1 docs that hide the authorization and \"try it out\" mode.\r\n- Added a `TODO:` to fix the styling issues that SwaggerUI has with Docusauruses dark mode. It seems the SwaggerUI styles are more specific than the dark mode ones so we might need to hunt them all down and create more specific styling. I can add a ticket to the board for this.\r\n- SwaggerUI needed the `openapi.json` superset data so I copied that over and added it to `static/resources/openapi.json`. The folder `/static` seemed to be the appropriate place and since it was in a resources folder in v1 docs I did the same here.\r\n\r\nNew dependencies and their version numbers for reference\r\n```\r\n\"swagger-ui-react\": \"^4.1.2\",\r\n\"buffer\": \"^6.0.3\",\r\n\"stream\": \"^0.0.2\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nAntd Design:\r\n\r\nThe v1 docs have the `antd` dependency and it's mostly used for creating the layout except for this `Alert` component on the API page. I wasn't sure if we will be using Antd because there is already a layout and since this is the only place in the markdown content that I could find one used, I decided to hold off on adding the dependency. I commented out the component and the import until we know if we want/need to add it.\r\n\r\nFor now, I just used the Infima info alert class that is included in Docusaurus because it matches the sites current styling\r\n\r\nI did add Antd locally and its CSS styles wreck most of the Docusaurus dark mode styles. This also influenced my decision to hold off on adding the dependency because I think the dark mode is pretty cool.\r\n\r\n---\r\n---\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nA recent PR #17290 bumped Psycopg2 from 2.8.5 to 2.9.1, which features many changes to how timezones are handled: https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2021/06/16/psycopg-29-released/. Most notable is the change replacing the internal `FixedOffsetTimezone` class with the regular `datetime.timezone` when creating `datetime` objects, which is the \"normal behavior\" when working with datetimes. As a consequence, the constructor call to `cursor.tzinfo_factory` previously received the offset in minutes, while it now receives it as a `datetime.timedelta` object. As the custom `FixedOffsetTimezone` was only needed to make the timezone serializable by PyArrow, we can now remove it, as `datetime` objects containing a `timezone` `tzinfo` are serializable by PyArrow:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pyarrow as pa\r\n>>> from datetime import datetime, timezone\r\n>>> buf = pa.serialize(datetime(year=2021, month=1, day=1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)).to_buffer()\r\nsys:1: FutureWarning: 'pyarrow.serialize' is deprecated as of 2.0.0 and will be removed in a future version. Use pickle or the pyarrow IPC functionality instead.\r\n>>> pa.deserialize(buf)\r\nsys:1: FutureWarning: 'pyarrow.deserialize' is deprecated as of 2.0.0 and will be removed in a future version. Use pickle or the pyarrow IPC functionality instead.\r\ndatetime.datetime(2021, 12, 10, 0, 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow running the query `SELECT TO_TIMESTAMP('2019-12-10 01:00:00.000000', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.US')\r\n` works just fine:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/145578695-02313d69-a6f3-44ac-a122-0e2d55370831.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously it failed with the following error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/145578799-f5bf9f5c-da20-477e-90a1-77cf2219595c.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen creating a screenshot for an alert we should bypass the cache. This PR changes the alert jobs to pass `force=true` when fetching a screenshot, and also implements the logic to carry the `force` parameter through the stack.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nI added unit tests to the backend and frontend.\r\n\r\nTo test locally:\r\n\r\n1. Set up an alert that triggers (eg, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bart_lines` and `>0`).\r\n2. Check that the celery worker takes a screenshot with `?force=true` (you can see it in the logs).\r\n3. Click the link, the image should open fullscreen and bypassing the cache.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

longurl problem in dashboard when a user has a lot of filters and shares the url with other users. The long copied url had the potential to break loading the dashboard. This pr uses the new keyvalue api for dashboard to replace the datamask content with secure hashed key. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nbefore\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17326228/145321730-ad7048c7-cd34-4b8c-b3a6-1d74f595bf22.mov\r\n\r\nafter\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17326228/145322047-cd7cc9d4-7af3-472d-bf9a-3b40cc1cc38a.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nGo to a dashboard and create filters.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nI decided to convert some integration tests to unit tests. The low hanging fruit for this are the `sqlparse` tests, since they're self contained, so I decided to start there.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I created my first test, I found a bug. I changed the SQL:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM tbname\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM table_name\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the test failed to identify `table_name` as a table in the query, since it's a [reserved word](https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/blob/23d29933ddc4272b495d36e0e32d3eaf0c3ef76d/sqlparse/keywords.py#L557) in `sqlparse`.\r\n\r\nI fixed the problem, and converted all the integration tests.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nIn general, superset can be extended by supplying alternative FLASK_APP environment variable, or by defining APP_INITIALIZER in config. \r\n\r\nin case there is a need to extend the

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR changes the dashboard filters state endpoint to only allow `PUT` and `DELETE` for the owners of the dashboard filter state. If someone else tries to issue these operations, a `403` is returned. The main objective of this change is to prevent other users from overriding the owner's state.\r\n\r\nTwo more tests were added to include the new rules: `test_put_not_owner` and `test_delete_not_owner`\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Execute all tests\r\n2 - All tests should pass\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nA recent PR #17419 enabled global escaping of the colon character in queries, as the majority of SQLAlchemy dialects support escaping the colon character (see #17098 why this is needed). Escaping has been verified to work correctly on Postgres, MySql, MSSQL, Sqlite, BigQuery, Druid, Hive and Redshift, so it appears safe to assume escaping is supported on the majority of dialects. However, PyAthena does not, and adds the escape character to the final query, which breaks any query containing a colon character.\r\n\r\nTo support literal colons in queries, but fix the regression for Athena, this PR adds a flag `allows_escaped_colons` to `BaseEngineSpec`, which defaults to `True`, and is set to `False` in `PyAthenaSpec`. Relevant unit tests are added to the `BaseEngineSpec` and `AthenaEngineSpec`. In addition, all athena integration tests are converted to unit tests in pytest format.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently adding a virtual table with the query `select '123:456' as test_str` and then adding a Custom SQL query `test_str = '123:456'` generates the following query on Athena (notice the backslash before the colon characters):\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT \"test_str\" AS \"test_str\"\r\nFROM\r\n  (select '123\\:456' as test_str) AS \"virtual_table\"\r\nWHERE ((test_str = '123\\:456'))\r\nLIMIT 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor comparison, the same virtual table + filter produces the following on Postgres + all other tested databases:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT test_str AS test_str\r\nFROM\r\n  (select '123:456' as test_str) AS virtual_table\r\nWHERE ((test_str = '123:456'))\r\nLIMIT 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. create a virtual table `select '123:456' as test_str` referencing an Athena database\r\n2. Create a chart based on the virtual table and add a filter `test_str = '123:456'`\r\n3. Notice how the rendered query has escaped both the subquery and where clause\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis test was flaky, sometimes failing with `AssertionError: 'now' != 'a second ago'` [as seen here](https://github.com/apache/superset/runs/4400683801?check_suite_focus=true#step:8:1843) because time actually does continue to pass while the test runs. I've changed it to an assertion that should basically not flake unless you're really, really, really unlucky.\r\n\r\nDownside: it now depends on an implementation detail of humanize, but I'm okay with that tradeoff.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWorking on fixing the issues with row limits, series limits, and other select options being sorted by their label instead of their number value. These are in the Explore view but the select component is used all over the place.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\nSome options are being sorted funky and there is other weirdness happening. I have implemented a fix that will sort the numbers but there may be better ways to do it. I am currently enumerating over files where select is being used and I am working on a solution that will satisfy all of options that get passed while not unnecessarily bloating or increasing the complexity of the component or codebase.\r\n\r\n### What's happening:\r\nSo far I have figured out that the defaultSortOperator from Select (`superset-frontend/src/components/Select/Select.tsx`) (pictured below) is sorting the options being passed in to by their label if the options have a label that is `typeof 'string'`. The problem is that the numbers that are being passed in with a string label and a number value ex: `{ label: '20', value: 20 }`.\r\nWhen the `Select` is inside of a `SelectControl` (`superset-frontend/src/explore/components/controls/SelectControl.jsx`) like it is when it is being used for viz plugins, the numbers are always being passed in with a label thanks to formatting.\r\n\r\nSo the below function is comparing a.label to b.label and sorting the numbers by their labels because from what I have been able to find, there aren't any (many?) scenarios that numbers are being passed in without a label.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst defaultSortComparator = (a: AntdLabeledValue, b: AntdLabeledValue) => {\r\n  if (typeof a.label === 'string' && typeof b.label === 'string') {\r\n    return a.label.localeCompare(b.label);\r\n  }\r\n  if (typeof a.value === 'string' && typeof b.value === 'string') {\r\n    return a.value.localeCompare(b.value);\r\n  }\r\n  return (a.value as number) - (b.value as number);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nIf you are like me you are probably thinking, \"Okay cool, then let's change that default operator to compare by value when the value is a number\". The problem I found with this is that there is at least one other implementation of Select ( I currently only know of the Dataset selection in the Charts view) where label is a string with a title and the value is a number. So doing that changes those options to be sorted by their number value causing the options to appear out of order. I have not looked into what is going on there but I am assuming that the numbers serve a good purpose like an index for an API call to the backend. \r\n\r\n### ~~Current Fix~~ (New Implementation in Update 1):\r\nThe fix that has makes the most sense to me, with my current knowledge and understanding of what's happening, is to utilize the `propertyComparator` function right below `defaultSortComparator` as the default sort function used and add an optional property called `sortByProperty` to Select that's default value is `'label'` that I call and assign to sortOperator property on Select like so `sortComparator = propertyComparator(sortByProperty)`. This will have the default sorting be done by label and allow the option to pass in a string property value to sort by a specific property.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexport const propertyComparator =\r\n  (property: string) => (a: AntdLabeledValue, b: AntdLabeledValue) => {\r\n    if (typeof a[property] === 'string' && typeof b[property] === 'string') {\r\n      return a[property].localeCompare(b[property]);\r\n    }\r\n    return (a[property] as number) - (b[property] as number);\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works for the cases where we getting viz plugins like MixedTimeSeries as long as we add the sortBy value into the control configurations for the data visualizations as well as pass the prop down into Select after it is passed into SelectControl. \r\n\r\nThis also would allow us to remove the `defaultSortComparator` function and also remove where `propertyComparator` is being imported into some components and just pass in the property to Select as a string. I have had `defaultSortComparator` commented out for a while and haven't noticed anything but certainly doesn't mean something didn't break. I am planning to find every implementation of Select and check all the options being passed in. I will also manually test this.\r\n\r\nNo matter what ends up being the solution to this, I believe it is a must to add more tests to all of the current tests it has to verify that it works with numbers as expected. \r\n\r\n \r\n## ~~IMPORTANT~~ (Addressed in Update 1)\r\n\r\nI am not sure about my solution and the more that I am looking into this, the more I am noticing other issues and getting more ideas. All of this directly involves the Select component and its sort functionality, so it feels appropriate to attempt to fix it or at the very least try to get an idea of what's happening so I can help somebody else do so. Also, I have not gone through and added this property to all the viz configurations that would use it yet because I am still researching.\r\n\r\n- The number arrays that are being passed in are constant variables that are starting out sorted and then are being unsorted by the Select component once they get passed in. It might make sense to have the sorting be optional because not all options being rendered make sense when sorted. Like for instance Dates, and that brings me to the next thing.\r\n- Dates are sent in sorted from smallest time to largest time and are then sorted by label and displayed unsorted. I am of the opinion that dates should go from smallest to largest but with these, we can't sort by either label or value because neither would work or make sense. This is what the label and value look like for some `{label: \"Hour\", value: \"PT1H\"}, {label: \"Minute\", value: \"PT1M\"}`. I feel these should not be sorted once they get into the Select or we could create a constant object that holds key:value pairs of the date option value and a corresponding size and then use that within the comparator function. But I don't like that idea because it would still involve having to know if the options are dates once they go in or we would have to write logic to check the options if they are dates and that feels, I dunno, gross and stupid? (I am very mature)\r\n- There is another bug with the Select component where the sort order breaks upon selection if it has multiple selections enabled. On single mode it will close the component and the next time you open it it will be in order, but with multiple on it stays open after selecting an option and immediately changes the options to be out of order. This is weird and unexpected and it feels like it might have something to do with the sorting. I will attempt to fix this as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n<img width=\"469\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-12-02 at 3 50 53 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis fixes a 500 error when running a pivot table v2 report on a chart with multiple columns and no rows\r\nOn a pandas dataframe stack function:\r\nif the columns have a single level, the output is a Series;\r\nif the columns have multiple levels, the new index level(s) is (are) taken from the prescribed level(s) and the output is a DataFrame.\r\n\r\nFor a chart with multiple columns, a dataframe does not have the `to_frame` method, and was erroring.\r\nThis pr checks for the return type of `stack` before calling `to_frame`\r\n\r\nSecond fix: some charts that have null values were having problems when pivoting because pandas will drop some data and then later filtering and manipulation can cause errors. I resolved this by filling in null values with a \"NULL\" string. \r\n\r\n*some work still needs to be done to improve the formatting of a pivot chart report with multiple columns.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate a chart with pivot v2 with multiple columns and no rows and make sure that a chart as both a csv and table can be sent as a report.\r\nCreate a pivot v2 chart with a column of all null values and select that as a chart column. Reports should send correctly for csv and test.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe dataset metric PUT schema is missing a few key fields, namely `extra`, `verbose_name` and `uuid`. In addition, the fields `extra` and `uuid` on the column schema have incorrect types, causing schema validation errors. This PR fixes the errors and adds relevant tests that would fail on master.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe were some recent changes that are causing an error when reading a query context that has a dataset id tied to a dataset that does not exist. In the case where we found this error, the invalid dataset id was caused by exporting query_context which was then exporting the dataset id instead of a uuid or something that could be transferred from one superset instance to another. So this PR removes the query_context from export and import and also does not throw an error if a chart tries to read the query_context and hits a dataset not found error. \r\n\r\nIn the near future, we should think about cleaning up any existing query contexts in a migration or script that point to a dataset that does not exist. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nexport a dashboard with charts that have query_context and import them. When loading the dashboard in the new instance, there should be no errors. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

SUMMARY\r\nAdds a config flag `ENABLE_BROAD_ACTIVITY_ACCESS` that makes it possible to disable access to other users' recent activity data, both via the API and the profile page. In addition, a security manager method `raise_for_user_activity_access` is introduced to make it possible to fine tune who can and can't access recent activity data.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nWhen the flag is set to false, trying to access other users' activity data returns a 403 which is displayed on the profile page tables with the message \"Access to user activity data is restricted\" (in the screenshot the user is viewing another user's profile page):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/144017932-d76b7604-d514-4f18-998a-9fd0d9a8d59f.png)\r\n\r\nWith the default settings, accessing other users' activity data is allowed (current behavior unchanged):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/144018164-714df161-74b9-4444-aba8-17d5acc62064.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. set `ENABLE_BROAD_ACTIVITY_ACCESS = False` in `superset_config.py`\r\n2. login as `admin`\r\n3. create a user `test`\r\n3. go to `/superset/profile/test`\r\n4. notice the message \"Access to user activity data is restricted\" in all activity tables\r\n5. comment out `ENABLE_BROAD_ACTIVITY_ACCESS` flag in `superset_config.py`\r\n6. go to `/superset/profile/test`\r\n7.  notice that access is unrestricted\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR's goal is to make the legacy Big Number chart plugin not-so-legacy-anymore.\r\n\r\nFirst improvement is migrating the chart endpoint from legacy to V1 API. This change will also allow proper handling of timestamp format metrics. The legacy API assumed that metric result is always a number - if you used a metric that should return a datetime (e.g. `MAX(temporal_column)`) with a db that returns dates as strings (like sqlite or druid), you'd get nulls in response (see screenshots).\r\n\r\nSecond thing - to render the trendline, we used `@data-ui/xy-chart` library, which hasn't been maintained for 2 years. I replaced it with Echarts, which is our go-to viz library.\r\n\r\nLastly, the legacy plugin wasn't able to handle rolling aggregates properly if values were missing. The new version ensures that rolling windows are resampled with null values when a time grain is used to ensure that the calculation window always has the correct number of lagged values applied.\r\n\r\nDB migration benchmark results:\r\n```\r\nCurrent: 0.42 s\r\n10+: 0.33 s\r\n100+: 0.30 s\r\n1000+: 0.30 s\r\n10000+: 0.42 s\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/144034565-8987a193-fee1-4f2a-a774-b9a4e3f14f6b.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/144034282-1fcab02a-ddf8-4e89-beb0-0cd064c40308.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nBig Number and Big Number with Trendline core functionalities should work like before.\r\nTimestamp metrics should be formatted automatically.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce bug shown on screenshots:\r\n1. Create a BigNumber or Big Number with Trendline chart using SQLite or Druid datasource\r\n2. Create a metric that should return a date (like `MAX(temporal_column)`)\r\n3. Verify that Big Number and Trendline are rendered properly, and that big number and trendline's tooltip are formatted as a date\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with
