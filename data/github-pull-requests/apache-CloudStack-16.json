Description\r\n\r\nUploading a local volume is made possible through the API `getUploadParamsForVolume`. However, the UI still shows this button even if the user's role does not have access to this API, returning the error 404 if the user tries to press it. A validation was added to hide this button when the user does not have permission to use the API.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow up of the discussion we had in the thread \r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread/qvb3kx78m7lvc21d90ld00v8o8wd27ro\r\n\r\nFor changes in database `VIEW`s, currently, we have to look at the changes in the previous `schema` files and replicate the whole `CREATE VIEW` command in the current `schema` file, modifying what we need (adding/removing columns, and so on). This process makes the changes in a `VIEW` to be distributed through several files, increasing the number of lines modified for simple changes (e.g.: for adding a single field to the `VIEW` result we need to replicate the whole command); thus, making it difficult to maintain and track.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, the proposal is to, instead of adding the `VIEW` changes to the  `schema` files, we manage them in a separated file (or several files). That would allow us to easily track `VIEW` modifications, as we would just change the `VIEW` declaration in the same file, instead of re-declaring the whole `VIEW` in a different file; and we would have a better history of the changes. Also, we would not need to migrate all `VIEW`s right away; we could migrate as we change them (I already created some files according to what was changed in 4.18). \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI created an environment from scratch and observed the upgrade logs:

Description\r\n\r\nThe `ResourceType` enum, which is part of the `Resource` interface, includes an argument called `supportedOwners` that is used to indicate which types of owners are supported - either Domain, Account or both. However, every type of owner enumerated is supported by both options, making this validation unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis argument has been removed, along with its getter method.\r\n\r\n### Types of

Description\r\nThis feature allows the storage migration for ScaleIO volumes between the ScaleIO storage pools of the same and different ScaleIO storage clusters. Previously this operation was blocked and now we are allowing it from API/UI.\r\n\r\nThe volume migration within the same storage cluster is performed using ScaleIO’s native V-Tree migration operation where the volume will be live migrated to another storage pool. The volume migration across the different storage cluster is performed using libvirt’s live blockcopy operation which will first copy the volume to the destination storage pool and after a successful copy, the source volume will be deleted.

Description\r\n\r\nDuring the start of a stopped VM when there is not enough capacity in the current cluster CloudStack can migrate it to a new cluster. This can be an expensive operation when Cluster scope storage is used as migration can be carried out using SSVM and secondary storage.\r\nThis PR allows controlling this behaviour with the existing global config - `migrate.vm.across.clusters`\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

Description\r\nThis fix ensures when datastore cluster in VMware is added as a primary storage pool in CloudStack then all the child datastores (which already exists in CS) should be in Up state.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n1. Datastore Cluster DS has two child datastores A and B in vCenter. (B is already added as a storage pool in CloudStack)\r\n2. Now try to add datastore cluster DS into CloudStack as a primary storage pool\r\n3. CloudStack tries to add child datastores A and B in CloudStack, since B is already there in CloudStack, it will reuse the existing storagepool entry and will keep under parent Storage pool DS.\r\n\r\nDuring Step 3 we are now checking if B is Up state or not.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features,

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #7370 where same foreign key names are used for multiple tables which causes issues with different MySQL versions.\r\n\r\nI've updated the procedure to be more precise and altered the problematic foreign keys in upgrade files. This way we can log the errors and resume the upgrade. \r\n\r\nAlso removed the mysql statements related to foreign key procedure creation and usage from 4.18.0 schema files (those are moved to 4.18.1 java upgrade files) to avoid errors caused in #7370 for certain MySQL versions.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds \r\n\r\n- The support (hypervisor capabilities) for VMware 8.0b (8.0.0.2) and 8.0c (8.0.0.3)\r\n\r\nRefer to

The new guest os mappings introduced in VMware 8.0 (also supported by 8.0a and 8.0b/8.0c)\r\n\r\nRefer to https://vdc-repo.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/c476b64b-c93c-4b21-9d76-be14da0148f9/04ca12ad-59b9-4e1c-8232-fd3d4276e52c/SDK/vsphere-ws/docs/ReferenceGuide/vim.vm.GuestOsDescriptor.GuestOsIdentifier.html\r\n\r\n- An extra step to determine the guest os mappings for a hypervisor version\r\n\r\nSince VMware 8, each minor update has a newer patch version. For example ESXi host of VMware 8.0b has hypervisor version 8.0.0.2. It is different from previous versions, for example, ESXi host of VMware 7.0 update 3a/3b/3c have the same hypervisor version 7.0.3.0 (not 7.0.3.1/7.0.3.2/7.0.3.3).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an extra step to determine the guest os mappings for a hypervisor version: If guest os mapping does not exist, then search for the guest os mapping of parent version. For example\r\n  X if guest os mapping of 8.0.0.2 does not exist, then search for guest os mapping for 8.0\r\n  X if guest os mapping of 8.0.3.2 does not exist, then search for guest os mapping for 8.0.3\r\n\r\nBased on this, we do not need to add guest os mappings for 8.0b (8.0.0.2) and 8.0c (8.0.0.3), the guest os mappings for VMware 8.0 will be used.\r\n\r\nPleae note:\r\nThe hypervisor capabilitiy for VMware 8.0U1 (8.0.1.0) has been added in this PR, but there are some critical failures in the testing on VMware 8.0U1, thus it is not supported.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add the concept of quarantine for public IPs. The feature is fully described in issue #7369. The main goal of this functionality is to block the allocation of a disassociated public IP address by a configurable duration, `public.ip.address.quarantine.duration`. This can prevent the allocation of this recently disassociated IP to another user. More critically, this feature can prevent the allocation of an IP that has been blacklisted for inappropriate use by the previous owner.\r\n\r\nFixes: #7369 \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI added some unit tests to validate the core logic of this feature. Moreover, I tested in a local lab the whole process of disassociation of a public IP address and trying to allocate different accounts with different roles. As designed, only the previous owner was able to allocate the quarantined IP. Furthermore, I tested if the previous behavior is maintained, as the default value for the global configuration `public.ip.address.quarantine.duration` is `0`, no public IP address is added to quarantined, as expected.","created_at":"2023-03-29T12:27:08Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T09:29:23Z","closed_at":"2023-11-15T09:29:22Z","merged_at":"2023-11-15T09:29:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"1f29f6f04096d04a1284a4a8061262b3c3033de3","assignee":{"login":"kiranchavala","id":1401014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDEwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1401014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala","html_url":"https://github.com/kiranchavala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kiranchavala","id":1401014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDEwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1401014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala","html_url":"https://github.com/kiranchavala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"weizhouapache","id":57355700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU1NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57355700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache","html_url":"https://github.com/weizhouapache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073134,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMxMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:management-server","name":"component:management-server","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073351,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vpc","name":"component:vpc","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4"

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue #7357 where VM deployment is failing when storage tags are used in certain way with multiple clusters, though a proper cluster to deploy VM is

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue #7285 \r\nLike the reproduction steps mentioned in the issue, applying VM userdata is failing when VR is in migrating state.\r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\nAt the end of successful or unsuccessful VM migration, hypervisor host name is set on the Virtual Router or config drive.\r\nWhen VR is in wrong state then applying userdata is failing but by then migration is successful and DB is updated.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nupdate hypervisor hostname only if the account.allow.expose.host.hostname and global.allow.expose.host.hostname are set to true and do not mark VM migration as failed as it is already successful. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS,

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue #7325 where root disk is not getting considered for resize in some cases of ScaleVM operation.\r\n\r\nWhile Scaling VM if the compute offering has the root disk size change (for any type of compute offering whether it is normal/constrained/unconstrained) CS should do the resize operation.\r\n\r\nWe already have a check here (https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/2149e82856f4f658dcec5200430a2ac175b07c91/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/vm/UserVmManagerImpl.java#L2102-L2108) whether to skip the disk offering change or not. So here in this PR I've removed the checks if the compute offering is customized or not which I think irrelavant for root disk resize.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR implements Jetty's hot certificate reload per https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/5042\r\n\r\nWhen the keystore changes, the API server begins using the new certificate. Note that this functionality doesn't support live change of keystore password, only certificate.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested locally with self-signed certs.  Changed the cert in the keystore while management server was running, reloaded the website, and inspected the https certificate.\r\n\r\nTested against `cmk`, which continued to function after the cert change.  Also tested against UI - website needed to be refreshed due to browser security. Perhaps a future enhancement would catch these errors and auto-refresh?\r\n\r\nHere you can see the local cloudstack management server using a new cert after it is loaded into a keystore:\r\n```\r\n[root@kvmlab1 management]# echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect localhost:8443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -inform pem -noout -text | grep \"Not Before\"\r\n            Not

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new button that allows the user to copy the VM console URL to the clipboard. VM consoles have a security mechanism that allows for a one-time use per URL (see #6577). Therefore, if the same URL is accessed again, an error message is displayed. When access to the console is requested via the UI button, a new tab is opened which automatically connects to the VM console.  However, for the purpose of obtaining only the URL for later use or sharing, it is more convenient to copy the URL rather than opening it directly in a new tab. The new button appears alongside the existing button that opens the console in a new tab\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48932878/226007219-38238f7f-68bf-43fc-a633-8e3432e26217.png)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI conducted manual testing in a local lab environment. During the testing process, I clicked the new added button and then accessed the copied URL. This allowed me to access the console in the same way as the existing \"View Console\"

different sections of the UI to refer to the Instance. In order to establish consistency, I modified the references to exclusively use \"Instance\".

Description\r\n\r\nWe have discovered that when securitygroups firewall rules are created, they use the MAC address from VM's private_mac_address field. However, if a VM has multiple NICs, then the same MAC address is issued to securitygroup.py which in some cases caused a trouble for the firewall rules.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes Cloudstack use the NIC's MAC address instead of VM's private MAC address.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS,

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #5678 \r\n\r\nNormally SSVMs in multiple zones communicate via the public IPs.\r\nIn some cases, the public IPs are in the internal allowed sites. There are some routes in SSVMs which causes the communication to use the private IPs. We need to add the private IP of other SSVM to /var/www/html/copy/.htaccess if the public IP is in secstorage.allowed.internal.sites\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the console access for Vmware 6.7 which offers SecurityType = 1 (None) - Reference: https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto/blob/master/rfbproto.rst#721none\r\n\r\nThe CPVM access uses the RFB protocol 3.8 since #7015 (previously it used version 3.3). From the link above:\r\n````\r\nVersion 3.8 onwards\r\nThe protocol continues with the SecurityResult message.\r\nVersion 3.3 and 3.7\r\nThe protocol passes to the initialisation phase ([Initialisation Messages](https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto/blob/master/rfbproto.rst#initialisation-messages)).\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the behavior of the security type None, continuing with the SecurityResult message instead of the Initialisation Phase as it was on version 3.3\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the virtual router resources are not counted\r\ntowards domain resource count. Only the CPU/MEM of user\r\nvirtual machine are counted. If some customers have\r\nVR's with higher cpu/memory values than the default value of\r\n1 core, 256MB RAM then they are consuming extra resources\r\nwhich are not counted towards the resource calculation\r\nof the domain/account.\r\n\r\nSo two global settings are added to this change\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"resource.count.running.routers\" and \"resource.count.running.routers.type\"\r\n\r\n\"resource.count.running.routers\" can have either true of false\r\n\"resource.count.running.routers.type\" can have either \"all\" or \"delta\"\r\nThe default value is \"all\"\r\n\r\nIf \"resource.count.running.routers\" is true, then if\r\n\"resource.count.running.routers.type\" is \"all\", then all VR resources\r\nare counted towards the domain resource consumption\r\n\r\nFor example: If VR is running with 4 cores, and 4GB ram, then all 4 cores\r\nand 4 GB are added to domain resource consumption\r\n\r\nIf \"resource.count.running.routers.type\" is \"delta\" then the diff\r\nbetween the current VR CPU/ram and the default VR offering CPU/ram\r\nis considered for domain resource calculation.\r\n\r\nFor example: If VR is running with 4 cores and 4Gb ram, then\r\n3 cores and 4gb-0.25Gb will be counted for resource consumption\r\n\r\nIf \"resource.count.running.routers\" is false, then even if VR\r\nhas higher CPU/ram, then it's not counted towards domain resource\r\nconsumption\r\n\r\nTest cases:\r\n\r\nIt can be tested using.\r\n\r\nnosetests --with-marvin --marvin-config=<your test config file>.cfg test_router_resources.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup that may add test cases)\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-22T01:43:27Z","updated_at":"2025-02-03T14:54:55Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"CharlesQueiroz","id":2192264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTIyNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2192264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlesQueiroz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"CharlesQueiroz","id":2192264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTIyNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2192264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlesQueiroz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlesQueiroz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073351,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vpc","name":"component:vpc","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592315483,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIzMTU0ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:waiting-for-author","name":"status:waiting-for-author","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways in which a SAML response can be formatted, especially when encryption is enabled.  This PR removes the hardcoding of `EncryptedKeyResolver`= `InlineEncryptedKeyResolver` in favor of using a `ChainingEncryptedKeyResolver` which will try multiple resolvers. It preserves the `InlineEncryptedKeyResolver` as the first option but adds `EncryptedElementTypeEncryptedKeyResolver` to the chain of resolvers to try.\r\n\r\n`ChainingEncryptedKeyResolver` is a bit finicky in that you can't provide it a list of resolvers, you can only fetch its internal list and add to it.\r\n\r\nTheoretically we could add all of the resolver types to the chain, but for now just preserving the ones known to be in use.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested locally against an installed IDP that provides the `EncryptedElementType` of XML response.","created_at":"2023-02-21T01:03:20Z","updated_at":"2023-04-03T09:46:04Z","closed_at":"2023-04-03T09:46:03Z","merged_at":"2023-04-03T09:46:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d5fa04c8ba848b57511f07139f968ba253f5167","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":893788912,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4OTM3ODg5MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:saml","name":"component:saml","color":"edef73","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2238703193,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjM4NzAzMTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:needs-testing","name":"status:needs-testing","color":"fc2d98","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/27","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/27","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/27/labels","id":8830986,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AhsAK","number":27,"title":"4.18.1.0","description":"first

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix a feature introduced in PR[#6690](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/6690). It was added the parameter `quotaenabled` to the response of the Quota Summary  API. However, this parameter was not set, and thus, always returned false.
