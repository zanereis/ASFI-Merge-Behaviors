#3607 solved a functional bug in Pooling. Earlier, accumulation and division were happening in the same for loop. This was fine for FP32, but caused problem with Integers where division leads to rounded quotient.

For my test, for EC2 C5 18x.large machine, the runtime goes from 750 us to 60 us.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThere is an additional optimization possible that performs `compute_at` to sink the accumulation inside division. However, that change is much more involved as we have to handle different layouts.

a simple feature to get started with TVM. I was told that this feature is requested. Thanks to zhiics@ for help with figuring everything out. Please add whoever would be appropriate to review.\r\n\r\nThe feature is enabled by passing print_ir=True to build_config. Then the initial IR will be printed, and the IR will be printed after each pass that changes the IR, to avoid IR spam for non-modifying passes. There is a message to say which passes are run and whether the IR changed. Passes that are run due to being pre-requisites of other passes are marked as such. It would be even better to print the IR after each pass to a separate numbered file in a given directory, as in LLVM, but that's for another time.\r\n\r\nSome questions and stuff I noticed:\r\n\r\n1) I detect changes to the IR by recalling the string printed previously. I could also remember/compare modules directly or recall a hash code, but this seemed safest. Let me know if that's the not the right way to do it. It would be nice if passes would report whether they modified the IR, but I didn't find a feature for that.\r\n\r\n2) Both before and after this change, the way pass prerequisites is handled seems broken to me. Suppose pass C depends on pass B which depends on pass A. Then running pass C will cause pass B to be run first, but in this case B will run without running pass A, because prerequisites are not inspected recursively.\r\n\r\n3) Several passes have prerequisites that are not declared in their list of prerequisites, instead ensured by running those passes directly from the pass. Presumably passes are supposed to use the pre-requisite feature to do this, but they don't (perhaps as a work0around for 2 above?). This is done in fold_const.cc in ConstEvaluate(), for one example. This sometimes messes up the feature in this change to explain why a pass was run and it made it more complicated to print the IR before the first pass without doing that again in a nested sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Example usage:\r\n\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport tvm.relay as relay\r\n\r\nshape = (1, 2, 3)\r\nt = relay.TensorType(shape, \"float32\")\r\nx = relay.var(\"x\", t)\r\ntwo = relay.const(2, \"float32\")\r\nfour = relay.add(two, two)\r\nxsum = relay.add(x, four)\r\nfunc = relay.Function([x], xsum)\r\n\r\nseq = relay.transform.Sequential([\r\n    relay.transform.FuseOps(),\r\n])\r\n\r\nwith relay.build_config(opt_level=3,print_ir=True):\r\n    seq(relay.Module({\"main\": func}))\r\n\r\n*** Example output:\r\n\r\n[03:15:32] /home/ubuntu/tvm/src/relay/pass/pass_manager.cc:417: IR before first pass in sequence:\r\nv0.0.4\r\ndef @main(%x: Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32]) {\r\n  %0 = add(2f, 2f);\r\n  add(%x, %0)\r\n}\r\n\r\n[03:15:32] /home/ubuntu/tvm/src/relay/pass/pass_manager.cc:440: IR after InferType (required by FuseOps) changed:\r\nv0.0.4\r\ndef @main(%x: Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32]) -> Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32] {\r\n  %0 = add(2f /* ty=float32 */, 2f /* ty=float32 */) /* ty=float32 */;\r\n  add(%x, %0) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32] */\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n[03:15:32] /home/ubuntu/tvm/src/relay/pass/pass_manager.cc:440: IR after FuseOps changed:\r\nv0.0.4\r\ndef @main(%x: Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32]) -> Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32] {\r\n  %1 = fn (%p0: Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32], Primitive=1) -> Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32] {\r\n    %0 = add(2f /* ty=float32 */, 2f /* ty=float32 */) /* ty=float32 */;\r\n    add(%p0, %0) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32] */\r\n  };\r\n  %1(%x) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 2, 3), float32] */\r\n}\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

PR implements a new target, 'Bifrost', which aims to provide better performance than the existing Mali schedules on Mali GPUs using the more recent Bifrost architecture. In particular, they perform additional data transforms to provide better caching performance and utilise schedules that are more 'quad aware'. I have performed benchmarks of both the new and existing Mali schedules on a Hikey960 board for 4 ImageNet networks and observed the following performance improvements:\r\n \r\n```\r\nNetwork

Dilated convolutions have appeared as an effective alternative to recurrent units in modeling sequences. For example, WaveNet [1] uses a stack of dilated convolutional layers to generate raw audio waveforms from text. Snips [2] modifies the WaveNet architecture to detect a keyword in an audio stream.\r\n\r\nIn order to capture temporal context, the WaveNet architecture feeds a **sliding window** over the input sequence into the first convolutional layer. As noted in [2] and [3], computing convolution over the sliding window results in redundant computation:\r\n![ring_buffer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2532981/66003186-3fcb7a00-e45a-11e9-9161-ec15aa94813c.gif)\r\n\r\nThis pull request implements a **FIFO buffer operator** where intermediate outputs are cached from each convolutional layer, so as to eliminate redundant computation. This is like [4], except that here the re-use is explicit and inherent in the model. Note that caching is only applicable in inference time (so not applicable to training).\r\n![ring_buffer2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2532981/66003842-0b58bd80-e45c-11e9-92d7-2d13cfb23aa6.gif)\r\n\r\n**Semantics**. The FIFO buffer op should behave like\r\n```\r\nconcat(buffer, data, axis=axis)\r\n.slice_axis(axis=axis, begin=data.shape[axis], end=data.shape[axis]+buffer.shape[axis])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Usage**. See `topi/tests/python/test_fifo_buffer.py`\r\n\r\n**Limitation**. Currently, the buffer op exists only in TOPI. To make it useful, we want to merge it into MXNet and other frameworks. Alternatively, we could conceivably implement a custom pass in Relay so that the user can annotate a stack of convolutional layers.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] \"WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw

_declaration_conv_nhwc_pack expects (NHWC, HWOI). Since, TOPI has no way of identifying the kernel layout, this code is triggered for TFLite which has (NHWC, HWIO).\r\n\r\nI tried to investigate if it is a simple fix. However, I am somewhat confused. The test \"topi/tests/python/test_topi_conv2d_nhwc_pack_int8.py\" sets up the conv with HWIO layout instead of HWOI. The failure was not triggered because input_channels = output_channels in the test. When I change the test, it starts failing. Currently, there is no test from the Relay side that exercises the commented code in this PR.\r\n\r\nSo, for now, I disabled the dispatch to that nwhc_pack compute. @llyfacebook Will you be to take a look at this? You can regenerate the error by commenting out the changes in conv2d.py\r\n\r\nWhy I am looking into this? - This causes issue while executing quantized TFLite model on Skylake machine

is a quick fix to solve the crash problem when computing the flop of fused ops.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out by @soiferj, the added flop computation for 3rd party library such as cuBLAS deos not deal with the fusion ops. Although it can be resolved by traversing the graph and add all flops together, I prefer to remove it. The reason is that the flop information is only used by AutoTVM, but AutoTVM has nothing to do with cuBLAS. In addition, traversing the graph may introduce more unnecessary overhead when calling cuBLAS.","created_at":"2019-09-25T16:48:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T20:53:16Z","closed_at":"2019-09-25T20:50:42Z","merged_at":"2019-09-25T20:50:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f19e5a880ea224bbd180a8c163b5d980697a99d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5b8b3373a47a08535df19d8906461492cb6b6295","head":{"label":"comaniac:fix_debse_lib","ref":"fix_debse_lib","sha":"5b8b3373a47a08535df19d8906461492cb6b6295","user":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":202586405,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDI1ODY0MDU=","name":"tvm","full_name":"comaniac/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac/tvm","description":"Open

During this step we first apply scale and zero point to the input data. Then we do rounding and casting to int8.\r\n\r\n`tvm::round` gets lowered by llvm into `roundf` function call which make the op slower. I instead exposed `llvm.nearbyint` via tvm and was able to recover the lost performance.\r\n\r\nSo this PR is just upstreaming that

PR is part of https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/3977\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n\r\n- Removed the operator overload for % and / and explicitly ask developers to use the specific division functions\r\n- Introduce indexdiv and indexmod, a special division function can be redirected to either floordiv/truncdiv. The requirement to use this function is that we know the operands are non-negative, we might introduce additional constraints attachment if necessary as in https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/discuss-embed-more-bound-information-into-var-or-expr/4079\r\n- Refactor the existing code to make use of the division functions \r\n- For now we maintain the old behavior of the code, and we can switch the implementation of indexdiv/mod in a separate PR.","created_at":"2019-09-25T00:32:49Z","updated_at":"2019-09-25T19:47:30Z","closed_at":"2019-09-25T19:47:29Z","merged_at":"2019-09-25T19:47:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"f0079a5713ecb0adee8f82e38b0055438225d345","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c2d906cd4b56e0578a89b14ac7648702511fee66","head":{"label":"tqchen:arithx","ref":"arithx","sha":"c2d906cd4b56e0578a89b14ac7648702511fee66","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/d

#3977 #3479 \r\n\r\nNow that we have multiple integer division modes, it would be helpful to force our developers to be aware of multiple division mode and think about them when writing code. Eventually we might encourage the developers to use one over another. This PR makes all the pattern rewriting of truncdiv/mod explicit by removing the operator/ % overload, and add a clear error message when a developer attempt to declare a pattern using / % operator to

Background\r\nQnn is a dialect to support reading pre-quantized models. It has 2 passes - QnnLegalize and QNNCanonicalizeOps. After these 2 passes, we have a graph that only consists of Relay ops. If the original graph did not have any QNN ops, these two passes will keep the graph unmodified.\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nWe want to have a single API `relay.build` to compile anything that has been parsed using the framework parsers. However, the QNN passes are currently not in the RelayBuild module. This module shows one way how to do that. The idea is that each Dialect can wrap up their passes into one API and the relay.build can call that API internally. \r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n* We can call these two passes between the model parsing and relay.build. But, that does not seem like a good TVM user experience.\r\n* Add these two passes in the framework parsers, as QNN is very much associated with parsers. However, QNNLegalize pass needs target info and we cannot (should not) pass target info in the framework parsers.\r\n\r\nRelevant Discuss post -
