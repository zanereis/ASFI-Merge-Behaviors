What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHere is the generated code snippet when executing date functions. SimpleDateFormat is fairly expensive and can show up bottleneck when processing millions of records. It would be better to instantiate it once.\n\n```\n/* 066 */     UTF8String primitive5 = null;\n/* 067 */     if (!isNull4) {\n/* 068 */       try {\n/* 069 */         primitive5 = UTF8String.fromString(new java.text.SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\").format(\n/* 070 */             new java.util.Date(primitive7 * 1000L)));\n/* 071 */       } catch (java.lang.Throwable e) {\n/* 072 */         isNull4 = true;\n/* 073 */       }\n/* 074 */     }\n```\n\nWith modified code, here is the generated code\n\n```\n/* 010 */   private java.text.SimpleDateFormat sdf2;\n/* 011 */   private UnsafeRow result13;\n/* 012 */   private org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.BufferHolder bufferHolder14;\n/* 013 */   private org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter rowWriter15;\n/* 014 */\n...\n...\n/* 065 */     boolean isNull0 = isNull3;\n/* 066 */     UTF8String primitive1 = null;\n/* 067 */     if (!isNull0) {\n/* 068 */       try {\n/* 069 */         if (sdf2 == null) {\n/* 070 */           sdf2 = new java.text.SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\n/* 071 */         }\n/* 072 */         primitive1 = UTF8String.fromString(sdf2.format(\n/* 073 */             new java.util.Date(primitive4 * 1000L)));\n/* 074 */       } catch (java.lang.Throwable e) {\n/* 075 */         isNull0 = true;\n/* 076 */       }\n/* 077 */     }\n```\n\nSimilarly Calendar.getInstance was used in DateTimeUtils which can be lazily inited.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DateExpressionsSuite,org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.DateTimeUtilsSuite\n","created_at":"2016-06-06T13:01:03Z","updated_at":"2016-06-09T23:39:16Z","closed_at":"2016-06-09T23:39:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"23ee224d6e5435f2efb4d1e0061abb7d118116c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/425aa7ea30f1f92143fc9f539c7b928255dee1c9","head":{"label":"rajeshbalamohan:SPARK-14321-1","ref":"SPARK-14321-1","sha":"425aa7ea30f1f92143fc9f539c7b928255dee1c9","user":{"login":"rajeshbalamohan","id":323339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzMzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan","html_url":"https://github.com/rajeshbalamohan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49923428,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTkyMzQyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rajeshbalamohan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rajeshbalamohan","id":323339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzMzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan","html_url":"https://github.com/rajeshbalamohan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rajeshbalamohan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nInstead of using local variable `sc` like the following example, this PR uses `spark.sparkContext`. This makes examples more concise, and also fixes some misleading, i.e., creating SparkContext from SparkSession.\n\n```\n-    println(\"Creating SparkContext\")\n-    val sc = spark.sparkContext\n-\n     println(\"Writing local file to DFS\")\n     val dfsFilename = dfsDirPath + \"/dfs_read_write_test\"\n-    val fileRDD = sc.parallelize(fileContents)\n+    val fileRDD = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(fileContents)\n```\n\nThis will change 12 files (+30 lines, -52 lines).\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds support for writing in `csv`, `json`, `text` formats in Structured Streaming:\n\n**1. at a high level, this patch forms the following hierarchy**(`text` as an example):\n\n```\n                <OutputWriter>\n                      ↑\n             TextOutputWriterBase\n                 ↗          ↖\nBatchTextOutputWriter   StreamingTextOutputWriter\n```\n\n```\n                    <OutputWriterFactory>\n                        ↗          ↖\nBatchTextOutputWriterFactory   StreamingOutputWriterFactory\n                                              ↑\n                              StreamingTextOutputWriterFactory\n```\n\nThe `StreamingTextOutputWriter` and other 'streaming' output writers would write data **without** using an `OutputCommitter`. This was the same approach taken by [SPARK-14716](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12409).\n\n**2. to support compression, this patch attaches an extension to the path assigned by `FileStreamSink`**, which is slightly different from [SPARK-14716](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12409). For example, if we are writing out using the `gzip` compression and `FileStreamSink` assigns path `${uuid}` to a text writer, then in the end the file written out will be `${uuid}.txt.gz` -- so that when we read the file back, we'll correctly interpret it as `gzip` compressed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`FileStreamSinkSuite` is expanded much more to cover the added `csv`, `json`, `text` formats:\n\n``` scala\ntest(\" csv - unpartitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"json - unpartitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"text - unpartitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\n\ntest(\" csv - partitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"json - partitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"text - partitioned data - codecs: none/gzip\")\n\ntest(\" csv - unpartitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"json - unpartitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"text - unpartitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\n\ntest(\" csv - partitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"json - partitioned writing and batch reading - codecs: none/gzip\")\ntest(\"text - partitioned writing and batch reading - codecs:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, Scala API supports to take options with the types, `String`, `Long`, `Double` and `Boolean` and Python API also supports other types. \n\nThis PR corrects `tableProperty` rule to support other types (string, boolean, double and integer) so that support the options for data sources in a consistent way. This will affect other rules such as DBPROPERTIES and TBLPROPERTIES (allowing other types as values).\n\nAlso, `TODO add bucketing and partitioning.` was removed because it was resolved in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/24bea000476cdd0b43be5160a76bc5b170ef0b42\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrent `metadataLog` in `FileStreamSource` will add a checkpoint file in each batch but do not have the ability to remove/compact, which will lead to large number of small files when running for a long time. So here propose to compact the old logs into one file. This method is quite similar to `FileStreamSinkLog` but simpler.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test added.\n","created_at":"2016-06-05T03:51:07Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T01:37:28Z","closed_at":"2016-09-20T17:26:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81b0e7ea54d67b9146d539b16cb6799cc72798d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84d3d27490556dc1de4e4bce3b6b19a75691f52e","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-15698","ref":"SPARK-15698","sha":"84d3d27490556dc1de4e4bce3b6b19a75691f52e","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n\"test big model load / save\" in Word2VecSuite, lately resulted into OOM.\nTherefore we decided to make the partitioning adaptive (not based on spark default \"spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max\" conf) and then testing it using a small buffer size in order to trigger partitioning without allocating too much memory for the test.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nIt was tested running the following unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently there are some code duplicates in continuous Parquet writes (as in Structured Streaming) and non-continuous writes; see [ParquetFileFormat#prepareWrite()](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/431542765785304edb76a19885fbc5f9b8ae7d64/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetFileFormat.scala#L68) and [ParquetFileFormat#ParquetOutputWriterFactory](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/431542765785304edb76a19885fbc5f9b8ae7d64/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetFileFormat.scala#L414).\n\nThis may lead to inconsistent behavior, when we only change one piece of code but not the other.\n\nBy extracting the common code out, this patch fixes the inconsistency.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHive supports  these cli commands to manage the resource [Hive Doc](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli) : \n`ADD/DELETE (FILE(s)<filepath..>|JAR(s) <jarpath..>)` \n`LIST (FILE(S) [filepath ...] | JAR(S) [jarpath ...])`\n\n but SPARK only supports two commands  \n`ADD (FILE <filepath> | JAR <jarpath>)` \n`LIST (FILE(S) [filepath ...] | JAR(S) [jarpath ...])` for now.\n\nThis PR is to add the DELETE FILE command into Spark SQL and I will submit another PR for the DELETE JAR(s).\n\n`DELETE FILE <filepath>`\n## **Example:**\n\n**DELETE FILE**\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"add file /Users/qianyangyu/myfile.txt\")\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\n\nscala> spark.sql(\"add file

contains a n^2 loop which causes performance issues when operating over large schemas: to determine the ordinal of an attribute reference, we perform a linear scan over the `input` array. Because input can sometimes be a `List`, the call to `input(ordinal).nullable` can also be O(n).\n\nInstead of performing a linear scan, we can convert the input into an array and build a hash map to map from expression ids to ordinals. The greater up-front cost of the map construction is offset by the fact that an expression can contain multiple attribute references, so the cost of the map construction is amortized across a number of lookups.\n\nPerf. benchmarks to follow. /cc

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn case of any bugs in whole-stage codegen, the generated code can't be compiled, we should fallback to non-codegen to make sure that query could run.\n\nThe batch mode of new parquet reader depends on codegen, can't be easily switched to non-batch mode, so we still use codegen for batched scan (for parquet). Because it only support primitive types and the number of columns is less than spark.sql.codegen.maxFields (100), it should not fail.\n\nThis could be configurable by `spark.sql.codegen.fallback`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual test it with buggy operator, it worked well.\n","created_at":"2016-06-03T18:18:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-11T04:13:57Z","closed_at":"2016-06-11T04:13:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"816a26d35424ba249189b8a7592d75c4b6e19a70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13501/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13501/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13501/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/123b7189157a011dfe0e5b4d54d0caa543c6cca0","head":{"label":"davies:codegen_fallback","ref":"codegen_fallback","sha":"123b7189157a011dfe0e5b4d54d0caa543c6cca0","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nNow Spark SQL can support 'create table src stored as orc/parquet/avro' for orc/parquet/avro table. But Hive can support  both commands: ' stored as orc/parquet/avro' and 'stored as orcfile/parquetfile/avrofile'. \nSo this PR supports these keywords 'orcfile/parquetfile/avrofile' in Spark SQL.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nChange FPGrowth from private to private[spark]. If no numPartitions is specified, then default value -1 is used. But -1 is only valid in the construction function of FPGrowth, but not in setNumPartitions. So I make this change and use the constructor directly rather than using set method.  \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test is added\n","created_at":"2016-06-03T06:35:28Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T22:00:21Z","closed_at":"2018-05-07T21:53:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"449883ae2a7535ef8ce6a1578308f48e289e89e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13493/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13493/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13493/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fbbcd263c32a008873c7f080e5abadf1c01fa006","head":{"label":"zjffdu:SPARK-15750","ref":"SPARK-15750","sha":"fbbcd263c32a008873c7f080e5abadf1c01fa006","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39936462,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTkzNjQ2Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zjffdu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu/spark","description":"Mirror

INTO/OVERWRITE statement \ngenerates the same number of columns as its schema.\n```\n\nThe error message is a little confusing. In my simple insert statement, it doesn't have a SELECT clause.\n\nI will change the error message to a more general one\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.RuntimeException:

uses `foldLeft` and list concatenation (`++`) to flatten an iterator of lists, but this is extremely inefficient compared to simply doing `flatMap`/`flatten` because it performs many unnecessary object allocations. Simply replacing this `foldLeft` by a `flatMap` results in decent performance gains when constructing PartitionStatistics instances for tables with many columns.\n\nThis patch fixes this and also makes two similar changes in MLlib and streaming to try to fix all known occurrences of this pattern.\n","created_at":"2016-06-03T05:48:35Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T19:26:02Z","closed_at":"2016-06-05T23:52:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d09a27367a2eb23a5de93b21a516c25e7a7198c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50a62704362d8a0963b47cf4086e594a8f2c2f21","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:foldleft-to-flatmap","ref":"foldleft-to-flatmap","sha":"50a62704362d8a0963b47cf4086e594a8f2c2f21","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen saving datasets on storage, `partitionBy` provides an easy way to construct the directory structure. However, if a user choose all columns as partition columns, some exceptions occurs.\n- **ORC with all column partitioning**: `AnalysisException` on **future read** due to schema inference failure.\n  \n  ``` scala\n  scala> spark.range(10).write.format(\"orc\").mode(\"overwrite\").partitionBy(\"id\").save(\"/tmp/data\")\n  \n  scala> spark.read.format(\"orc\").load(\"/tmp/data\").collect()\n  org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Unable to infer schema for ORC at /tmp/data.

Catalyst's TreeNode transform methods we end up calling `productIterator.map(...).toArray` in a number of places, which is slightly inefficient because it needs to allocate an `ArrayBuilder` and grow a temporary array. Since we already know the size of the final output (`productArity`), we can simply allocate an array up-front and use a while loop to consume the iterator and populate the array.\n\nFor most workloads, this performance difference is negligible but it does make a measurable difference in optimizer performance for queries that operate over very wide schemas (such as the benchmark queries in #13456).\n### Perf results (from #13456 benchmarks)\n\n**Before**\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_66-b17 on Mac OS X 10.10.5\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-4960HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz\n\nparsing large

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUpdate `ApplicationMaster` to sleep for at least the minimum allocation interval before calling `allocateResources`. This prevents overloading the `YarnAllocator` that is happening because the thread is triggered when an executor is killed and its connections die. In YARN, this prevents the app from overloading the allocator and becoming unstable.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested that this allows the an app to recover instead of hanging. It is still possible for the YarnAllocator to be overwhelmed by requests, but this prevents the issue for the most common

an RDD partition is cached on disk and the DiskStore file is lost, then reads of that cached partition will fail and the missing partition is supposed to be recomputed by a new task attempt. In the current BlockManager implementation, however, the missing file does not trigger any metadata updates / does not invalidate the cache, so subsequent task attempts will be scheduled on the same executor and the doomed read will be repeatedly retried, leading to repeated task failures and eventually a total job failure.\n\nIn order to fix this problem, the executor with the missing file needs to properly mark the corresponding block as missing so that it stops advertising itself as a cache location for that block.\n\nThis patch fixes this bug and adds an end-to-end regression test (in `FailureSuite`) and a set of unit tests (`in BlockManagerSuite`).\n\nThis is a branch-1.6 backport of #13473.\n","created_at":"2016-06-02T22:21:01Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T00:52:28Z","closed_at":"2016-06-03T00:52:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b2f5ae5808cd1dee48a48cdf3089700e557afe2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8f047202a15a373c92724d99ec2e4ab2d7d30a07","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:handle-missing-cache-files-branch-1.6","ref":"handle-missing-cache-files-branch-1.6","sha":"8f047202a15a373c92724d99ec2e4ab2d7d30a07","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

an RDD partition is cached on disk and the DiskStore file is lost, then reads of that cached partition will fail and the missing partition is supposed to be recomputed by a new task attempt. In the current BlockManager implementation, however, the missing file does not trigger any metadata updates / does not invalidate the cache, so subsequent task attempts will be scheduled on the same executor and the doomed read will be repeatedly retried, leading to repeated task failures and eventually a total job failure.\n\nIn order to fix this problem, the executor with the missing file needs to properly mark the corresponding block as missing so that it stops advertising itself as a cache location for that block.\n\nThis patch fixes this bug and adds an end-to-end regression test (in `FailureSuite`) and a set of unit tests (`in BlockManagerSuite`).\n","created_at":"2016-06-02T21:22:42Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T02:33:14Z","closed_at":"2016-06-03T00:38:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6042ac3ff0440e7a808a36e03e2724b363ff4617","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13473/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13473/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13473/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/80bc4867aae98837da8023a0da6f80114e21ff9e","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:handle-missing-cache-files","ref":"handle-missing-cache-files","sha":"80bc4867aae98837da8023a0da6f80114e21ff9e","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis makes microbenchmarks run for at least 2 seconds by default, to allow some time for jit compilation to kick in.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually with existing microbenchmarks. This change is backwards compatible in that existing microbenchmarks which specified numIters per-case will still run exactly that number of iterations. Microbenchmarks which previously overrode defaultNumIters now override minNumIters.\n\ncc @hvanhovell

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes a number of `com.esotericsoftware.kryo.KryoException: java.lang.NullPointerException` exceptions reported in [SPARK-15604], [SPARK-14752] etc. (while executing sparkSQL queries with the kryo serializer) by explicitly implementing `KryoSerialization` for `LazilyGenerateOrdering`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n##### The root cause:\n\nWhen `DataSource.resolveRelation` is trying to build `ListingFileCatalog` object, `ListLeafFiles` is invoked where a list of `FileStatus` objects are retrieved from the provided path. These FileStatus objects include directories for the partitions (id=0 and id=2 in the jira). However, these directory `FileStatus` objects also try to invoke `getFileBlockLocations` where directory is not allowed for `DistributedFileSystem`, hence the exception happens.\n\nThis PR is to remove the block of code that invokes `getFileBlockLocations` for every FileStatus object of the provided path. Instead, we call `HadoopFsRelation.listLeafFiles` directly because this utility method filters out the directories before calling `getFileBlockLocations` for generating `LocatedFileStatus` objects.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRegtest is run. Manual test:\n\n```\nscala> spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(\"hdfs://bdavm009.svl.ibm.com:8020/user/spark/SPARK-14959_part\").show\n+-----+---+\n| text| id|\n+-----+---+\n|hello|  0|\n|world|  0|\n|hello|  1|\n|there|  1|\n+-----+---+\n\n       spark.read.format(\"orc\").load(\"hdfs://bdavm009.svl.ibm.com:8020/user/spark/SPARK-14959_orc\").show\n+-----+---+\n| text| id|\n+-----+---+\n|hello|  0|\n|world|  0|\n|hello|  1|\n|there|  1|\n+-----+---+\n```\n\nI also tried it with 2 level of partitioning.\nI have not found a way to add test case in the unit test bucket that can test a real hdfs file location. Any suggestions will be appreciated.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nStop using the abbreviated and ambiguous timezone \"EST\" in a test, since it is machine-local default timezone dependent, and fails in different timezones.  Fixed [SPARK-15723](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15723).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNote that to reproduce this problem in any locale/timezone, you can modify the scalatest-maven-plugin argLine to add a timezone:\n\n```\n<argLine>-ea -Xmx3g -XX:MaxPermSize=${MaxPermGen} -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=${CodeCacheSize} -Duser.timezone=\"Australia/Sydney\"</argLine>\n```\n\nand run \n\n```\n$ mvn test -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.status.api.v1.SimpleDateParamSuite -Dtest=none. Equally this will fix it in an effected timezone:\n\n<argLine>-ea -Xmx3g -XX:MaxPermSize=${MaxPermGen} -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=${CodeCacheSize} -Duser.timezone=\"America/New_York\"</argLine>\n```\n\nTo test the fix, apply the above change to `pom.xml` to set test TZ to `Australia/Sydney`, and confirm the test now passes.\n","created_at":"2016-06-02T04:37:33Z","updated_at":"2016-06-05T16:08:46Z","closed_at":"2016-06-05T14:34:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b9e33112220c26cb0f4e8dd5fa3c6ad57dcfc88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49e4f1f499635c9473e4d102b537235c17229f9a","head":{"label":"javabrett:SPARK-15723-SimpleDateParamSuite","ref":"SPARK-15723-SimpleDateParamSuite","sha":"49e4f1f499635c9473e4d102b537235c17229f9a","user":{"login":"javabrett","id":1103477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDM0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1103477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett","html_url":"https://github.com/javabrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60138565,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDEzODU2NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"javabrett/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"javabrett","id":1103477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDM0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1103477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett","html_url":"https://github.com/javabrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javabrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/javabrett/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDatasetBenchmark compares the performances of RDD, DataFrame and Dataset while running the same operations. However, there are two problems that make the comparisons unfair.\n\n1) In backToBackMap test case, only DataFrame implementation executes less work compared to RDD or Dataset implementations. This test case processes Long+String pairs, but the output from the DataFrame implementation does not include String part while RDD or Dataset generates Long+String pairs as output. This difference significantly changes the performance characteristics due to the String manipulation and creation overheads. \n\n2) In back-to-back map and back-to-back filter test cases, `map` or `filter` operation is executed only once regardless of `numChains` parameter for RDD. Hence the execution times for RDD have been largely underestimated.\n\nOf course, these issues do not affect Spark users, but it may confuse Spark developers.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nBy executing the DatasetBenchmark\n","created_at":"2016-06-02T03:11:51Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T08:02:45Z","closed_at":"2016-08-05T08:02:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8dc69c438de17feeabfc76d093290fb854fe33b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1866ae4aab89e29577b27f38315ff26bd3bb636c","head":{"label":"inouehrs:fix_benchmark_fairness","ref":"fix_benchmark_fairness","sha":"1866ae4aab89e29577b27f38315ff26bd3bb636c","user":{"login":"inouehrs","id":6196943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTY5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6196943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs","html_url":"https://github.com/inouehrs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60061969,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDA2MTk2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"inouehrs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"inouehrs","id":6196943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxOTY5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6196943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs","html_url":"https://github.com/inouehrs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inouehrs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/inouehrs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBlacklistIntegrationSuite (introduced by SPARK-10372) is a bit flaky because of some race conditions:\n1. Failed jobs might have non-empty results, because the resultHandler will be invoked for successful tasks (if there are task successes before failures)\n2. taskScheduler.taskIdToTaskSetManager must be protected by a lock on taskScheduler\n\n(1) has failed a handful of jenkins builds recently.  I don't think I've seen (2) in jenkins, but I've run into with some uncommitted tests I'm working on where there are lots more tasks.\n\nWhile I was in there, I also made an unrelated fix to `runningTasks`in the test framework -- there was a pointless `O(n)` operation to remove completed tasks, could be `O(1)`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI modified the o.a.s.scheduler.BlacklistIntegrationSuite to have it run the tests 1k times on my laptop.  It failed 11 times before this change, and none with it.  (Pretty sure all the failures were problem (1), though I didn't check all of them).\n\nAlso the full suite of tests via jenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-06-01T21:57:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T17:22:12Z","closed_at":"2016-06-03T16:52:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45e25a19ae2361519f3f52d3f7dc478614d60de3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/08ab5d5616dbf501bf8d14126a4aa865ba552ba1","head":{"label":"squito:SPARK-15714","ref":"SPARK-15714","sha":"08ab5d5616dbf501bf8d14126a4aa865ba552ba1","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we don't support bucketing for `save` and `insertInto`.\n\nFor `save`, we just write the data out into a directory users specified, and it's not a table, we don't keep its metadata. When we read it back, we have no idea if the data is bucketed or not, so it doesn't make sense to use `save` to write bucketed data, as we can't use the bucket information anyway.\n\nWe can support it in the future, once we have features like bucket discovery, or we save bucket information in the data directory too, so that we don't need to rely on a metastore.\n\nFor `insertInto`, it inserts data into an existing table, so it doesn't make sense to specify bucket information, as we should get the bucket information from the existing table.\n\nThis PR improves the error message for the above 2  cases.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in `BukctedWriteSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-06-01T21:44:10Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T02:55:14Z","closed_at":"2016-06-03T00:41:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e73361ff320905b99d4d085299b973061cb1c6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13452/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13452/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13452/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d79552984cdf2f39c525e18f321119ef258cd6f","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:error-msg","ref":"error-msg","sha":"4d79552984cdf2f39c525e18f321119ef258cd6f","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`IF NOT EXISTS` in `INSERT OVERWRITE` should not support dynamic partitions. If we specify `IF NOT EXISTS`, the inserted statement is not shown in the table. \n\nThis PR is to issue an exception in this case, just like what Hive does. Also issue an exception if users specify `IF NOT EXISTS` if users do not specify any `PARTITION` specification. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases into `PlanParserSuite` and `InsertIntoHiveTableSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-06-01T17:41:20Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T05:55:37Z","closed_at":"2016-06-17T05:55:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"efe5c5c5317c48e282a33f1fa426ec720a4a01ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13447/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13447/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13447/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84ed71ad89f3571f317694fd5803ce341a3b46b8","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:insertIfNotExist","ref":"insertIfNotExist","sha":"84ed71ad89f3571f317694fd5803ce341a3b46b8","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

was running a 15TB join job with 202000 partitions. It looks like the changes I made to CoalesceRDD in pickBin() are really slow with that large of partitions. The array filter with that many elements just takes to long.\nIt took about an hour for it to pickBins for all the partitions.\noriginal change:\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/83ee92f60345f016a390d61a82f1d924f64ddf90\n\nJust reverting the pickBin code back to get currpreflocs fixes the issue\n\nAfter reverting the pickBin code the coalesce takes about 10 seconds so for now it makes sense to revert those changes and we can look at further optimizations later.\n\nTested this via RDDSuite unit test and manually testing the very large job.\n","created_at":"2016-06-01T15:54:53Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T20:23:33Z","closed_at":"2016-06-01T20:23:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf16d1ad4d64dbd2e347001a09b6fee65bbe0548","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13443/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13443/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13443/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f630b64a590bd85e88e02f8896fffd253a43bed5","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-15671","ref":"SPARK-15671","sha":"f630b64a590bd85e88e02f8896fffd253a43bed5","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUsing test statistics as a measure of decision tree split quality is a useful split halting measure that can yield improved model quality. I am proposing to add the chi-squared test statistic as a new impurity option (in addition to \"gini\" and \"entropy\") for classification decision trees and ensembles.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15699\n\nhttp://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2016/05/26/measuring-decision-tree-split-quality-with-test-statistic-p-values/\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI added unit testing to verify that the chi-squared \"impurity\" measure functions as expected when used for decision tree

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUnblock some of the useful repl commands. like, \"implicits\", \"javap\", \"power\", \"type\", \"kind\". As they are useful and fully functional and part of scala/scala project, I see no harm in having them either.\n\nVerbatim paste form JIRA description.\n\"implicits\", \"javap\", \"power\", \"type\", \"kind\" commands in repl are blocked. However, they work fine in all cases I have tried. It is clear we don't support them as they are part of the scala/scala repl project. What is the harm in unblocking them, given they are useful ?\nIn previous versions of spark we disabled these commands because it was difficult to support them without customization and the associated maintenance. Since the code base of scala repl was actually ported and maintained under spark source. Now that is not the situation and one can benefit from these commands in Spark REPL as much as in scala repl.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests and manual, by trying out all of the above commands.\n\nP.S. Symantics of reset are to be discussed in a separate issue.\n","created_at":"2016-06-01T08:41:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T18:15:12Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T18:15:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c57e2bb017f9811d06cab352019e01663097b17a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/13e1e0cec39056aa91c9eec600f8df2594f12c1f","head":{"label":"ScrapCodes:SPARK-15697/repl-unblock-commands","ref":"SPARK-15697/repl-unblock-commands","sha":"13e1e0cec39056aa91c9eec600f8df2594f12c1f","user":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17210717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIxMDcxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ScrapCodes/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `crosstab` returns a Dataframe having **random-order** columns obtained by just `distinct`. Also, the documentation of `crosstab` shows the result in a sorted order which is different from the current implementation. This PR explicitly constructs the columns in a sorted order in order to improve user experience. Also, this implementation gives the same result with the documentation.\n\n**Before**\n\n``` scala\nscala> spark.createDataFrame(Seq((1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR corrects the remaining cases for using old accumulators.\n\nThis does not change some old accumulator usages below:\n- `ImplicitSuite.scala` - Tests dedicated to old accumulator, for implicits with `AccumulatorParam`  \n- `AccumulatorSuite.scala` -  Tests dedicated to old accumulator\n- `JavaSparkContext.scala` - For supporting old accumulators for Java API.\n- `debug.package.scala` - Usage with `HashSet[String]`. Currently, it seems no implementation for this. I might be able to write an anonymous class for this but I didn't because I think it is not worth writing a lot of codes only for this.\n- `SQLMetricsSuite.scala` - This uses the old accumulator for checking type boxing. It seems new accumulator does not require type boxing for this case whereas the old one requires (due to the use of generic).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests cover

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nImproves the explain output of several physical plans by displaying embedded logical plan in tree style\n\nSome physical plan contains a embedded logical plan, for example, `cache tableName query` maps to:\n\n```\ncase class CacheTableCommand(\n    tableName: String,\n    plan: Option[LogicalPlan],\n    isLazy: Boolean) \n  extends RunnableCommand\n```\n\nIt is easier to read the explain output if we can display the `plan` in tree style.\n\n**Before change:**\n\nEverything is messed in one line.\n\n```\nscala> Seq((1,2)).toDF().createOrReplaceTempView(\"testView\")\nscala> spark.sql(\"cache table testView2 select * from testView\").explain()\n== Physical Plan ==\nExecutedCommand CacheTableCommand testView2, Some('Project [*]\n+- 'UnresolvedRelation `testView`, None\n), false\n```\n\n**After change:**\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"cache table testView2 select * from testView\").explain()\n== Physical Plan ==\nExecutedCommand\n:  +- CacheTableCommand testView2, false\n:     :  +- 'Project [*]\n:     :     +- 'UnresolvedRelation `testView`, None\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt removes a sentence about `SparkListener` being internal and may change in the future yet the class is `@DeveloperApi` that may or may not say the

If it does not, it's clearly incorrect. If it says what `@DeveloperApi` is for, it's a duplication (and/or would require other `@DeveloperApi` to have it, too).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdding a \"(runtime)\" to the dependency configuration will set a fallback configuration to be used if the requested one is not found.  E.g. with the setting \"default(runtime)\", Ivy will look for the conf \"default\" in the module ivy file and if not found will look for the conf \"runtime\".  This can help with the case when using \"sbt publishLocal\" which does not write a \"default\" conf in the published ivy.xml file.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nused spark-submit with --packages option for a package published locally with no default conf, and a package resolved from Maven central.\n","created_at":"2016-06-01T00:34:21Z","updated_at":"2017-01-03T22:28:46Z","closed_at":"2016-08-20T20:47:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"760e12081f184fe62c54b90d054229803ee7de26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13428/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13428/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13428/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df1ac92b6ae73eaf05b4f4b3d9a4a9178d724f05","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:fallback-package-conf-SPARK-12666","ref":"fallback-package-conf-SPARK-12666","sha":"df1ac92b6ae73eaf05b4f4b3d9a4a9178d724f05","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror
