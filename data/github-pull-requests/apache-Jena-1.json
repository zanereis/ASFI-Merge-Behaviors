OSGi declarations in the Gson jar now specify that <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code>  is an optional dependency, not a required one. If you do not use OSGi then there is no effective change.</p>\n<h2>Gson 2.12.0</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<p>The biggest change is that we no longer support Java 7. People who still need to run on Java 7 will need to use an earlier version of Gson.</p>\n<p>Other changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow registering adapters for <code>JsonElement</code> again by <a

It seems that so far there were no reliable util methods to create a single valid NQ string - unless one goes through riot. None of the formatting methods in `NodeFmtLib` and `FmtUtils` seem to produce NQ.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development

issue resolved #2924\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\n* Added a new test case with nested laterals.\r\n* Fixed nested laterals by merging compatible bindings in `QueryIterLateral`\r\n* While writing the tests, I added a few shorthands to the QueryExecBuilder API: Its now possible to write `QueryExec.dataset(...).query(\"SELECT ...\").table()` to generally safely obtain a detached materialized in-memory table without having to worry about resource leaks or try-with-resources blocks. In the revised tests, the tables are used directly when asserting the equality of expected and actual results. In an attempt to allow for cleanly detaching BindingTDB instances, I added `Binding.detach()` with appropriate implementations. `Binding.detach` avoids copying of bindings that are already in-memory, and is thus more subtle than `BindingFactory.copy`.\r\n* Added a `TableBuilder` class to build immutable tables.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to

issue resolved #2828 \r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nThis completes #2828, removing the vast majority of unused and unnecessary code in the ext.xerces namespace. Jena still compiles after this, and tests seem to be passing.\r\n\r\n- In general, I went through the code iteratively, locating unreachable code branches and unused fields/methods/classes. I repeated this until there was nothing left to remove.\r\n- The `ValidationState` class that I initially had my main issue with turned out to be completely unnecessary. As far as I understand, its only use was to store some state as the validator goes through the XML document. Because here we are always validating one literal (and not a document), this was not needed at all.\r\n- After #2833, the only use of the `pattern` facet (for regex checks) was for `xsd:language`, where the pattern is very, very simple (`([a-zA-Z]{1,8})(-[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,8})*`). I have therefore removed the xerces regex implementation from core entirely and instead the code now uses Java `Pattern`. I'm 99.9% sure it will be fine. I've also added some tests to check this.\r\n- Several other validation facets turned out to be unused in the code (for example: everything related to length). I have removed these.\r\n- Many classes were used only for validation of custom XSD types, and therefore they were removed.\r\n- The size of the `jena-core` JAR was reduced by ~165 KB (from 2_016_067 to 1_846_347 bytes).\r\n- Datatype validation in Jena should be somewhat sped up by this, just because less objects are allocated and passed through the call stack. The leaner code size may also help with instruction caching on the CPU. I didn't do any benchmarks, though... I will check this and come back later with some numbers.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Documentation change and updates are provided for the [Apache Jena website](https://github.com/apache/jena-site/)\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key commit messages start with the issue number

We will not remove the constants, but we recommend using <code>StandardCharsets</code> for consistency. (45e6be2688)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added <code>ToStringHelper.omitEmptyValues()</code>. (f5ec2ab85c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added an optimized <code>copyOf</code> method to <code>TreeRangeMap</code>. (a46565dd1c)</li>\n<li><code>collect.testing</code>: Fixed <code>@Require</code> annotations so that features implied by absent features are not also required to be absent. (81be061f85)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Changed <code>ByteSink</code> and <code>CharSink</code> to no longer call <code>flush()</code> in some cases before <code>close()</code>. This is a no-op for well-behaved streams, which internally flush their data as part of closing. However, we have discovered some stream implementations that have overridden <code>close()</code> to do nothing, including not to flush some buffered data. If this change causes problems, the simplest fix is usually to change the <code>close()</code> override to at least call <code>flush()</code>. (6ace8bc8ea)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders.ALT_SVC</code> and <code>MediaType.CBOR</code>.

PR is preparation for the first step #2775 -- replacing the `fuseki-server.jar` artifact with one based on FusekiMain, not Fuseki/Webapp, making no changes to functionality.\r\n\r\nThe PR is accumulated clear-up and reshuffling without making the changes so that the internal improvements are not sync'ed to the changes making a `fuseki-server.jar` and are available to Fuseki/Webapp.\r\n\r\nThe PR includes the reload code for #2462 but this PR does not expose the functionality. The reload ability will be part of the switch to a non-webapp Fuseki server jar with UI and admin controls.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included but not for #2462 (coming later)\r\n - [ ] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key commit messages start with the issue number (GH-xxxx)\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I acknowledge

issue resolved #2883 \r\n\r\nPull request Description: Changed a line to pass on an ExprTransform rather than null.\r\n\r\nNotes for possible further improvements outside the scope of this PR:\r\n* It may be the case that `ElementTransformer` needs to create an identity ExprTransform rather than passing null into the machinery.\r\n* `QueryTransformOps.transformVarExprList` in my IDE warns that the `changed` flag is not used. Perhaps this needlessly creates clones of queries w.r.t. identity transforms.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development
