PR refactors the sparse tensor code based upon the comments here. https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/5800\r\n\r\n1. In the imperative mode, returns stypes of output ndarrays together with their handles to the front end to avoid the c-api for the stypes of those handles when constructing python NDArrays. \r\n\r\n2. Saves stype attribute in the python NDArray class to avoid c-api calls to the backend for retrieving the stype from an NDArray handle.\r\n\r\n3. Created a folder named `ndarray` under `src/python/mxnet` as a subpackage for `ndarray.py`, `sparse_ndarray.py`, `ndarray_utils.py`, `op.py`, and `_internal.py`. The folder acts as the namespace `mxnet.ndarray` for all ndarray related functions.\r\n\r\n4.

@mli @szha This implementation provides some degree of parallelism on the GPU. The version it replaces would do 1 kernel launch per DType instance (int, float) to be copied, which would make perf really bad on the GPU (kernel launch latency and no parallelism). In Sockeye, this would take up 20% of the timeline. With this change, the time consumed went down to less than 0.5%. I also added tests, since this operator didn't have either CPU or GPU

of optimized GPU kernels for `dot(csr,dns)=dns` and `dot(csr.T,dns)=dns`. Different kernel versions are included for both cases which can be switched depending on the input attributes for best performance - for example, the `dot(csr,dns)` vector kernel performs better than the scalar kernel in most cases for SpMV or when dense matrix is tall and skinny (see e.g. [SpMV paper](http://wnbell.com/media/2008-12-NVR-SpMV/nvr-2008-004.pdf) for more details and terminology). The old kernels are so-called scalar kernels (1); the new kernels are numbered (2)-(4).\r\nBenchmark results for SpMV and SpMM and the transpose case with uniformly distributed non-zeros in the CSR matrix are shown below for Kernels (1) and (2) of each case. Benchmark conducted on K-80 (p2.xlarge) with compile flags `USE_OPENCV=1 USE_BLAS=openblas USE_CUDA=1 USE_CUDNN=1`.\r\nHighlights (for this particular benchmark):\r\n- Performance of SpMV/SpMM [dot(csr,dns)] improved by up to ~40.\r\n- Performance of SpMV/SpMM tranpose [dot(csr.T,dns)] improved by up to ~500.\r\n\r\n@piiswrong @madjam @reminisce @eric-haibin-lin

to this change you could do the easy mistake of accidentally\r\npassing in a ndarray as the second argument of mx.nd.save, instead of\r\na dict or list. This would lead to a segmentation fault. Here's the\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nd = mx.nd.zeros((12,12))\r\nmx.nd.save(\"test\", d)\r\n```\r\nThe correct usage of mx.nd.save would have been\r\n```\r\nmx.nd.save(\"test\", [d])\r\n```\r\nThe reason why this crashes is very subtle. It involves the following\r\ncode from mx.nd.save:\r\n```\r\nfor val in data:\r\n   if not isinstance(val, NDArray):\r\n       raise TypeError('save only accept dict str->NDArray or list of NDArray')\r\n   handles.append(val.handle)\r\n```\r\nBasically if `data` is a ndarray we can still iterate over it. This\r\nmeans we iterate over the individual rows. `val` will be a temporary\r\nndarray python object holding a reference to a new NDarray C++ object\r\nin handle. The problem is that we keep a reference to `val.handle`\r\nright before val and therefore also val.handle will be gargabe

commit adds profiling to push and pull of local kvstore. It reuses the profilng infrastructure of engine.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this profiling is understanding how workers are consuming time in the communication. If they are spending too much time in the paths, optimizing it with RDMA based transport would be hopeful.\r\n\r\nI'm starting it with local kvs because I'm very new to mxnet so reusing the proriler of the engine is correct or not. If someone can review this strategy, I'm very glad.","created_at":"2017-06-29T07:47:33Z","updated_at":"2017-06-30T08:03:32Z","closed_at":"2017-06-30T08:03:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f59df10d04b5b73853dd979e3bd9c9ece1718cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6866/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6866/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6866/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b1aa989327b50ca19912ed805ddcc44ec107109f","head":{"label":"mitake:kvstore-profile","ref":"kvstore-profile","sha":"b1aa989327b50ca19912ed805ddcc44ec107109f","user":{"login":"mitake","id":1173955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzM5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1173955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake","html_url":"https://github.com/mitake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94747605,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDc0NzYwNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"mitake/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mitake","id":1173955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzM5NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1173955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake","html_url":"https://github.com/mitake","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitake/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mitake/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

motivated by the benchmark results of [cast_storage](https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet/pull/109#issuecomment-310571404).\r\n1. Enabled `dot(csr.T, dns)` to output an rsp format matrix. This avoids the step of casting a dense matrix to a rowsparse one after `dot(csr.T, dns)=dns` is performed. We identified that casting operation is a bottleneck in the network.\r\n2. Used `STORAGE_TYPE_ASSIGN_CHECK` in storage type inference for sparse dot.\r\n3. Added fallback function for sparse dot forward and backward.\r\n4. Fixed a unittest typo.\r\n\r\n@piiswrong @eric-haibin-lin

caffe-to-mxnet converter and improved converter test\r\n\r\n- Added support for networks which uses batch normalization without a scale layer following the batch norm, i.e. gamma is fixed to 1\r\n- Extended naming convention used when implementing batch normalization in caffe\r\n- Added support for old caffe versions where dilation didn't exist. This is needed to convert models which depends on old caffe\r\n- Added support for deconvolution layer\r\n- Added support for older version of caffe where kernel_size, pad and stride parameters were not iterable\r\n- Fixed crash happening when a bottom layer doesn't exist in the internal top_to_layers dictionary, this can happen if the name of the input is not 'data'\r\n- Added ignore-by-design support for converting 'Crop' layers\r\n- Fixed batch norm layer comparison to take into account the rescaling factor\r\n- Added careful condition in tester to swap (RGB,BGR) input channels only if they are of size 3 or 4, which is the same check the conversion does\r\n- Allow comparing layers of models with no mean file\r\n- Added support for comparing the parameters of deconvolution
