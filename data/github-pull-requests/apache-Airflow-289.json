JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

Production, Staging, etc.), so we cannot distinguish which Airflow is. This feature enables us to discern the Airflow by the color of navigation bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis is only UI change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1950\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nChanges the `task_ids` parameter of xcom_pull from required to optional.\r\n\r\nThe task_ids parameter has always allowed `None`, but since it's been a required parameter, we've been forced to pass it.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nti.xcom_pull(task_ids=None, key='foo')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this patch, we're no longer forced to pass task_ids. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nti.xcom_pull(key='foo')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdds `tests.models.TaskInstanceTest.test_xcom_pull`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1949\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPreviously the varimport request handler was using str to coerce the buffer:\r\n\r\n    out = str(request.files['file'].read())\r\n\r\nThis was producing:\r\n\r\n    b'{...\r\n\r\nWhich is not valid JSON. Producing an Exception. Unfortunately the exception message is also not printed (flashed) so it's hard to discern what is going wrong.\r\n\r\nI've added the exception to the flash message and removed the use of str. This works for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNot sure how to add value with a unit test to this handler? Could use some guidance.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-22T05:24:47Z","updated_at":"2019-05-03T10:04:42Z","closed_at":"2018-01-11T19:36:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"188c18150848b95ed2866228e026b32ee99a99ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2899/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2899/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2899/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4218adc576dbd5a24e810bb91cf071cac2b27013","head":{"label":"j16r:bugfix/AIRFLOW-1949_config_upload","ref":"bugfix/AIRFLOW-1949_config_upload","sha":"4218adc576dbd5a24e810bb91cf071cac2b27013","user":{"login":"j16r","id":344071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDA3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/344071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r","html_url":"https://github.com/j16r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j16r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b75367bb572e8bbfc1bfd539fbb34a76a5ed484d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1937\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nNewly scheduled task instances (state = None, up for retry)\r\nwere committed per task instance instead of all at once.\r\nThis isn't required as tasks cannot be picked up by another\r\nprocess in the mean time. Committing in batch significantly\r\nspeeds up task scheduling for dags that have a lot of tasks.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nCovered by existing.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-18T12:41:54Z","updated_at":"2017-12-23T08:42:32Z","closed_at":"2017-12-23T08:42:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e8e2dfcb6eaba91ba56fc474e44b6434de40867","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2888/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2888/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2888/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/2eb6c79153bf819c5ca25960fa619c9d62e9e4d4","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:AIRFLOW-1937","ref":"AIRFLOW-1937","sha":"2eb6c79153bf819c5ca25960fa619c9d62e9e4d4","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow

JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1932) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdds the necessary hooks to support pulling and acknowleding Pub/Sub messages. This is implemented by adding a PubSubPullSensor operator that will attempt to retrieve messages from a specified subscription and will meet its criteria when a message or messages is available. The configuration allows those messages to be acknowledged immediately. In addition, the messages are passed to downstream workers via the return value of operator's execute method. \r\n\r\nAn end-to-end example is included showing topic and subscription creation, parallel tasks to publish and pull messages, and a downstream chain to echo the contents of each message before cleaning up.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n - `tests.contrib.sensors.test_pubsub_sensor.py`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1916\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] In a previous change we removed special config for airflow.task.raw handler (which\r\nprinted to stdout directly) and replaced it with one that wrote to the\r\nlog file itself. The problem comes that python automatically calls\r\n`logging.shutdown()` itself on process clean exit. This ended up\r\nuploading the log file twice: once from the end of `airflow run --raw`,\r\nand then again from the explicit shutdown() call at the end of cli's\r\n`run()`\r\n\r\n  Since logging is automatically shutdown this change adds and explicit\r\nflag to control if the GC and S3 handlers should upload the file or not,\r\nand we tell them not to when running with `--raw`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: expanded on tests to S3 and Base log handlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

this PR I want to initiate the discussion on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1623.\r\n\r\nSome context on the expected behavior of Airflow:\r\n* Submit Spark job to cluster\r\n* Clear Airflow job from UI\r\n* The Spark job on the cluster is also clear by the on_kill function in the hook\r\n\r\nThe last part of this behavior is currently not happening due to the bug described in the issue. As mentioned in the issue description, the line of code I added with the PR, does not solve the issue as the reference to the task is lost.\r\n\r\nNot sure who can help with this issue as this touches a lot of core parts of Airflow and for me they are all not that clear.\r\n\r\nOne solution I can think of is instead of using the task reference, create a kill cli command using the task_id.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1623) issue\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1904\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently dag file location `dag.fileloc` is determined by getting the second stack frame from the top, i.e. self.fileloc = sys._getframe().f_back.f_code.co_filename\r\nHowever this fails if the DAG is constructed from an imported module. For example, if I import a DagBuilder in my dagfile, the dagbuilder's filepath would ended up becoming the fileloc, rather than the dag itself.\r\nThis causes a bug whenever the DAG is refreshed, because it tries to reload from the fileloc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested locally via UI to ensure that refresh works with the corrected fileloc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

the current state, the spark submit operator does not support standalone cluster mode.\r\nWhen using such a cluster, it leads to Airflow starting too many Spark jobs in parallel as it is mistakenly interprets the spark-submit.sh returncode 0 as a [SUCCESS].\r\nThis PR adds a status check to keep track of the Spark driver status on the standalone cluster.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1854) issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] When executing a Spark submit to a standalone cluster using the Spark submit hook, it will get a return code from the Spark submit shell and not the Spark job itself.\r\nThis means when a Spark submit is executed and successfully received by the cluster, the Airflow job will automatically consider it to be successful, even when the Spark job is not yet finished or failed.\r\n\r\nWhen your Airflow connection is set to work with a standalone cluster mode, this sumbitted version of the hook will start tracking the driver status. It parses the logs after spark submit is done and retrieves the driver id and polls the driver status every second.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests in `/tests/contrib/hooks/test_spark_submit_hook.py`:\r\n    - Shell commands created to discover the driver status\r\n    - Correct parsing of the spark logs to retrieve the driver id and\r\n    the driver status\r\n    - Correct parsing of the connection string\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following issues\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1886\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n    - Currently, AirFlow is not honoring the max_active_runs_per_dag in airflow.cfg when a DAG aborts. The current setup will keep submitting next scheduled DAG not counting any failed incomplete DAGs that are already in the queue. Added failed_runs to jobs.py in order to count aborted DAGs also.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - There are no unit tests but I have been running this fix in production for almost 6

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1884\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR\r\n\r\nThis came out of the mailing list discussion about crash safety of the scheduler and resetting orphaned tasks. From digging in more, I found that we only reset orphaned task state for dagruns that are both not externally triggered and not backfilled. This violates the crash safety property of the scheduler, ie) if the scheduler crashes in the middle of one of these dagruns then tasks will be \"Queued\" forever and never executed. \r\n\r\nI found the changeset this regression happened in, it is this one:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1059\r\n\r\nBefore this changeset, there was no special casing of the backfilled/externally triggered dags and then after this changeset there is. I don't think this change was intended, as it adversely affects the crash safety of the scheduler. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo new unit tests, but modifies the existing unit tests around resetting orphaned tasks to reflect the fact that backfilled dagruns and externally triggered dagruns now are crash safe. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1873\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n  This is hard to test right now, but the problem was that the initial `airflow run ...` command from the executor would open a file, then increment the try_number of the TaskInstance in the database. It would then run `airflow run --raw ...` which would then add 1 to it again\r\nbefore opening the log file, meaning that logs/prints from inside operators ended up in the \"next\" file (which would never show up in the webserver UI.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] I've added _some_ tests to FileTaskHandler but I'm not sure I'm really testing the right thing here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-342\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\namqp and rpc (and redis most likely) cannot store results for tasks\r\nlong enough. This shows a warning when those result backend have been configured.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1869\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nKeep exception strings in the gcs logs for tasks\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: This is primarily changing logging information and adds no new code paths.  Current testing should be sufficient\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1117\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n    - min_file_process_interval=0 causes the scheduler to rapidly loop over DAGs and consume inordinate processor time. Setting the default to 6 seconds slows the looping and avoids aligning with heartbeats. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n     - This config change should not affect test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-30T00:04:17Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T20:51:48Z","closed_at":"2019-04-17T20:51:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8ca02595f386d60a1c6555b17a4180031df4c0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c3d009adc339ba687fb13c1022aa303c921359d6","head":{"label":"mhousley:scheduler_default_issue","ref":"scheduler_default_issue","sha":"c3d009adc339ba687fb13c1022aa303c921359d6","user":{"login":"mhousley","id":18333738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzMzNzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18333738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley","html_url":"https://github.com/mhousley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108578929,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg1Nzg5Mjk=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"mhousley/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mhousley","id":18333738,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzMzNzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18333738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley","html_url":"https://github.com/mhousley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhousley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mhousley/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1559\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1665\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n\r\nAn overloaded or faulty database can easily take down Airflow. This PR addresses two dimensions of this problem: Airflow must be more diligent in gracefully closing unused connections, and it must reconnect if one of its existing connection fails unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nFor reviewers, I would suggest to read this PR commit by commit rather than whole diff at once. Each commit also comes with a more lengthy description of its intend.\r\n\r\nThe PR is partially based on #2767  by @vklogin and #2744 by @dhuang with a few improvements and clean-ups on top.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThe database layer is used throughout the entire code base, so this improvement leverages the existing test coverage. The newly added behaviour depends on the interlinked behaviour of the main thread, sub- and child processes, and the database.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1688] Automatically add load.time_partitioning to bigquery_hook when table name includes $\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1688\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe gcs_to_bq operator throws and exception when trying to auto-create a new date partitioned table. \r\nTo allow the table creation the load configuration needs the api option:\r\nload.timePartitioning:\r\n{type: 'DAY'}\r\nI will add a fix to identify date partitioned table from the presence of a $ in the table name and add the option.\r\nI have also added \"time_partitioning\" option to the load, which is a dictionary that mirrors the 'timePartitioning' config in google's api. Using the time partitioning option we can add on top of partition type also a specific field to partition by and the partition expiration time as per example below:\r\n\r\n{'type': 'DAY', 'field': 'test_field', 'expirationMs': 1000}\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\nadded unitest case TestTimePartitioningInRunJob in tests.contrib.hooks.test_bigquery_hook to verify that the normal job execution won't fail because of the changes, '$' in the table name adds automatically the partition configuration to the load, the extra time partitioning options are returned as expected, field based partitioning and specific partition name can't be specified at the same time\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1855\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    1. Added 'delimiter' argument in GCS hook to filter files with a particular delimiter.\r\n    2. Added a GCS operator that copies objects (optionally from a directory) filtered by 'delimiter' (file extension for e.g .json or .csv) from a bucket to another bucket in a different directory, if required.\r\n    The feature in Airflow currently to Copy GCS objects is `GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageOperator` in `gcs_to_gcs.py` that can only copy a single object and cannot filter files based on delimiter or extension. Most users would want to copy multiple files with some extension to a different directory (possibly in different bucket).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nGoogle doesn't provide local unittest for GCS.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-28T10:52:39Z","updated_at":"2017-12-01T23:52:50Z","closed_at":"2017-12-01T23:52:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"77c928eefc36c1e2ae60ed94af20a4cd40b20401","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2819/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2819/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2819/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6b2294a2c9ce48af86950ad49d206b4e646c0faa","head":{"label":"kaxil:master","ref":"master","sha":"6b2294a2c9ce48af86950ad49d206b4e646c0faa","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache
