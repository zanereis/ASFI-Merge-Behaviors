Folks,\nThis pull request formalizes the contribution from Adnane B. over on [NUTCH-2222](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-2222). I am not sure that this is catching the bug however and it seems like the bug only rears it's head when we use a persistent datastore. \nRight now this patch uses the MemStore implementation which is what we agreed tests would be like. I think we need to do add to the tests in order to have a persistent datastore setup and that data is persisted into the datastore.

against master branch\n- making the IndexerMapReduceMapper and IndexerMapReduceReducer in IndexerMapReduce code explicit so that these functions can be tested\n- adding in some mrunit tests for testing the IndexerMapReduceMapper and IndexerMapReduceReducer\n- removing some trivial imports which are unsed\n- formatting ivy.xml which has somehow (again) become a dogs dinner\n- adding default constructor to NutchIndexAction()\n\nAny questions, then please let me know. I would really appreciate if people could pull this code and try it out within your test or local environment.\nThanks, also thanks Markus for the original suggestions for tests,

adds the possibility of exporting the nutch segments to a WARC files. \n\nFrom the usage point of view a couple of new command line options are available: \n- `-warc`: enables the functionality to export into WARC files, if not specified the default JACKSON formatter is used.\n- `-warcSize`: enable the option to define a max file size for each WARC file, if not specified a default of 1GB per file is used as recommended by the WARC ISO standard.\n\nThe usual `-gzip` flag can be used to enable compression on the WARC files, which allow to compress the output files. \n\nSome changes to the

some time, I have been using @momer's Selenium plugin for Nutch 2.3, which has worked wonders in AJAX crawling. Lately however, I've noticed the following issues with it:\n1. It does not support HTTPS. While adding support for HTTPS into it, I realized that:\n2. It does a lot of non-Selenium stuff that makes it inefficient, including making every request twice.\n\nI've cleaned up the code(unfortunately, the update history pointing to him is gone because of the lazy copy), making sure it uses Selenium and only selenium.\n\nSo far it has the following weaknesses:\n- Selenium's Wait does not appear to be properly used(also an issue in @momer's code)\n- It does not fill out the WebPage fields according to snuff. I do think someone more experienced with Selenium could get this done, or I might add support in the future.\n- Does not fetch robots.txt properly.\n\nDue to these issues, I think merging is a bit premature. However, I'd like to point out that I do not think @momer's code should be merged
