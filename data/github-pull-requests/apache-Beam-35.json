robust fusion heuristics to Prism's graph Pre-processing, leading to improved performance when it's enabled. In this PR it's enabled by default, but in a subsequent PR, it'll be enabled by default in the stand alone command, and generally all variants except the \"test\" variant.\r\n\r\n* Largely cribbed from Python fn_api_runner/translations.py, which is based on two main heuristics: Avoiding side input conflicts, and indicating situations where a producing transform must not be fused with a consuming transform.\r\n* Updated handlers and fact computation to use return structs.\r\n* Add simple benchmarks for the Go Direct Runner, and Prism to demonstrate fusion was effective.\r\n* Clean up no-longer necessary exec side override for environments (handled in handlers now).\r\n* Fix Bug in ProcessBundle handling where a stage without data outputs would not send progress or split requests. This broke the channel splitting test in particular.\r\n  * As a bonus, this moves that async processing into the progress handling loop, cleaning up that handling. \r\n\r\nMinor fixes:\r\n* Fix Transform UniqueName for Combine extract output.\r\n* Fix channel splitting separation harness test to have an explicit Reshuffle, as it can't be automatically added for that synthetic test.\r\n  * Reduce wait time for separation harness polling.\r\n\r\nNote: This can be improved if we add \"Flatten Unnzipping/Sinking\" where Flattens can be removed from the graph, and executed implicitly. It's a more elaborate graph transformation however, since it involves duplicating downstream transforms, and allowing PCollections to have multiple producers. For now, we ignore SDK side flattens (which are only sometimes permittable), and force Runner side flattens to not be fused, since runner side transforms can't fuse at this time.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

all,\r\n\r\nWe created a blog post for Apache beam about how we created a managed service for our Beam jobs on Kubernetes.

PR is to address inability to utilize SSL, as referenced in issue [21223](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21223), by surfacing the cluster builder [withSSL( SSLOptions sslOptions)](https://docs.datastax.com/en/drivers/java/3.11/com/datastax/driver/core/Cluster.Builder.html#withSSL-com.datastax.driver.core.SSLOptions-) method to allow the user to provide SSL configuration. I chose to allow the user to provide SSLOptions to allow different SSL strategies in cases where one user may want client to node encryption and client certificate authentication while another may just want client to node encryption.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- First time creating a PR for a non-work related project. Tried to follow the contribution documentation but please let me know if I need to include anything additional or if there are any processes I missed. Thanks.\r\n- Since this PR is surfacing builder ssl functionality from the Datastax driver, I didn't include unit tests to test their functionality. \r\n- Also, I don't believe I would be able to configure SSL on the embedded test cluster.\r\n- These changes have been tested with poc Dataflow job created via Dataflow classic template where truststore cert (self-signed) and password are retrieved at runtime and used to create an SSLContext which is then used to create SSLOptions. The pipeline reads from SQL Server and writes to a DSE 6.8 Cassandra cluster with SSL (TLS protocol) enabled, hosted in GCP. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.
