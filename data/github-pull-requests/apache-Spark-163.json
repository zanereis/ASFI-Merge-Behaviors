What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix `RollingGroupBy` and `ExpandingGroupBy` to follow latest pandas behavior.\r\n\r\n`RollingGroupBy` and `ExpandingGroupBy` no longer returns grouped-by column in values from pandas 1.3.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```python\r\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame({\"A\": [1, 1, 2, 3], \"B\": [0, 1, 2, 3]})\r\n>>>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMove final iteration of aggregation of RDD.treeAggregate to an executor with one partition and fetch that result to the driver\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. RDD.fold pulls all shuffle partitions to the driver to merge the result\r\n        a. Driver becomes a single point of failure in the case that there are a lot of partitions to do the final aggregation on\r\n2. Shuffle machinery at executors is much more robust/fault tolerant compared to fetching results to driver.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThe previous behavior always did the final aggregation in the driver. The user can now (optionally) provide a boolean config (default = false) ENABLE_EXECUTOR_TREE_AGGREGATE to do that final aggregation in a single partition executor before fetching the results to the driver. The only additional cost is that the user will see an extra stage in their job.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested via unit tests, and also tested on a cluster.\r\nThe screenshots showing the extra stage on a cluster are attached below (before vs after).\r\n![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24758726/128249830-eefc4bda-f737-4d68-960e-1d1907762538.png)\r\n![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24758726/128249838-be70bc95-9f39-489c-be17-c9c80c4846a4.png)\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-04T20:25:07Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T14:29:39Z","closed_at":"2021-08-24T14:29:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a9d9fbc1a8b3855c4b017366b7946be8407d4ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33644/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33644/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33644/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f728a02407c31faf4a13665c4763c13344e4036d","head":{"label":"akpatnam25:SPARK-36419","ref":"SPARK-36419","sha":"f728a02407c31faf4a13665c4763c13344e4036d","user":{"login":"akpatnam25","id":24758726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU4NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24758726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25","html_url":"https://github.com/akpatnam25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akpatnam25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1859d9bc859dc18bed84d916acc1ea15501c4914","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Move final iteration of aggregation of RDD.treeAggregate to an executor with one partition and fetch that result to the driver\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. RDD.fold pulls all shuffle partitions to the driver to merge the result \r\n   a. Driver becomes a single point of failure in the case that there are a lot of partitions to do the final aggregation on\r\n2. Shuffle machinery at executors is much more robust/fault tolerant compared to fetching results to driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe previous behavior always did the final aggregation in the driver. The user can now (optionally) provide a boolean config (default = false) `ENABLE_EXECUTOR_TREE_AGGREGATE` to do that final aggregation in a single partition executor before fetching the results to the driver. The only additional cost is that the user will see an extra stage in their job. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested via unit tests, and also tested on a cluster. \r\nThe screenshots showing the extra stage on a cluster are attached below (before vs after).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd \"num broadcast joins conversions\" and \"num skew join conversions\"\r\nmetrics to AdaptiveSparkPlanExec to report how many joins were changed to BHJ or had skew mitigated due to AQE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make it easy to get a sense of how much impact AQE had on an a complex query.\r\n\r\nIt's also useful for systems that collect metrics for later analysis of AQE effectiveness in large production deployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n2 new SQL metrics will now be emitted\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting and new Unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently `datetime.sql` contains a lot of tests and will be run 3 times: default mode, ansi mode, ntz mode. It wastes the test time and also large test files are hard to read.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to split it into smaller ones:\r\n1. `date.sql`, which contains date literals, functions and operations. It will be run twice with default and ansi mode.\r\n2. `timestamp.sql`, which contains timestamp (no ltz or ntz suffix) literals, functions and operations. It will be run 4 times: default mode + ans off, defaul mode + ansi on, ntz mode + ansi off, ntz mode + ansi on.\r\n3. `datetime_special.sql`, which create datetime values whose year is outside of [0, 9999]. This is a separated file as JDBC doesn't support them and need to ignore this test file. It will be run 4 times as well.\r\n4. `timestamp_ltz.sql`, which contains timestamp_ltz literals and constructors. It will be run twice with default and ntz mode, to make sure its result doesn't change with the timestamp mode. Note that, operations with ltz are tested by `timestamp.sql`\r\n5. `timestamp_ntz.sql`, which contains timestamp_ntz literals and constructors. It will be run twice with default and ntz mode, to make sure its result doesn't change with the timestamp mode. Note that, operations with ntz are tested by `timestamp.sql`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nreduce test run time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nN/A","created_at":"2021-08-04T17:08:58Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T04:56:46Z","closed_at":"2021-08-05T12:55:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9dfa77952a3f925cf7026bba5a077e88ebcd30a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0ad1afc2068af9c14eee16d79a384a47a2b378c8","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:test","ref":"test","sha":"0ad1afc2068af9c14eee16d79a384a47a2b378c8","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPush down Min/Max/Count to Parquet with the following restrictions:\r\n\r\n- nested types such as Array, Map or Struct will not be pushed down\r\n- Timestamp not pushed down because INT96 sort order is undefined, Parquet doesn't return statistics for INT96\r\n- If the aggregate column is on partition column, only Count will be pushed, Min or Max will not be pushed down because Parquet doesn't return max/min for partition column. \r\n- If somehow the file doesn't have stats for the aggregate columns, Spark will throw Exception.\r\n- Currently, if filter/GROUP BY is involved, Min/Max/Count will not be pushed down, but the restriction will be lifted if the filter or GROUP BY is on partition column (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36646 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36647)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince parquet has the statistics information for min, max and count, we want to take advantage of this info and push down Min/Max/Count to parquet layer for better performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, `SQLConf.PARQUET_AGGREGATE_PUSHDOWN_ENABLED` was added. If sets to true, we will push down Min/Max/Count to Parquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew test suites\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-04T16:39:19Z","updated_at":"2021-10-19T15:32:49Z","closed_at":"2021-10-11T05:20:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f819bf3c9925bffd916027b4ad1849e05f2ebec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/51ef0f2c919add3b75f483158a4e56b599dedc7e","head":{"label":"huaxingao:parquet_agg","ref":"parquet_agg","sha":"51ef0f2c919add3b75f483158a4e56b599dedc7e","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis reverts SPARK-31475, as there are always more concurrent jobs running in AQE mode, especially when running multiple queries at the same time. Currently, the broadcast timeout does not record accurately for the BroadcastQueryStageExec only, but also including the time waiting for being scheduled. If all the resources are currently being occupied for materializing other stages, it timeouts without a chance to run actually.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8326978/128169612-4c96c8f6-6f8e-48ed-8eaf-450f87982c3b.png)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe default value is 300s, and it's hard to adjust the timeout for AQE mode. Usually, you need an extremely large number for real-world cases. As you can see in the example, above, the timeout we used for it was 1800s, and obviously, it needed 3x more or something\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAQE is default now, we can make it more stable with this PR\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, broadcast timeout now is not used for AQE\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nmodified

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n* Split the test cases related to timestamp_ntz or timestamp_ltz functions from datetime.sql. \r\n* Add end-to-end tests for type constructor with `timestamp_ntz` and `timestamp_ltz`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n* Reduce the number of lines in `datetime.sql` from 300 to 200. It has a lot of test cases and will continue increasing. \r\n* The test cases related to timestamp_ntz or timestamp_ltz don't need to run again in datetime_legacy.sql. The refactor reduces unnecessary test runs.\r\n* Add end-to-end tests for new type constructors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request proposes to exclude the appName from the sourceName in StreamingSource following the example of the other sources, e.g. `ExecutorMetricsSource`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe StreamingSource includes the appName in its sourceName. However, the appName should not be handled by the StreamingSource. It is already handled by the MetricsSystem. See all other MetricSources, e.g. ExecutorMetricsSource.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important? See this part from the [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#metrics):\r\n\r\n> Often times, users want to be able to track the metrics across apps for driver and executors, which is hard to do with application ID (i.e. spark.app.id) since it changes with every invocation of the app. For such use cases, a custom namespace can be specified for metrics reporting using spark.metrics.namespace configuration property. If, say, users wanted to set the metrics namespace to the name of the application, they can set the spark.metrics.namespace property to a value like ${spark.app.name}. This value is then expanded appropriately by Spark and is used as the root namespace of the metrics system.\r\n\r\nThis is only possible if the MetricsSystem handles the namespace which it does. But the StreamingSource additionally adds the appName in its sourceName, thus there is no way to configure a namespace that does not include the appName.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe proposed change conforms to the documentation. See [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html#metrics).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe always do file truncate operation before delete a write failed file held by `DiskBlockObjectWriter`, a typical process is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!success) {\r\n  // This code path only happens if an exception was thrown above before we set success;\r\n  // close our stuff and let the exception be thrown further\r\n  writer.revertPartialWritesAndClose()\r\n  if (file.exists()) {\r\n    if (!file.delete()) {\r\n      logWarning(s\"Error deleting ${file}\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe `revertPartialWritesAndClose` method will reverts writes that haven't been committed yet,  but it doesn't seem necessary in the current scene. \r\n\r\nSo this pr add a new method  to `DiskBlockObjectWriter` named `closeAndDelete()`,  the new method just revert write metrics and delete the write failed file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid unnecessary file operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd a new method  to `DiskBlockObjectWriter` named `closeAndDelete().\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-04T03:45:22Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T07:43:58Z","closed_at":"2021-12-20T08:52:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7ec9957ca4238dc80842ac753c09f8e3ec7fabf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33628/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33628/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33628/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c98ff1dd4fd69ed80fdf2d05852abd7825085ef5","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-36406","ref":"SPARK-36406","sha":"c98ff1dd4fd69ed80fdf2d05852abd7825085ef5","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement DataFrame.mode (along index axis).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nGet the mode(s) of each element along the selected axis is a common functionality, which is supported in pandas. We should support that.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. `DataFrame.mode` can be used now.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> psdf = ps.DataFrame(\r\n...

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33140 to propose a simpler idea for integrating columnar execution into AQE.\r\n\r\nInstead of making the `ColumnarToRowExec` and `RowToColumnarExec` dynamic to handle `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec`, it's simpler to let the consumer decide if it needs columnar output or not, and pass a boolean flag to `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec`.\r\n\r\nFor Spark vendors, they can set the flag differently in their custom columnar parquet writing command when the input plan is `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec`.\r\n\r\nOne argument is if we need to look at the final plan of AQE and consume the data differently (either row or columnar format). I can't think of a use case and I think we can always statically know if the AQE plan should output row or columnar data.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode simplification.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-35286 replace `SessionState.start` with `SessionState.setCurrentSessionState`, but `SessionState.close` will create a `HiveMetaStoreClient` , connect to the Hive Meta Store Server, and then load all functions.\r\n\r\nSPARK-35556 (Remove close HiveClient's SessionState) When the Hive version used is greater than or equal to 2.1, `SessionState.close` is not called and the resource dir of HiveClient is not cleaned up.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up the hive resources dir temporary directory.\r\nAvoid wasting resources and accelerate the exit speed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a new type of error message in BlockPushErrorHandler which indicates the PushblockStream message is received after a new application attempt has started. This error message should be correctly handled in client without retrying the block push.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen we get a block push failure because of the too old attempt, we will not retry pushing the block nor log the exception on the client side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd the corresponding unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-03T03:41:43Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T02:59:21Z","closed_at":"2021-08-16T18:59:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1184589e2fbc77b070233d5f47e8addf9809767a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33617/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33617/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33617/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/96c04d21be8fde57328a44a03f8887602ee4f330","head":{"label":"zhuqi-lucas:master","ref":"master","sha":"96c04d21be8fde57328a44a03f8887602ee4f330","user":{"login":"zhuqi-lucas","id":12184649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12184649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuqi-lucas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":315535227,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU1MzUyMjc=","name":"spark","full_name":"zhuqi-lucas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhuqi-lucas","id":12184649,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTg0NjQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12184649?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuqi-lucas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuqi-lucas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhuqi-lucas/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith SPARK-32922, we added a change that ShuffleBlockId can have a negative mapId. This was to support push-based shuffle where -1 as mapId indicated a push-merged block. However with SPARK-32923, a different type of BlockId was introduced - ShuffleMergedId, but reverting the change to ShuffleBlockId was missed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis reverts the changes to `ShuffleBlockId` which will never have a negative mapId.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified the unit test to verify the newly added ShuffleMergedBlockId.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-03T03:10:12Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T03:34:49Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T06:35:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05db959e713e4440919a3f5f63a28d64ad2bbb29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ddae214fa68826d15519d67e713a61aae72919e","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-36389","ref":"SPARK-36389","sha":"9ddae214fa68826d15519d67e713a61aae72919e","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe have run performance evaluations on the version of push-based shuffle committed to upstream so far, and have identified a few places for further improvements:\r\n1. On the server side, we have noticed that the usage of `String.format`, especially when receiving a block push request, has a much higher overhead compared with string concatenation.\r\n2. On the server side, the usage of `Throwables.getStackTraceAsString` in the `ErrorHandler.shouldRetryError` and `ErrorHandler.shouldLogError` has generated quite some overhead.\r\n\r\nThese 2 issues are related to how we are currently handling certain common block push failures.\r\nWe are communicating such failures via `RPCFailure` by transmitting the exception stack trace.\r\nThis generates the overhead on both server and client side for creating these exceptions and makes checking the type of failures fragile and inefficient with string matching of exception stack trace.\r\nTo address these, this PR also proposes to encode the common block push failure as an error code and send that back to the client with a proper RPC message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove shuffle service efficiency for push-based shuffle.\r\nImprove code robustness for handling block push failures.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fail properly so JSON parser can proceed and parse the input with the permissive mode.\r\nPreviously, we passed `null`s as are, the root `InternalRow`s became `null`s, and it causes the query fails even with permissive mode on.\r\nNow, we fail explicitly if `null` is passed when the input array contains `null`.\r\n\r\nNote that this is consistent with non-array JSON input:\r\n\r\n**Permissive mode:**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.json(Seq(\"\"\"{\"a\": \"str\"}\"\"\", \"\"\"null\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n```\r\nres0: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([str], [null])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Failfast mode**:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"mode\", \"failfast\").json(Seq(\"\"\"{\"a\": \"str\"}\"\"\", \"\"\"null\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Malformed records are detected in record parsing. Parse Mode: FAILFAST. To process malformed records as null result, try setting the option 'mode' as 'PERMISSIVE'.\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.FailureSafeParser.parse(FailureSafeParser.scala:70)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.$anonfun$json$7(DataFrameReader.scala:540)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$11.nextCur(Iterator.scala:484)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the permissive mode to proceed and parse without throwing an exception.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n**Permissive mode:**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.json(Seq(\"\"\"[{\"a\": \"str\"}, null]\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage1.processNext(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator.hasNext(BufferedRowIterator.java:43)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$anon$1.hasNext(WholeStageCodegenExec.scala:759)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nres0: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([null])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE that this behaviour is consistent when JSON object is malformed:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a int\").json(Seq(\"\"\"[{\"a\": 123}, {123123}, {\"a\": 123}]\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nres0: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([null])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we're parsing _one_ JSON array, related records all fail together.\r\n\r\n**Failfast mode:**\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"mode\", \"failfast\").json(Seq(\"\"\"[{\"a\": \"str\"}, null]\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage1.processNext(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator.hasNext(BufferedRowIterator.java:43)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$anon$1.hasNext(WholeStageCodegenExec.scala:759)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Malformed records are detected in record parsing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds test considering the case `spark.sql.legacy.interval.enabled` is `true` for SPARK-35815.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-35815 (#33456) changes `Dataset.withWatermark` to accept ANSI interval literals as `delayThreshold` but I noticed the change didn't work with `spark.sql.legacy.interval.enabled=true`.\r\nWe can't detect this issue because there is no test which considers the legacy interval type at that time.\r\nIn SPARK-36323 (#33551), this issue was resolved but it's better to add test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test.","created_at":"2021-08-02T06:38:05Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T14:51:08Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T10:48:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ab508ddf0c98298a7ffdcb5bb08dcdb90819faf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr makes `DecimalPrecision` only add necessary cast similar to [`ImplicitTypeCasts`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/96c2919988ddf78d104103876d8d8221e8145baa/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/TypeCoercion.scala#L675-L678). For example:\r\n```\r\nEqualTo(AttributeReference(\"d1\", DecimalType(5, 2))(), AttributeReference(\"d2\", DecimalType(2, 1))())\r\n```\r\nIt will add a useless cast to _d1_:\r\n```\r\n(cast(d1#6 as decimal(5,2)) = cast(d2#7 as decimal(5,2)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Avoid adding unnecessary cast. Although it will be removed by  `SimplifyCasts` later.\r\n2. I'm trying to add an extended rule similar to `PullOutGroupingExpressions`. The current behavior will introduce additional alias. For example: `cast(d1 as decimal(5,2)) as cast_d1`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, v2 ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMNS does not check duplicates for the user specified columns. For example, \r\n```\r\nspark.sql(s\"CREATE TABLE $t (id int) USING $v2Format\")\r\nspark.sql(\"ALTER TABLE $t ADD COLUMNS (data string, data string)\")\r\n```\r\ndoesn't fail the analysis, and it's up to the catalog implementation to handle it. For v1 command, the duplication is checked before invoking the catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo check the duplicate columns during analysis and be consistent with v1 command.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the above will command will print out the fllowing:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Found duplicate column(s) in the user specified columns: `data`\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to support raw string literal which escape no character using `\\`.\r\nThe raw string literal is the form of `r\"...\"` or `r'...'` like the syntax BigQuery and Python supports.\r\n\r\nActually, there is no standard way to represent raw string literals.\r\n\r\nIn PostgreSQL, any special character isn't escaped by \\ unless a string literal starts with E prefix.\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-CONSTANTS\r\n\r\nIn MySQL, special characters in a string literal are not escaped if NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES is enabled.\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-literals.html\r\n\r\nIn MsSQLServer, any special character isn't escaped by \\ but STRING_ESCAPE function can escape such characters.\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/string-escape-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15\r\n\r\nBut BigQuery supports `r\"...\"` and `r'...'` forms so this PR proposes this syntax for the purpose.\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical#literals\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current master, sometimes it's too confusable to represent JSON and regex in a string literal if they contain backslash.\r\nFor example, in JSON, `\\` needs to be escaped like as follows.\r\n```\r\n{\"a\": \"\\\\\"}\r\n```\r\nBut, if the JSON above is represented in a string literal, further two `\\` are needed because string literal also requires `\\` to be escaped.\r\n```\r\nSELECT from_json('{\"a\": \"\\\\\\\\\"}', 'a string')\r\n{\"a\":\"\\\"}\r\n```\r\nWith the raw string literal, we can represent such JSON like as follows.\r\n```\r\nSELECT from_json(r'{\"a\": \"\\\\\"}', 'a string')\r\n{\"a\":\"\\\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. This PR just extends the existing syntax.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new test.\r\nI also confirmed that the modified document is successfully built with `SKIP_API=1 bundle exec jekyll build`.\r\n![raw_string_literal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/129223184-3bb4e206-f40f-42d2-a128-0cd8fc83b9c9.png)\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-31T16:35:39Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T06:32:09Z","closed_at":"2021-08-19T03:37:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"762465daf5a33dd3dbd965cb4d7e5e90daf02ee9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec963efa51cd02cf6816d4eebcf645c709e43f09","head":{"label":"sarutak:raw-string-literal","ref":"raw-string-literal","sha":"ec963efa51cd02cf6816d4eebcf645c709e43f09","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix up some minor Java issues:\r\n\r\n- Some int*int multiplications that widen to long maybe could overflow\r\n- Unnecessarily non-static inner classes\r\n- Some tests \"catch (AssertionError)\" and do nothing\r\n- Manual array iteration vs very slightly faster/simpler foreach\r\n- Incorrect generic types that just happen to not cause a runtime error\r\n- Missed opportunities for try-close\r\n- Mutable enums\r\n- .. and a few other minor things\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSome are minor but clear fixes; some may have a marginal perf impact or avoid a bug later. Also: maybe avoid future PRs to address these one by one.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `MetricsSystem` takes care of proper naming of all metrics. By default, the root namespace is the value of `spark.app.id`. A custom namespace can be specified for metrics reporting using `spark.metrics.namespace` configuration property. \r\n\r\nA `StreamingSource` gets registered in the `MetricsSystem`, however, it additionally includes the `appName` in its `sourceName`. This makes it impossible to configure a common namespace excluding the `appName`.\r\n\r\nThis pull request proposes to exclude the appName from the sourceName in StreamingSource following the example of the other sources, e.g. `ExecutorMetricsSource`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHomogeneous naming scheme across all metrics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe proposed change conforms to the documentation.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate Coverage report from Jenkins to GitHub Actions by setting a dailly cron job.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor some background, currently PySpark code coverage is being reported in this specific Jenkins job: https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7/\r\n\r\nBecause of the security issue between [Codecov service](https://app.codecov.io/gh/) and Jenkins machines, we had to work around by manually hosting a coverage site via GitHub pages, see also https://spark-test.github.io/pyspark-coverage-site/ by @spark-test account (which is shared to only subset of PMC members).\r\n\r\nSince we now run the build via GitHub Actions, we can leverage [Codecov plugin](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action), and remove the workaround we used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nVirtually no. Coverage site (UI) might change but the information it holds should be virtually the same.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested:\r\n- Scheduled run: https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/actions/runs/1082261484\r\n- Coverage report: https://codecov.io/gh/HyukjinKwon/spark/tree/73f0291a7df1eda98045cd759303aac1c2a9c929/python/pyspark\r\n- Run against

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a partial revert of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33567 that keeps the logic to skip mlflow related tests if that's not installed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's consistent with other libraries, e.g) PyArrow.\r\nIt also fixes up the potential dev breakage (see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33567#issuecomment-889841829)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is a partial revert. CI should test it out too.","created_at":"2021-07-30T11:58:01Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:58Z","closed_at":"2021-07-30T13:28:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3701220f1be1f9726ffc12fdd941798876df431","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33589/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33589/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33589/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1f74758d48806fd8e6fccb13b235acc0f232b2f2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-36254","ref":"SPARK-36254","sha":"1f74758d48806fd8e6fccb13b235acc0f232b2f2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs per https://orc.apache.org/docs/types.html, ORC includes two different forms of timestamps from the SQL world:\r\n\r\n`Timestamp` is a date and time without a time zone, which does not change based on the time zone of the reader.\r\n`Timestamp with local time zone` is a fixed instant in time, which does change based on the time zone of the reader.\r\n\r\nSo the contrast relationship of timestamp between Spark and ORC as follows:\r\n- `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` => `Timestamp with local time zone`.\r\n- `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` => `Timestamp`\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in Spark 3.1 or prior, Spark considered ORC `Timestamp` as `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` mistakely.\r\nThe behavior is not correct. To keep backward compatibility, we not change the mistake now.\r\nSince 3.2, with the support of timestamp without time zone type:\r\n\r\n- For the ORC writer, we will have to map both Spark’s `TimestampLTZ` and `TimestampNTZ` as ORC’s `TimestampNTZ` for backward compatibility. In addition, the ORC should write the column type in ORC’s type information with the key “spark.sql.catalyst.type”.\r\n- For the ORC reader. If the type information contains the key “spark.sql.catalyst.type”, infer the data type as per the value\r\nOtherwise, given an ORC `TimestampLTZ` column, we will infer it as Spark’s `TimestampType`; given an ORC `TimestampNTZ`, the inferred result is `TimestampType`(`TimestampLTZ`) so that the behavior is consistent with older version Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDocking `TimestampNTZ` type in Spark and `Timestamp` in ORC.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\nSpark will read/write the `TimestampNTZ`/`Timestamp` in ORC.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-30T11:17:30Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T07:17:34Z","closed_at":"2021-11-18T02:46:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f23f4d9ad271fa4479d8c0ac6010150211fb2d26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33588/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33588/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33588/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2c213c398530c5d4d0e95fa7eedb44179fe58045","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-36346","ref":"SPARK-36346","sha":"2c213c398530c5d4d0e95fa7eedb44179fe58045","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn file based data source, there are two sets of filters: partition filters and data filters. For example, supposed there are c1 and c2 in table test and p is the partition column. For query\r\n```\r\nSELECT COUNT(c1) FROM test WHERE p = 0 AND c2 = 8\r\n```\r\n`p = 0` is the partition filter and `c2 = 8` is the data filter. \r\n\r\nWith sql based data source, there is no problem to push down aggregate with filter to the underlying data source, because the data source will process the query. However, for file based data source, we can't push down aggregate with filter. This is because file based data source doesn't process query. For the aggregate (Min/Max/Count) push down, we simply take advantage of the statistics information in the data source. For example, in parquet, we read Min/Max/Count from the footer. For simple aggregate such as `SELECT COUNT(c1) FROM test`, we can push down because footer has statistics about the total number of column `c1`, but if filter is involved such as `SELECT COUNT(c1) FROM test WHERE c2=8`, we can't push down any more because footer only has statistics info for total num of column of `c1`, it doesn't know among these columns, how many of them can meet the condition `c2=8`. So in the aggregate push checking logic, for file based aggregate, I simply block aggregate push down if there is filter involved. However, we can lift the restriction if the filter is only partition filter, because we can simply prune off the unneeded partitions. For example, `SELECT COUNT(c1) FROM test WHERE p = 0`, we can prune off the partitions with p!=0, for the remaining partition p=0, we can just have query `SELECT COUNT(c1) FROM test` and still push down the aggregate to data source.\r\n\r\nIn order to lift the above restriction, at the time of checking whether to push down the aggregate, we should have already separated the partition filters and data filters. However, in the current code, we won't separate these two filters until `PruneFileSourcePartitions`. This PR is proposed to separates partition filters and data filters in `PushDownUtils`, so we can use this info to determine whether we can push down aggregate if filter is involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, DSv2 partition filters and data filters are separated in `PruneFileSourcePartitions`. This PR refactors the code and separates partition filters and data filters in `PushDownUtils`, so in `V2ScanRelationPushDown`, we can tell if the filters are only partition filters and decide whether to push down Max/Min/Count to data source.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test suites\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-30T07:17:14Z","updated_at":"2021-08-05T16:56:18Z","closed_at":"2021-08-05T08:28:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7614bc68f1a903e5375f4bdd5e9f13a91eac309","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bbc85db716de1db24bdb67f2ca9075dcaa648ded","head":{"label":"huaxingao:par_filter","ref":"par_filter","sha":"bbc85db716de1db24bdb67f2ca9075dcaa648ded","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark should check result plan's output schema name\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn current code, some optimizer rule may change plan's output schema, since in the code we always use semantic equal to check output, but it may change the plan's output schema.\r\nFor example, for SchemaPruning, if we have a plan\r\n```\r\nProject[a, B]\r\n|--Scan[A, b, c]\r\n```\r\nthe origin output schema is `a, B`, after SchemaPruning. it become\r\n```\r\nProject[A, b]\r\n|--Scan[A, b]\r\n```\r\nIt change the plan's schema. when we use CTAS, the schema is same as query plan's output.\r\nThen since we change the schema, it not consistent with origin SQL. So we need to check final result plan's schema with origin plan's schema\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisted

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to ban `YearMonthIntervalType` and `DayTimeIntervalType` at the analysis phase while creating a table using a built-in filed-based datasource or writing a dataset to such datasource. In particular, add the following case:\r\n```scala\r\ncase _: DayTimeIntervalType | _: YearMonthIntervalType => false\r\n```\r\nto all methods that override either:\r\n- V2 `FileTable.supportsDataType()`\r\n- V1 `FileFormat.supportDataType()`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL, and output a proper error message at the analysis phase.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes but ANSI interval types haven't released yet. So, for users this is new behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 \"test:testOnly

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33352 , to simplify the JDBC aggregate pushdown:\r\n1. We should get the schema of the aggregate query by asking the JDBC server, instead of calculating it by ourselves. This can simplify the code a lot, and is also more robust: the data type of SUM may vary in different databases, it's fragile to assume they are always the same as Spark.\r\n2. because of 1, now we can remove the `dataType` property from the public `Sum` expression.\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains some small improvements:\r\n1. Spark should deduplicate the aggregate expressions before pushing them down.\r\n2. Improve the `toString` of public aggregate expressions to make them more SQL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR does minor changes in the file SaveAsHiveFile.scala.\r\n\r\nIt contains the below changes :\r\n\r\n1. dropping getParent from below part of code\r\n===============================\r\nif (extURI.getScheme == \"viewfs\") {\r\ngetExtTmpPathRelTo(path.getParent, hadoopConf, stagingDir)\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHive is creating .staging directories inside \"/db/table\" location but Spark-sql creates .staging directories inside /db/\" location when we use hadoop federation(viewFs). But works as expected (creating .staging inside /db/table/ location for other filesystems like hdfs).\r\n\r\nIn HIVE:\r\n```\r\n beeline\r\n> use dicedb;\r\n> insert into table part_test partition (j=1) values (1);\r\n...\r\nINFO  : Loading data to table dicedb.part_test partition (j=1) from **viewfs://cloudera/user/daisuke/dicedb/part_test/j=1/.hive-staging_hive_2021-07-19_13-04-44_989_6775328876605030677-1/-ext-10000** \r\n```\r\n\r\nbut spark's behaviour,\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> use dicedb;\r\nspark-sql> insert into table part_test partition (j=2) values (2);\r\n21/07/19 13:07:37 INFO FileUtils: Creating directory if it doesn't exist: **viewfs://cloudera/user/daisuke/dicedb/.hive-staging_hive_2021-07-19_13-07-37_317_5083528872437596950-1**\r\n... \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason why we require this change is , if we allow spark-sql to create .staging directory inside /db/ location then we will end-up with security issues. We need to provide permission for \"viewfs:///db/\" location to all users who submit spark jobs.\r\n\r\nAfter this change is applied spark-sql creates .staging inside /db/table/,  similar to hive, as below,\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> use dicedb;\r\n21/07/28 00:22:47 INFO SparkSQLCLIDriver: Time taken: 0.929 seconds\r\nspark-sql> insert into table part_test partition (j=8) values (8);\r\n21/07/28 00:23:25 INFO HiveMetaStoreClient: Closed a connection to metastore, current connections: 1\r\n21/07/28 00:23:26 INFO FileUtils: Creating directory if it doesn't exist: **viewfs://cloudera/user/daisuke/dicedb/part_test/.hive-staging_hive_2021-07-28_00-23-26_109_4548714524589026450-1** \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason why we don't see this issue in Hive but only occurs in Spark-sql:\r\n\r\nIn hive, \"/db/table/tmp\" directory structure is passed for path and hence path.getParent returns \"db/table/\" . But in Spark we just pass \"/db/table\" so it is not required to use \"path.getParent\" for hadoop federation(viewfs)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n No\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually by creating hive-sql.jar","created_at":"2021-07-29T11:02:59Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T17:43:53Z","closed_at":"2021-08-27T19:58:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5cabee8601c72fe8ea2b1d4727768cef45bc5cc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/575fbc63b370efbffe8c8327983b2de2b8a60247","head":{"label":"senthh:viewfs-792392","ref":"viewfs-792392","sha":"575fbc63b370efbffe8c8327983b2de2b8a60247","user":{"login":"senthh","id":9917543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTc1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9917543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh","html_url":"https://github.com/senthh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":276009775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzYwMDk3NzU=","name":"spark-1","full_name":"senthh/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"senthh","id":9917543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTc1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9917543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh","html_url":"https://github.com/senthh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/senthh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/senthh/spark-1","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to implement `distributed-sequence` index in Scala side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Avoid unnecessary (de)serialization\r\n- Keep the nullability in the input DataFrame when `distributed-sequence` is enabled. During the serialization, all fields are being nullable for now (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32775#discussion_r645882104)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo to end users since pandas API on Spark is not released yet.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pyspark.pandas as ps\r\nps.set_option('compute.default_index_type',

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33012, where we defined `FileNameSpec` in the file of `FileCommitProtocol.scala`. When making the change of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33432, I found the `FileNameSpec` is not accessible outside of its file, because the companion object `FileCommitProtocol` exists. So the fix is to move the `FileNameSpec` definition into companion object `FileCommitProtocol`, then it can be accessible outside.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix the code logic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit test, and end-to-end test in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33432 as

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMove both `PruneFileSourcePartitionsSuite` and `PrunePartitionSuiteBase` to the package `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources`. Did a few refactoring to enable this.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently both `PruneFileSourcePartitionsSuite` and `PrunePartitionSuiteBase` are in package `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution` which doesn't look correct as these tests are not specific to Hive. Therefore, it's better to move them into `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources`, the same place where the rule `PruneFileSourcePartitions` is at.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's just test refactoring.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsing existing tests:\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/testOnly *PruneFileSourcePartitionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a new config to allow K8s API server-side caching for pod listing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark currently requests the most recent data which should be consistent. New configuration looses the restriction to reduce the server-side overhead by allowing K8S API server side caching.\r\n\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#the-resourceversion-parameter\r\n\r\n- `resourceVersion`: unset\r\n> Most Recent: Return data at the most recent resource version. The returned data must be consistent (i.e. served from etcd via a quorum read).\r\n\r\n- `resourceVersion`: \"0\"\r\n> Any: Return data at any resource version. The newest available resource version is preferred, but strong consistency is not required; data at any resource version may be served.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this is a new feature to reduce the K8s API server side overhead.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes are proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis proposes to add SQLMetrics instrumentation for Python UDF execution, including Pandas UDF, and related operations such as MapInPandas and MapInArrow.\r\nThe proposed metrics are:\r\n\r\n- data sent to Python workers\r\n- data returned from Python workers\r\n- number of output rows\r\n  \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis aims at improving monitoring and performance troubleshooting of Python UDFs.\r\nIn particular it is intended as an aid to answer performance-related questions such as:\r\nwhy is the UDF slow?, how much work has been done so far?, etc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSQL metrics are made available in the WEB UI.  \r\nSee the following examples:  \r\n\r\n![image1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13038693/PandasUDF_ArrowEvalPython_Metrics.png)\r\n  \r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested + a Python unit test and a Scala unit test have been added.\r\n\r\nExample code used for testing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, pandas_udf\r\nimport time\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"long\")\r\ndef test_pandas(col1):\r\n  time.sleep(0.02)\r\n  return col1 * col1\r\n\r\nspark.udf.register(\"test_pandas\", test_pandas)\r\nspark.sql(\"select rand(42)*rand(51)*rand(12) col1 from range(10000000)\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t1\")\r\nspark.sql(\"select max(test_pandas(col1)) from t1\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is used to test with more data pushed to the Python workers:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, pandas_udf\r\nimport time\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"long\")\r\ndef test_pandas(col1,col2,col3,col4,col5,col6,col7,col8,col9,col10,col11,col12,col13,col14,col15,col16,col17):\r\n  time.sleep(0.02)\r\n  return col1\r\n\r\nspark.udf.register(\"test_pandas\", test_pandas)\r\nspark.sql(\"select rand(42)*rand(51)*rand(12) col1 from range(10000000)\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t1\")\r\nspark.sql(\"select max(test_pandas(col1,col1+1,col1+2,col1+3,col1+4,col1+5,col1+6,col1+7,col1+8,col1+9,col1+10,col1+11,col1+12,col1+13,col1+14,col1+15,col1+16)) from t1\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis (from the Spark doc) has been used to test with MapInPandas, where the number of output rows is different from the number of input rows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, PandasUDFType\r\n\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 21), (2, 30)], (\"id\", \"age\"))\r\n\r\ndef filter_func(iterator):\r\n    for pdf in iterator:\r\n        yield pdf[pdf.id == 1]\r\n\r\ndf.mapInPandas(filter_func, schema=df.schema).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis for testing BatchEvalPython and metrics related to data transfer (bytes sent and received):\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n\r\n@udf\r\ndef test_udf(col1, col2):\r\n     return col1 * col1\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"select id, 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' col2 from range(10)\").select(test_udf(\"id\", \"col2\")).collect()\r\n```","created_at":"2021-07-28T12:47:57Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T19:34:40Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T09:04:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42580c9a8c70fb30459d144a655694557670c052","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`ExternalAppendOnlyMap.spill` and `ExternalSorter.spill` call  `revertPartialWritesAndClose` method when `objectsWritten == 0` as follows:\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\ntry {\r\n      while (inMemoryIterator.hasNext) {\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        if (objectsWritten == serializerBatchSize) {\r\n          flush()\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      if (objectsWritten > 0) {\r\n        flush()\r\n        writer.close()\r\n      } else {\r\n        writer.revertPartialWritesAndClose()\r\n      }\r\n      success = true\r\n    } finally {\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `objectsWritten` is 0,  all data has been `flush()` and nothing needs to be revert,  and `revertPartialWritesAndClose()`  will add some unnecessary file operations like file reopen and truncate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReplace `revertPartialWritesAndClose()` with `close()` in `ExternalSorter.spill` and `ExternalAppendOnlyMap.spill` to reduce some unnecessary file operations like file reopen and truncate.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n2. Add new Test cases to verify `spill behavior not change`\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-28T07:40:21Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T07:34:48Z","closed_at":"2021-08-10T02:58:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce69e43aa05720aacd47a4b2f8066009c38da96d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33556/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33556/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33556/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a076c87d9299053c31d51cfd4350c102e5be931b","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:revertPartialWritesAndClose-2-close","ref":"revertPartialWritesAndClose-2-close","sha":"a076c87d9299053c31d51cfd4350c102e5be931b","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix `Series`/`Index.copy()` to drop extra columns.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `Series`/`Index.copy()` keeps the copy of the anchor DataFrame which holds unnecessary columns.\r\nWe can drop those when `Series`/`Index.copy()`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to update Sessionization examples to use native support of session window. It also adds the example for PySpark as native support of session window is available to PySpark as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe should guide the simplest way to achieve the same workload. I'll provide another example for cases we can't do with native support of session window.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.","created_at":"2021-07-27T22:50:58Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T10:30:46Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T03:10:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c103c76011174162a9eab2ecb826c88df6d26bea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix `IndexOpsMixin.hasnans` to use `IndexOpsMixin.isnull().any()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`IndexOpsMixin.hasnans` has a potential issue to cause `a window function inside an aggregate function` error.\r\nAlso it returns a wrong value when the `Series`/`Index` is empty.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> ps.Series([]).hasnans\r\nNone\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> pd.Series([]).hasnans\r\nFalse\r\n```\r\n\r\n`IndexOpsMixin.any()` is safe for both cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n`IndexOpsMixin.hasnans` will return `False` when empty.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded some tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-27T21:44:09Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T01:24:09Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T00:21:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0c3f66033873d30e07d72de6fe7894813a130f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33547/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33547/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33547/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e5f8df9ac1bb45401b5a3865c0feb949226d26dc","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-36310/hasnan","ref":"issues/SPARK-36310/hasnan","sha":"e5f8df9ac1bb45401b5a3865c0feb949226d26dc","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror
