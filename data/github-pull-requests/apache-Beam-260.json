Fixes some import related warnings and enabled related pylint rules.\n- Replaced (or removed) invalid pylint directives in the g-\\* form.\n- Use pep8 for blank line related style check. pylint does not check\n  for pep8 related to pep8. And pep8 is not configurable for indentations.\n  So we need both tools.\n- Fixed existing lint error related to blank lines.\n\nNotes:\n- ~~I excluded 3 files for the below usage:~~ (Moved the type variables to the top of the file instead.)\n\n```\nT = TypeVariable('T')\nwith_input_types(T)\n@with_output_types(List[T])\nclass TopCombineFn(core.CombineFn):\n```\n\nHere pep8 style requires 2 blank lines between first and second lines, even\nthough they are logically connected. And there is no option to suppress this\nerror locally.\n- These tools verify that imports follow the style as defined in here: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports . This guideline requires the imports to be in standard library / third party / local imports. This does not necessarily result in an alphabetic import order.\n","created_at":"2016-06-28T01:22:23Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T01:37:09Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T01:28:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7bb5a625a92fb0395ffa84cae8d21da850b283e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/545/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/545/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/545/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/08d4c752d780022a4976c1654c3ec06312914d0f","head":{"label":"aaltay:morelint","ref":"morelint","sha":"08d4c752d780022a4976c1654c3ec06312914d0f","user":{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61246731,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTI0NjczMQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"aaltay/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay/beam","description":"Mirror

change introduces a pylint rule to keep the code base in a consistent state. Pylint configuration is heavily influenced by the existing standards in the code. Even with this there were multiple pylint issues. In order to make this change submit locking and also affect the others minimally I made the following choices:\n- Enabled line length (80 chars), and indentation rules (2 spaces, and 4 spaces after parentheses.).\n- Disabled all other rules. I will work on fixing violations of those and enabling them one by one.\n- Run pylint only on those files under python/sdks/apache_beam/*_/_.py and that changed compared to python_sdk branch HEAD. Note that this is files changed not lines changed.\n- Made it submit blocking. Travis will fail if there are lint errors.\n\nYou can install pylint (pip install pylint) and run it locally:\n\n$ cd sdks/python\nTo run on all files:\n\n$ pylint apache_beam\n\nTo run on all changed files (Diff of last commit to python-sdk branch HEAD):\n$

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [*] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [*] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [*] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [*] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThe method to call for a DoFnWithContext requires reflection since the\nshape of the parameters may change. Doing so in each processElement call\nputs this refelection in the hot path.\n\nThis PR introduces a DoFnInvoker interface which is bound to a specific\nDoFnWithContext and delegates the three important methods (startBundle,\nprocessElement, finishBundle).\n\nIt uses byte-buddy to generate a simple trampoline implementation of\nthe DoFnInvoker class for each type of DoFnWithContext.\n\nThis leads to 2-3x better performance in micro-benchmarks of
