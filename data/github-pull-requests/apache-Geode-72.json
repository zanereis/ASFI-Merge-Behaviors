PR seeks to fix a flaky test. The test was checking for asynchronous logging of a warning, then carrying out the action that should stop the warning from happening again. However, this leaves a gap for the warning to be logged an additional time and the test checks to make sure that no more invocations are made on the logger. I have changed it to instead check that no additional loggings of the warning occur AFTER the action that should stop the warning completes.\r\n\r\n@dschneider-pivotal \r\n@pivotal-eshu \r\n@lgallinat

with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\nI don't think this is applicable to `JUnit3CacheTestCase`, and the other refactors I've made will mostly have no effect on the code running.\r\n\r\n- [n/a] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.

pull request allows users to conduct parallel import and export of snapshots through gfsh. Because multiple snapshot files may be present on a given member for import, a \"directory\" option needed to be added to import, to import all snapshot files in that location (this is required for parallel import: the \"file\" parameter is ignored when \"parallel\" is true). For export, the same use of \"directory\" is needed, so that saving all snapshot files to a shared network storage device is possible. The \"directory\" parameter can also be used when \"parallel\" is false, but only files from the specified member will be imported (export will still be a single file). Note: parallel is only supported in partitioned regions, if \"parallel\" is set to true on other types of regions, it will be ignored.","created_at":"2017-08-31T18:09:36Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T23:21:41Z","closed_at":"2017-09-08T23:21:41Z","merged_at":"2017-09-08T23:21:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f0a1d782766348fb8c5fdc6b7c364f49641beab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/753/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/753/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/753/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/2c55f4f183517bd3158e0b8908fd0e81d882b42a","head":{"label":"nreich:feature/GEODE-3283","ref":"feature/GEODE-3283","sha":"2c55f4f183517bd3158e0b8908fd0e81d882b42a","user":{"login":"nreich","id":960205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDIwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/960205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich","html_url":"https://github.com/nreich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92880124,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Mjg4MDEyNA==","name":"geode","full_name":"nreich/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nreich","id":960205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDIwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/960205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich","html_url":"https://github.com/nreich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nreich/geode","description":"Mirror

When a connection is initialized, a readAckThread may be alive from a previous incarnation.\r\n\t* This AckThread will be stuck on a read socket with no timeout as nothing was dispatched.\r\n\t* Also while it was stuck on the read, it will hold a connection lifecycle read lock\r\n\t* The initialize connection needs a connection life cycle write lock to start the connection but the read lock is held by the ack thread.\r\n\t* This results in a deadlock and eventually a hang.\r\n\t* Another situation is that we set the flag isStopped for the event processor before actually shutting down the diapatcher and ack thread.\r\n\t* So after the flag is set and before actually shutting down the dispatcher and ackThread, a gateway proxy stomper thread gets in between these two steps of execution.\r\n\t* The stomper thread checks the isStopped flag, which was set to true, and proceeds to destroy the connection pool. However the dispatcher and ackThread were still running.\r\n\t* This results in a out of heap memory exception while the ack thread is reading from the socket while connection pool was destroyed.\r\n\t* To solve this issue, the stomper thread checks if the event processor and dispatcher exists, if true then we close the input streams before destroying the connection pool.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

addresses GEODE-3400, GEODE-3399\r\nThis allows the locator to respond to Protobuf requests. Currently it\r\nwill only be able to respond to getAvailableServers.\r\n\r\nTo enable this we are introducing a new value of \"0\" that will be sent\r\nin place of the Gossip version. After it we expect the same magic byte\r\n(\"110\") as in AcceptorImpl.\r\n\r\nThis also is gated by the `geode.feature-protobuf-protocol` system\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe getAvailableServers request handler now uses the locator directly,\r\nsince we are on the locator.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Brian Rowe <browe@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [✔️ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the JIRA ticket here.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-3337)\r\n\r\n`LauncherLifecycleCommandsDUnitTest` was a huge test class that tested multiple commands, in addition to using the deprecated `CliCommandsTestBase`. These tests have been refactored to use more up-to-date test rules and also separated into test classes based on the command that they test.\r\n\r\nSome tests in the original `LauncherLifecycleCommandsDUnitTest` seemed to be unnecessary or redundant (for example, `StatusLocatorRealGfshTest` already tested some of the tests in `LauncherLifecycleCommandsDUnitTest`) so these were deleted.\r\n\r\n**Testing Status: Precheckin all green!**\r\n\r\n- [x] JIRA ticket\r\n\r\n- [x] Rebased\r\n\r\n- [x] Single commit\r\n\r\n- [x] `gradlew build` runs cleanly\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests
