Updated TVMScript syntax of `T.allocate` to return buffer var.\r\n* Added syntax sugar for `T.decl_buffer`. When `data` field is not specified, `data` will be implicitly created via `Allocate` stmt.\r\n* Updated the existing test cases. Most test cases can be updated by changing `T.allocate` to `T.decl_buffer`. `T.allocate` in some tests are updated to `T.allocate` + `T.buffer_decl`, to maintain the legacy behavior of allocation and implicit buffer declaration (will be followed up in future PR to adopt `T.decl_buffer`).\r\n\r\nRelated RFC: https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/87\r\n\r\ncc @junrushao1994 @Lunderberg

adds asynchronous DMA support through the Hexagon User DMA engine with unit tests to validate basic functionality.  Asynchronous DMA support here means the ability to \"kick off\" asynchronously a number of DMAs using the `Copy` API and then to `Poll` for or `Wait` on a number of \"in flight\" (not done) DMAs.  Enables future testing and development for asynchronous memory copy on Hexagon.  For now, Hexagon DMA support remains synchronous in nature through existing `hexagon_user_dma_1d_sync` interface which uses asynchronous capable `HexagonUserDMA` class in a synchronous way --- calling `Copy` and `Wait` back to back for each request.\n\ncc

goals for this PR are the following:\r\n\r\n1. E2E compilation should work without QNN canonicalization on the Hexagon target.\r\n2. Enable int8 -> int8 computation for dense/conv2d operation.\r\n\r\nWhat was done:\r\n\r\n1. Disabled qnn::Legalize for Hexagon target. For other targets QNN passes keep working. By default QNN legalize and QNN canonicalize are enabled, but it can be disabled through the pass config. Example:\r\n```\r\n    # Disable QNN legalization and canonicalization passes\r\n    with tvm.transform.PassContext(opt_level=3, disabled_pass=[\"qnn.Legalize\"]):\r\n        mod, _ = relay.optimize(mod, tvm.target.Target(target_hexagon, host=target_hexagon))\r\n```\r\n2. Implemented new strategies (compute and schedules) for QNN ops. This is POC code. There was no goal to implement high performance compute/schedule functions. This will be done in future.\r\n3. To enable int8 -> int8 computation for dense/conv2d operation we need to merge dense|conv2d + [bias]! + requantize.\r\nThere are two ways how to implement this:\r\nA) Implement new IRModule -> IRModule pass that will pattern match combination conv2d+requantize/conv2d+bias+requantize and etc.\r\nB) Change TECompiler and lower sequence of QNN operation into one TOPI op.\r\nPossibly, A) is more natural but A) implies adding dozens of new Relay ops which only make sense for Hexagon target, not genetic and overloaded with a huge number of arguments (inputs, quantization parameters, bias, requantization parameters etc.)\r\nThat's why B) approach was implemented in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc

for contributing to TVM!   Please refer to guideline https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/ for useful information and tips. After the pull request is submitted, please request code reviews from [Reviewers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md#reviewers) by @ them in the pull request thread.\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\nCreating more threads than there are HVX units causes performance degradation when threads are unable to reserve an HVX unit and end up running vector instructions on the Scalar cores. Capping the max number of threads to be the number of available HVX units on the device prevents this from occurring and results in better performance on hexagon. \r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nRan tests in simulator mode as well on a hexagon HDK to ensure that the expected result of locking max_concurrency to 4 was achieved.

PR adds heap-size to the microTVM project options. So far the heap size has been fixed (216KB) for all boards. Exposing it as a project option allows the user to modify the value based on each specific board's available memory.\r\nA \"recommended_heap_size\" is added for the \"stm32l4r5zi\" in \"boards.json\". The recommended value is tested on 4 boards (10 times on each board) and the result is compared against the default value of 216KB. The average failure rate has remained almost constant for all boards.\r\n\r\ncc @gromero , @mehrdadh , @alanmacd , @areusch

C5 and C5d 12xlarge, 24xlarge, and metal instances feature custom 2nd generation [Intel](https://aws.amazon.com/intel/) Xeon Scalable Processors (Cascade Lake) with a sustained all-core turbo frequency of 3.6GHz and maximum single core turbo frequency of 3.9GHz. The other C5 and C5d instance sizes will either launch on the 2nd generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processor or the 1st generation Intel Xeon Platinum 8000 series (Skylake-SP) processor with a sustained all core Turbo frequency of up to 3.4GHz, and single core turbo up to 3.5 GHz using Intel Turbo Boost Technology.\r\n\r\n>The C5 and C5d 12xlarge, 24xlarge, and metal instance sizes enable Vector Neural Network Instructions (AVX-512 VNNI*) which will help speed up typical machine learning operations like convolution, and automatically improve inference performance over a wide range of deep learning workloads.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to [introduction to AWS EC2 C5 targets](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c5/), the C5 12x and 24x machine are `cascade lake` architecture instead of `skylake`, and enable Vector Neural Network Instructions (AVX-512 VNNI*) which can be useful for AutoTensorization.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the target definition of the 2 above mentioned C5 machine to support VNNI.\r\n\r\nCC

adds a lint step that checks the PR title and body with some of the basic checks from https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/88. This makes it so we can enforce the decided rules without having to rely on automated fix-ups, though for certain things those would be ideal in the future. The rules implemented here are not complete as the RFC is not fully merged but this is just supposed to be a starting point with some of the basic rules, namely that a title and body should be present. A follow up PR will enforce that there are no @ tags once #12637 is resolved.\r\n\r\ncc @Mousius @areusch @gigiblender @gromero @leandron

allocations were being moved inside loops even if they were originally allocated outside of the loops. Normally PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation moves allocations as close to use as possible and then StorageRewrite moves them back out as far as possible. However, with Vtcm allocation, PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation would move the Vtcm allocation close to the compute, then LowerVtcm would convert the allocation to a LetStmt. StorageRewrite would not move this LetStmt as it only handles allocations. Moving LowerVtcmAlloc to after StorageRewrite ensures that the vtcm allocations are in their final spot before converting them to a LetStmt.\r\n\r\n@csullivan @Lunderberg

fixes the issue where merging from GitHub Actions (i.e. with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`) doesn't trigger post merge GitHub Actions on the commit it creates in `main`. Instead these jobs are triggered manually by a call to the Actions API after the merge has taken place.\r\n\r\nThis also updates the tvmbot testing code (and by extension some of the other CI testing code) to remove the fixtures for each test in favor of constructing them from a single sample at runtime, this makes it a lot easier to add new tests and see what is different between each data sample and clean up the testing anti-patterns that were there before (e.g. `run()` instead of `pytest.mark.parameterize`, but none of the tests in `test_ci.py` have changed)\r\n\r\nTested in

goals for this PR are the following:\r\n\r\n1. E2E compilation should work without QNN canonicalization on the Hexagon target.\r\n2. Enable int8 -> int8 computation for dense/conv2d operation.\r\n\r\nWhat was done:\r\n1. Disabled qnn::Legalize for Hexagon target. For other targets QNN passes keep working.\r\n2. Implemented new strategies (compute and schedules) for QNN ops. This is POC code. There was no goal to implement high performance compute/schedule functions. This will be done in future.\r\n3. To enable int8 -> int8 computation for dense/conv2d operation we need to merge dense|conv2d + [bias]! + requantize.\r\nThere are two ways how to implement this:\r\nA) Implement new IRModule -> IRModule pass that will pattern match combination conv2d+requantize/conv2d+bias+requantize and etc.\r\nB) Change TECompiler and lower sequence of QNN operation into one TOPI op.\r\nPossibly, A) is more natural but A) implies adding dozens of new Relay ops which only make sense for Hexagon target, not genetic and overloaded with a huge number of arguments (inputs, quantization parameters, bias, requantization parameters etc.)\r\nThat's why B) approach was implemented in this PR.\r\n\n\ncc

PR extends `PostOrderApply` to allow passing in a function that filters which blocks have schedules generated. Although this could be used in many ways, I implement one example where blocks are filtered by name. This can be useful for hand optimizing part of a primfunc, and using metaschedule to tune other parts. I've added a new `Blocks` argument to `tune_tir` that allows users to optionally specify the names of blocks that should be tuned. If not provided, the behavior of `tune_tir` is exactly the same as before this PR.","created_at":"2022-08-08T23:58:32Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:57:20Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T21:44:27Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T21:44:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"aea82c64178cbdb458dcc031bc7a88a10d9f742a","assignee":{"login":"zxybazh","id":3203174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDMxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh","html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zxybazh","id":3203174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDMxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh","html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12342/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12342/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12342/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/90f648032ede790133dc18c39176e2742e763cdc","head":{"label":"jwfromm:tune_block","ref":"tune_block","sha":"90f648032ede790133dc18c39176e2742e763cdc","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

PR does the following:\r\n- When running on a shard,  removes the tests that will not run on the current shard from the suite. We'll no longer get the message `Test running on shard X of Y` in the XML reports. This will result in cleaner test reports.\r\n- Adds the shard index or `no-shard` to the generated XML report file name. Currently, the reports generated when sharding is present are overwritten in S3 by the last shard to finish in the CI pipeline. This change is needed as part of #11670.\r\n- Since the same tests might run on different configurations (CPU, GPU), it uploads the result of each configuration in a subdirectory in S3 (e.g `/pytest-results/frontend_aarch64`).\r\n\r\ncc @Mousius @areusch

PR is aim to change floating point multiplication of resize operator to integer division when `method` is nearest_neighbor and `coordinate_transformation_mode` is asymmetric.\r\n\r\n**Why this change?**  \r\n\r\nWhen using `create_prim_func` to convert topi.upsampling into primfunc, tir analyzer cannot parse complex floating point operations in tir block body. In the following case, the dimensions of read buffer are inferred as 0 : 128. We expect to be `tir.reads([x[i0_1, i1_1, i2_1/scale_h, i3_1/scale_w]])`in line 18，so it can perform compute_at schedule on this prim_func.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nscale_h = 2\r\nscale_w = 2\r\nx = te.placeholder([1, 128, 128, 128], \"int8\", \"x\")\r\ny = topi.nn.upsampling(x, scale_h , scale_w)\r\nfunc = te.create_prim_func([x, y])\r\nprint(func)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nprimfn(var_x: handle, var_resize: handle) -> ()\r\n  attr = {\"global_symbol\": \"main\", \"tir.noalias\": True}\r\n  buffers = {x: Buffer(x_1: Pointer(global int8), int8, [1, 128, 128, 128], []),\r\n             resize: Buffer(resize_1: Pointer(global int8), int8, [1, 128, 256, 256], [])}\r\n  buffer_map = {var_x: x, var_resize: resize} {\r\n  block([], \"root\") {\r\n    tir.reads([])\r\n    tir.writes([])\r\n    for (i0: int32, 0, 1) {\r\n      for (i1: int32, 0, 128) {\r\n        for (i2: int32, 0, 256) {\r\n          for (i3: int32, 0, 256) {\r\n            block([1, 128, 256, 256], \"resize\") as [i0_1, i1_1, i2_1, i3_1] {\r\n              bind(i0_1, i0)\r\n              bind(i1_1, i1)\r\n              bind(i2_1, i2)\r\n              bind(i3_1, i3)\r\n              tir.reads([x[i0_1, i1_1, 0:128, 0:128]])\r\n              tir.writes([resize[i0_1, i1_1, i2_1, i3_1]])\r\n              resize[i0_1, i1_1, i2_1, i3_1] = cast(int8, cast(float32, x[i0_1, i1_1, max(min(cast(int32, @tir.floor(((0.5f32*cast(float32, i2_1)) + 1e-05f32), dtype=float32)), 127), 0), max(min(cast(int32, @tir.floor(((0.5f32*cast(float32, i3_1)) + 1e-05f32), dtype=float32)), 127), 0)]))\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Why can it be changed?** \r\n\r\nThis PR only modify float multiplication to integer division when `method`  is `nearest_neighbor` and `coordinate_transformation_mode` is `asymmetric`(it's default setting for topi.upsampling op).\r\n\r\nGo further, we expect to convert $\\lfloor s * x + \\epsilon_1 \\rfloor$ to $x//a$, $s$ is scale, a float number, $x$ is input, $\\epsilon_1$ is 1e-5 in resize op, $a$ is the reciprocal of $s$, an integer.\r\n\r\n So, we can represent output as this: \r\n$y = \\lfloor s * x + \\epsilon_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor ( \\frac{1}{a} + \\epsilon_0 ) * x + \\epsilon_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{x}{a} + \\epsilon_0 * x + \\epsilon_1 \\rfloor$, let $x = a * m + n$, where $m = x // a, n = x \\% a$ , then we can get $y = m + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{a} + \\epsilon_0 * x + \\epsilon_1 \\rfloor$. In the case of upsampling op, $x$ and $a$ are always integers, so inequality $\\frac{n}{a} \\le \\frac{a-1}{a}$ always holds. If $\\epsilon_0 * x + \\epsilon_1 < \\frac{1}{a}$, we can get $0 < \\frac{n}{a} + \\epsilon_0 * x + \\epsilon_1 < 1$，then $y = m + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{a} + \\epsilon_0 * x + \\epsilon_1 \\rfloor = m = x // a$.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, when $\\epsilon_0 * x + \\epsilon_1 < \\frac{1}{a}$, we can get $y = \\lfloor s*x + \\epsilon_1 \\rfloor = x // a$.\r\n\r\nIn this PR,  we assume $\\epsilon_0 = \\epsilon_1 = 1e-5$ and `can_convert_multiply_to_intdiv`to check $\\epsilon_0 * x + \\epsilon_1 <

[relay.Expr,](https://github.com/blackkker/Pic-host/blob/main/%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_20220805112837.png) `_dyn_make.reshape` is called. Under normal circumstances, `_dyn_make.reshape`  will not be a problem, but it work incorrcetly in these case.\r\nSo i infer the value of shape expr to avoid dynamic.
