this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nProgress reporting should happen on a separate thread than worker thread to avoid delay in reporting

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @aljoscha @jasonkuster

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nA FnService is a closeable BindableService. A FnServer is exactly one\r\nFnService and a server which exposes it as an

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-06T23:34:08Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T16:37:52Z","closed_at":"2017-11-07T16:37:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da3120313954294e0a560708a5089b19c8e8b940","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f3b5d9502b342309e844d44c1e44f6704edb1c9e","head":{"label":"tgroh:ban_sdk_dependencies_in_fn_execution","ref":"ban_sdk_dependencies_in_fn_execution","sha":"f3b5d9502b342309e844d44c1e44f6704edb1c9e","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-06T22:23:28Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T05:26:39Z","closed_at":"2017-11-07T05:26:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa53d1e4a0dc8a1e980b3cb3f539bb79eb7055fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/cb82485422c489e729969a288c0fc946a1b67573","head":{"label":"wcn3:bigtableio_fix","ref":"bigtableio_fix","sha":"cb82485422c489e729969a288c0fc946a1b67573","user":{"login":"wcn3","id":4626810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjY4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4626810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3","html_url":"https://github.com/wcn3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109756517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDk3NTY1MTc=","name":"beam","full_name":"wcn3/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wcn3","id":4626810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjY4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4626810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3","html_url":"https://github.com/wcn3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcn3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wcn3/beam","description":"Mirror

is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n[sdk_worker](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/a33c717dbb9b25485218b135a78b5cdb3f8239c9/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/worker/sdk_worker.py#L30) is importing [futures](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures) module without declaring it in[ setup.py](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/a33c717dbb9b25485218b135a78b5cdb3f8239c9/sdks/python/setup.py#L97)\r\nAdding the direct dependency to futures to fix the dependencies of python sdk.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-31T20:47:47Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T15:55:17Z","closed_at":"2017-11-07T15:55:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb93a1e26d324ae583f38efb85958b7818584842","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4065/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4065/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4065/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/172970ba23b9a9c19f09e03fbf0db1d4ca60819e","head":{"label":"akedin:timestamp_diff","ref":"timestamp_diff","sha":"172970ba23b9a9c19f09e03fbf0db1d4ca60819e","user":{"login":"akedin","id":33067037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDY3MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin","html_url":"https://github.com/akedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108159679,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDgxNTk2Nzk=","name":"beam","full_name":"akedin/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akedin","id":33067037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDY3MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33067037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin","html_url":"https://github.com/akedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akedin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akedin/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-31T08:52:41Z","updated_at":"2017-12-19T22:53:11Z","closed_at":"2017-12-19T22:53:11Z","merged_at":"2017-12-19T22:53:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c81b41ff53ab890fd0c4d31d6fa1b157d9c0d81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4064/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4064/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/54434061478f053144c8c1e7156a187751f0bf82","head":{"label":"chamikaramj:sdf_direct_runner_3","ref":"sdf_direct_runner_3","sha":"54434061478f053144c8c1e7156a187751f0bf82","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61584074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTU4NDA3NA==","name":"beam","full_name":"chamikaramj/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nNow that ES 6.0.RC1 is out, it is time to upgrade deps to the latest 5.x\r\n@iemejia

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-27T00:02:37Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T15:57:22Z","closed_at":"2017-10-27T00:02:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e906d4a8785bdb889f8590413d2a320b633510c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4046/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4046/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4046/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/b11b30bd36d028f3cf659b0cb33bdc43eabba4f3","head":{"label":"lukecwik:jenkins2","ref":"jenkins2","sha":"b11b30bd36d028f3cf659b0cb33bdc43eabba4f3","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52895685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjg5NTY4NQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"lukecwik/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nDoing so with this pattern breaks the clients, as the shade plugin will\r\nrewrite the gRPC method name as well, which servers do

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

started this PR as an initial attempt to implement the BeamSQL `create table` statement.  The implementation might not be so mature, but I hope this could be a place we can discuss deeper about the create table. I will introduce this PR in the following 3 aspects:\r\n\r\n* MetaStore\r\n* TableProvider\r\n* Grammar\r\n\r\n## MetaStore\r\n\r\nMetastore is responsible for handling the CRUD of table during a session. e.g. create a table, query all tables, query a table by the specified name etc. When a table is created, the table meta info can be persisted by the metastore, but the default `InMemoryMetaStore` will only store the meta info in memory, so it will NOT be persisted, but user can implement the `MetaStore` interface to make a persistent implementation.\r\n\r\nThe table names in MetaStore need to be unique.\r\n\r\n## TableProvider\r\n\r\nThe tables in MetaStore can come from many different sources, the construction of a usable table is the responsibility of a `TableProvider`, TableProvider have the similar interface like `MetaStore`, but it only handles a specific type of table, e.g. `TextTableProvider` only handle text tables, while `KafakaTableProvider` only handle kafka tables.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, only `TextTableProvider`  and  `KafakaTableProvider` are implemented as example.\r\n\r\n## Grammar\r\n\r\nThe grammar for create a TEXT table is:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE ORDERS(\r\n   ID INT PRIMARY KEY COMMENT 'this is the primary key',\r\n   NAME VARCHAR(127) COMMENT 'this is the name'\r\n)\r\nTYPE 'text'\r\nCOMMENT 'this is the table orders'\r\nLOCATION 'text://home/admin/orders'\r\nTBLPROPERTIES '{\"format\": \"Excel\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n`LOCATION` dictates where the data of the table is stored. The scheme of the LOCATION dictate the table type, e.g. in the above example, the table type is `text`, using the table type we can find the corresponding `TextTableProvider` using the ServiceLoader merchanism.\r\n\r\n`TBLPROPERTIES` is used to specify some other properties of the table, in the above example, we specified the format of each line of text file: `Excel`(one variant of CSV format).\r\n\r\nThe grammar for create a KAFKA table is:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n CREATE TABLE ORDERS(\r\n   ID INT PRIMARY KEY COMMENT 'this is the primary key',\r\n   NAME VARCHAR(127) COMMENT 'this is the name'\r\n )\r\nTYPE 'kafka'\r\n COMMENT 'this is the table orders'\r\n LOCATION 'kafka://localhost:2181/brokers?topic=test'\r\n TBLPROPERTIES '{\"bootstrap.servers\":\"localhost:9092\", \"topics\": [\"topic1\",

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI did not do a sufficient offline verification during our Jenkins issues. Confirmed that findbugs fails on `master` and succeeds after this

The postcommit is currently timing out when it is\r\nbelieved to be OK.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @jkff \r\n\r\nAlso fixes a couple things masked by Jenkins outage.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA fix to a Java 9 build error caused by AutoValue was fixed in version 1.5.1.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a hack to allow the seed job to repair itself first, prior to seeding other jobs. There are better ways to establish this, but this one involves a minimally invasive change. After getting the job to run, I will close this

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial doc change that tripped me up.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nIntegration tests consume a significant amount of time, and are easily\r\nseparable from the remaining tests.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-20T23:31:44Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T00:19:23Z","closed_at":"2017-11-02T00:19:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a11e4bd137f3503ad7d319da64ac9ffe4cf8e09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/59900e5bcb90f0c807c9e55c67c27719afc5dfdb","head":{"label":"tgroh:split_integration_and_unit_tests","ref":"split_integration_and_unit_tests","sha":"59900e5bcb90f0c807c9e55c67c27719afc5dfdb","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @jkff since you mentioned the time findbugs spent, I thought I would try to get more value out of it anyhow.\r\n\r\nI have wondered for a while why `@Nullable` annotations didn't take care of themselves, since this is maybe the most important thing findbugs ought to be gaining us. Turns out it is simply turned off by default. It has to be turned on per-package, as far as I can tell. That is just as well, because some packages are in better shape than others.\r\n\r\nI addressed some low-hanging fruit to demonstrate, and the changes I made were universally improvements IMO, so that's nice evidence in favor of taking this further.","created_at":"2017-10-20T03:30:41Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T22:17:29Z","closed_at":"2017-10-20T22:01:16Z","merged_at":"2017-10-20T22:01:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1311d40a443b385d82ad34a9f6057f8ede52c36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4021/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4021/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4021/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/a1311d40a443b385d82ad34a9f6057f8ede52c36","head":{"label":"kennknowles:NonNull-by-default","ref":"NonNull-by-default","sha":"a1311d40a443b385d82ad34a9f6057f8ede52c36","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

That PR added a standalone seed job that would continue to work even if I screwed up the main seed job. But if I understand correctly, the \"standalone seed job\" does not have permissions to create new jobs. I didn't realize this at the time, but either way my plan would be mostly unchanged. The standalone job did succeed, so it has the power to restore existing jobs if not to create new ones.\r\n\r\nThis switches the main seed job to have the same contents, leaving the standalone job as a backup so we can restore easily.\r\n\r\nThe end goal is this: we \"never\" touch the seed job again, and no tweaking of other jobs can affect it. Then we can start to improve them safely.","created_at":"2017-10-19T23:00:47Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T22:16:38Z","closed_at":"2017-10-23T22:12:34Z","merged_at":"2017-10-23T22:12:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"073601b019a99e16a0eec5a4a07209c3a876e77d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/073601b019a99e16a0eec5a4a07209c3a876e77d","head":{"label":"kennknowles:seed-job-swap","ref":"seed-job-swap","sha":"073601b019a99e16a0eec5a4a07209c3a876e77d","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @jkff or @tgroh \r\n\r\nSuperficial issue: misuse of generated proto code. This is an obviously-correct fix that gets things green in the short term. I've confirmed this fix eliminates the NPE currently happening on `SplittableDoFnTest` in the Dataflow postcommit.\r\n\r\nLarger issue: we stage a portable pipeline and the Dataflow job description has (or will have) pointers into that portable pipeline for the runner harness to extract portable payloads. So setting up `ProcessKeyedElements` to have a `null` payload or to be `NotSerializable` is incorrect. Instead, I think it has to be a standardized transform with a portable URN/payload specification. That will be a prerequisite to supporting SDF portably, unless we have a different implementation strategy.","created_at":"2017-10-19T19:51:02Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T22:18:02Z","closed_at":"2017-10-19T21:55:55Z","merged_at":"2017-10-19T21:55:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"d879d2791e51dee5baddbdbe51f757e44b55a109","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/d879d2791e51dee5baddbdbe51f757e44b55a109","head":{"label":"kennknowles:SplittableParDo-portability","ref":"SplittableParDo-portability","sha":"d879d2791e51dee5baddbdbe51f757e44b55a109","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @tgroh I think you'll see what I did wrong

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm entertaining name changes on the options interfaces or any suggestions on how to make it easier to migrate from

been agreed upon.\r\n\r\nReview notes:\r\n* I dropped the \"helpers\" in PCollectionViewTesting that weren't very useful.\r\n* I also migrated off of tests calling PCollectionViews directly and instead constructing them through pc.apply(View.asYYY()) to simplify maintenance since PCollectionViews is internal only view View.asYYY is public.\r\n* I tried to migrate uses of `PCollectionView.getCoderInternal()`/`PCollection.getWindowingStrategyInternal()`/... to `PCollectionView.getPCollection().getYYY()` but was unable to because the PCollection stored within PCollectionView is transient and the majority of runners pull information from serialized PCollectionViews, not from proto round tripped views.\r\n* I loosened the types on PCollectionView so that they weren't so \"Iterable\" materialization focused.\r\n* I thought of creating a MultimapPCollectionView or something like that which narrowed the types of PCollectionView so it was easier to use PCollectionView instead of all the `?` types and forced casts but that would have grown this PR to be so much larger.","created_at":"2017-10-18T21:40:57Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T17:00:59Z","closed_at":"2017-11-15T17:00:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6dcda8fca770d6858eb073750c3c6867d4924b3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/341521a04cbb41e1d90463eeb6bdb185d6a43365","head":{"label":"lukecwik:side_input","ref":"side_input","sha":"341521a04cbb41e1d90463eeb6bdb185d6a43365","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52895685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjg5NTY4NQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"lukecwik/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @jasonkuster

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @herohde \r\n\r\nVerified that everything in the shaded jar begins with `org.apache.beam.fn.harness` which is the current

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe state machines for the variants of `AfterWatermark.pastEndOfWindow()` were inconsistent in when they set a timer or not. Since this state machine should be decoupled from whatever context it is being run in, it should set a timer for the time it is interested in.\r\n\r\nThis is deliberately peeled off #3988 since it is simpler and more definitely correct. The other bits in that PR are under further revision.\r\n\r\nR: @bjchambers

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-16T21:56:35Z","updated_at":"2017-10-17T00:14:24Z","closed_at":"2017-10-17T00:14:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cdd0e98800690162d8dd436d893614c1af043110","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/0d8626e5a0c99420535375a2162e22e60eeb28df","head":{"label":"lukecwik:beam3063","ref":"beam3063","sha":"0d8626e5a0c99420535375a2162e22e60eeb28df","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52895685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjg5NTY4NQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"lukecwik/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

this commit to 2.2.0 release branch.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-16T21:02:08Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T19:48:02Z","closed_at":"2017-10-18T19:48:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1573181c5efea90d98b96aadff1f655a474c0c7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/25cab6be8d763a03d2a37f0647698cba79df6ac5","head":{"label":"chamikaramj:bigtable_read_it_fix_cerrypick","ref":"bigtable_read_it_fix_cerrypick","sha":"25cab6be8d763a03d2a37f0647698cba79df6ac5","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61584074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTU4NDA3NA==","name":"beam","full_name":"chamikaramj/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis adds support for \"done\" notification in `BigtableIO.write()`.  For each bundle that is completely written, a single \"Void\" is output by the PTransform.  Doing so allows flows to effectively wait for all writes to finish.\r\n\r\nThis works well for batch flows (and I've been using for a few weeks now in some large ones), but there is some limitation on the streaming side.\r\n\r\nFor streaming writes, all \"done\" notifications are output into the global window, rather than the window(s?) that was(were) written in that bundle.  I'm not very familiar with the interactions of bundles, windows, and panes in the streaming API, so I haven't tried to solve this at all, although for this IO specifically it seems doable.","created_at":"2017-10-16T15:04:37Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T23:58:55Z","closed_at":"2018-05-08T20:31:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"76cdafa5098f60f8cceacd1ffae4770eb1013b56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/b6848d54c4eac2942abed6ce363aaa5ae3f2ba05","head":{"label":"tc-dc:bigtable-done-notification","ref":"bigtable-done-notification","sha":"b6848d54c4eac2942abed6ce363aaa5ae3f2ba05","user":{"login":"tc-dc","id":23220554,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIzMjIwNTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23220554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc","html_url":"https://github.com/tc-dc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90903122,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDkwMzEyMg==","name":"beam","full_name":"tc-dc/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tc-dc","id":23220554,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIzMjIwNTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23220554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc","html_url":"https://github.com/tc-dc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tc-dc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tc-dc/beam","description":"Mirror
