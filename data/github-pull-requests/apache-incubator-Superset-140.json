Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR implements cache invalidation for charts (after https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7032), in two places:\r\n\r\n(1) In the frontend, every time a `POST` is done by `SupersetClient` to get chart data, we invalidate the cache. This happens when the user clicks \"force refresh\" in a dashboard, or clicks \"run query\" in the explore view. When this happens, we extract the chart id (`slice_id`) and **delete all stored responses that reference that chart** ‚Äî this would include, eg, a cached response of the chart with extra filters from a dashboard.\r\n\r\n(2) In the backend, we use a similar strategy. Unfortunately, we can't iterate over all the cached keys like in the frontend, to find all related cached responses. So we compute the key that would be generated **if a `GET` request was made**, and invalidate it.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI've tested manually, by modifying charts and ensuring that dashboards refresh correctly:\r\n\r\n1. Create chart in explore view, browser does a `POST` request.\r\n2. Reload chart, browser does `GET` and caches the response.\r\n3. Reload chart, browser reuses cached response.\r\n4. Reload chart after cache expiration, browser does conditional response.\r\n5. Click \"Run Query\". Browser does a `POST`, cache is invalidated for that chart. Server-side cache is also invalidated.\r\n\r\nSimilarly for dashboards. Before, if you clicked force refresh on a dashboard it would performa a `POST` and show the new data. But reloading the dashboard would show the old charts, since they were still cached in the browser.\r\n\r\nI tried adding Cypress integration tests, but for some reason I get an error when writing to the Cache API (it works fine in Chrome) from an integration test:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nTypeError: Failed to execute 'put' on 'Cache': parameter 2 is not of type 'Response'.\r\n    at eval (webpack-internal:///./node_modules/@superset-ui/connection/esm/callApi/callApi.js:17)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

example data sets,\r\nSuperset used to load from the local package. This created a few issues\r\nnotably around licensing (what are these datasets licensed as?) and\r\naround package size.\r\n\r\nFor now, I moved the data sets here https://github.com/apache-superset/examples-data\r\nand altered the logic to download the data from where it is stored (another Github repo).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe following query cannot be parsed by `sqlparse`, even though it's valid:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWITH\r\n    columns AS (SELECT metric FROM a),\r\n    rows AS (SELECT metric FROM b)\r\nSELECT\r\n    c.metric AS m1,\r\n    r.metric AS m2\r\nFROM columns c\r\nJOIN rows r\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because `sqlparse` treats `rows` as a reserved word, even though the query is valid in Presto.\r\n\r\nOur users have been overcoming the problem by quoting `rows`. This prevents `sqlparse` from treating it as a reserved word. But it's confusing to users, because the underlying engine (Presto) doesn't require it.\r\n\r\nInstead, I fixed it by following [Postel's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle), and being liberal about user input.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify

Cannot create a time series table\r\n2. Cannot save a time series table\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we pass and save all props as state properties in the TimeSeriesColumnControl. When we make a backend request, we pass all the state properties as form data. Some of these properties do not make sense (i.e. a function to render the tooltip) and thus the request fails. \r\n\r\nThe fix is to be explicit about the state properties so that we only pass back relevant and comprehensible properties to the backend.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch This addresses some of the issues you were trying to fix in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6959. I think we should be explicit in our state properties versus adding the prop passthroughProps.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nTested

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Add unit tests\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSchema and table names that contain special characters currently cause the following problems:\r\n- SQL Lab: If schema contains slashes, browsing tables doesn't work. This is due to the schema being passed unquoted in the path of the AJAX call, causing it to add a new component to the path.\r\n- SQL Lab: if table contains slashes, preview of the table doesn't always work for similar reasons as the schema. This has been worked around by using the `path:`-prefix for table name; however, `path:` can't be used if there are multiple components in the path containing slashes.\r\n- Engine specs: Snowflake, Presto, Hive and MySQL currently pass the selected schema unquoted to the connection URI, most likely causing all queries to fail if schema contains slashes.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds quoting to schema and table names that are passed in the URI path, and ensures that unquoting is performed in the receiving end. Quoting is done by calling `encodeURIComponent()` first on the schema/table name, and finally calling `encodeURI()` on the full URI. Both calls are required, as only encoding the table/schema component will be converted to a regular slash by most (all?) webservers. In addition, a typo was fixed in the `TableSelector` `onChange()` event, and the utils function `js_string_to_python` was refactored to be more descriptive and generic.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n<img width=\"704\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-15 at 16 10 54\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/56135299-16489000-5f99-11e9-9596-b74f79e689ab.png\">\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n<img width=\"791\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-15 at 12 55 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/56135236-f3b67700-5f98-11e9-9712-5e7f96b98256.png\">\r\n<img width=\"894\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-05-07 at 8 05 26\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/57273150-5504ce00-709f-11e9-8c31-e4e23153ecb0.png\">\r\n<img width=\"896\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-05-07 at 8 04 49\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/57273153-58985500-709f-11e9-826a-a7e09dbac8ef.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested locally to work both with and without slashes in table and schema names.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIf a dashboard has a color mapping saved and the user explores a chart from the dashboard, the coloring may look different. This is because we would propagate the color scheme but not the color mapping to the chart. This change fixes this issue. The PR also sets it up for color consistency in charts and the ability to change an individual color mapping in the future.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWith the new chart cache, when we first load the Explore view we perform a `GET` request, to quickly load a cached response (if any). When the user clicks \"Run Query\", the request is  `POST`ed to `explore_json`, bypassing the response cache but still using the data frame cache in `viz.py`.\r\n\r\nOne problem with this is that if the user modifies the visualization, saves and reloads the page, they will see the old visualization, because of the browser cache.\r\n\r\nWe can use the [Application Cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache) mechanism to fix that, but it would require keeping a list of cached and invalidated resources. For now, I'd rather just turn off the `GET` requests in the Explore view.\r\n\r\nSince we're turning off `GET` requests in Explore view, we can also revert https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7255.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn the deck.gl legend we round down the values so they look nice. Depending on the metric, this makes the maximum value be outside the range of the last bucket, eg, if:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmin = 8.4\r\nmax = 27.1\r\nbuckets = 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe buckets will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n8-12\r\n12-16\r\n16-20\r\n20-23\r\n23-27\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd `27.1` will fall outside the buckets. This PR adds an extra bucket in cases like this.\r\n\r\n<!-- ##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps were taken to verify -->\r\n\r\nTested with data, an extra bucket `27-31` gets created.\r\n\r\nAlso tested with values that are identical to the upper range of the last bucket. In that case no extra bucket gets created.\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\ndb migration in #6945 was based on an older head. I run `superset db merge heads` to make it compatible with master, but when we run `superset db upgrade`, somehow downgrade script from #6945 is not triggered.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nNow I rebased migration script to latest master to make sure revision is from latest master. So downgrade script will be executed.\r\n\r\n##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\nrun `superset db upgrade` should see extra parents attribute in layout meta data.\r\nrun `superset db downgrade` should see parents attribute are removed.\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nDeck gl scales the x and y axis based on the bounds we pass it. The scaling involves dividing a target size by the range. But since the range is 0 for a single point, we throw an error if our data is a single coordinate. This change will check if we have a single coordinate. If so, then the bounds we pass to deck gl will be the point's coordinates with padding.\r\n\r\n##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1211\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-09 at 2 53 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/55838068-0c75e700-5ad8-11e9-9829-3588d5a1eec8.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1375\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-09 at 2 48 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/55838073-113a9b00-5ad8-11e9-84cc-da6840852437.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\nManual testing and unit tests.\r\n\r\nI tested manually with normal single points, boundary cases, and various viz types.

Reading the Presto docs, it's unclear to me if Presto supports this at all (cc: @nishantrayan).

It doesn't get saved, since it's not sent in the payload to `/superset/save_dash/`;\r\n2. Changing it won't trigger the `hasUnsavedChanges`, so the user might not save the change.\r\n\r\nI added the refresh frequency to the payload, and made it so that modifying the refresh frequency sets `hasUnsavedChanges` to true, prompting the user to save the dash.\r\n\r\nNote that in order to do the latter I changed the dropdown to only show the option when the user is in edit mode. This can be changed, but I'm worried that users will not know the difference between setting the frequency without entering edit mode (it's not saved, and only applies to the current browser tab) vs. changing it in edit mode (it is saved and applies to all dashboards). Thoughts on this?\r\n\r\n<!-- ##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps were taken to verify -->\r\n\r\nCreated new dashboard, changed the refresh frequency. Value is present in the payload, saved in the DB. On next load, the initial value is correctly read from the DB.\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [X] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

This should fix all the weird problems that were happening with tags (new charts starting with tags, and wrong objects showing up in the tag search).\r\n\r\nFor the SQLAlchemy queries, I rewrote them to use explicit joins (to avoid accidents with cross joins), and also made the logic more clear.\r\n\r\n<!-- ##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps were taken to verify -->\r\n\r\nI created charts and dashboards, tagged them, and verified that everything is working as expected.\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

Right now query search lets anyone access any queries. That would be the default for all roles, but if a deployment wanted to change to restrict users to only search their queries they could do that with the can_only_access_owned_queries permission.\r\n\r\nWith can_only_access_owned_queries in OBJECT_SPEC_PERMISSIONS, this permission is not added to any role by default. \r\n\r\n##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\nRun superset init with new can_only_access_owned_queries default off in OBJECT_SPEC_PERMISSIONS\r\nLogged in as user1 and ran query\r\nLogged in as user2 and confirmed that I could see all queries queries in `/superset/sqllab#search` and `/queryview/list/`\r\nMoved perm can_only_access_owned_queries to ADMIN_ONLY_PERMISSIONS \r\nRun superset init\r\nConfirmed that as user2 I could see only my queries queries in `/superset/sqllab#search` and `/queryview/list/`\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

Many users feel confused whether charts under other tabs are affected by filter, or which charts are affected by filter. At the same time, if there are many charts in DOM, trigger queries for charts under other invisible tabs will make charts in current tab looks very slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**:\r\nAfter user updates a filter, trigger new queries when charts are visible.\r\n- If both filter and chart are visible (under same tab), new queries should be triggered right away.\r\n- If charts are not visible when filter is updated, chart will not be updated at the same time. But when user click into a new tab, all the charts become visible should trigger updated queries.\r\n\r\n**Implementation and Performance**:\r\n- Dashboard used `react-bootstrap TabContainer` as root level tab. To avoid expensive mounts/unmounts of the entire dashboard upon adding/removing top-level tabs, we set `unmountOnExit={false}`. This means it will **not** remove rendered charts from the DOM when they are no longer visible. And when charts data/state is updated, each chart will re-render itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n- old filter flow:\r\nUser update a filter, \r\n=> change filter state in redux\r\n=> Dashboard component pass down the changes to its children components\r\n=> in Dashboard `componentDidUpdate`: call runQuery async action creator for every chart, which will trigger a new query for every chart\r\n=> `dashboard/components/gridComponents/Chart.jsx` decide `shouldComponentUpdate`: only check if chart has valid props changes.\r\n=> after chart's state is updated, each chart will trigger its render function\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen dashboard calling runQuery for each chart, it doesn't check visibility of the charts. Since tab/charts visibility is stored in component state not global redux, dashboard component has no awareness of each chart visibility. It will send updated queries even when charts are not visible. This `update all charts together` solution has another lack for clearance: when user clicks another tab, the data is already updated, but there is no clear indicator to tell user when these charts are updated.\r\n\r\n- new filter flow:\r\nInstead of using `Dashboard` component to trigger query for each chart, new filter flow delegate the logic to component (react component props and redux state).\r\n   - `Chart` component: added `componentDidUpdate`. After any chart is mounted, if its query parameters are changed (from props), we should allow chart run updated query and re-render.\r\n   - Components in dashboard (row, column, tab, tabs, chartHolder): add `isComponentVisible` props. It passes visibility status from parents to it children component. \r\n\r\nUser update a filter, \r\n=> change filter state in redux\r\n=> Dashboard component pass down the changes to its children components\r\n=> in Dashboard component `componentDidUpdate`: set each chart's `triggerQuery` flag be true, which mean chart `should` be updated. Here we don't trigger query anymore.\r\n=> `dashboard/components/gridComponents/Chart.jsx` decide `shouldComponentUpdate`: besides valid props changes, chart only updates when it's visible.\r\n=> chart's props changes. In `componentDidUpdate`, if there were a filter update, chart will have `triggerQuery` flag set true. And chart's query parameters are also updated, it will trigger a new query and re-render after data come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![byqgGBmtqQ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/56014990-51527700-5cac-11e9-8d40-c8a23b22af29.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![SB32t0Cyx5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/56015085-9aa2c680-5cac-11e9-808d-92dfb35d207f.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. create dashboard with root level tabs and row level tabs. there should have a filter_box in dashboard.\r\n2. load dashboard, visit charts in different tabs. \r\n3. Change filter box value, you should see queries from charts in the same tab were sent to server-side.\r\n4. select another tab, you will see queries from current visible tabs were sent out.\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

unexpected, really bad behaviors around control validation:\r\n\r\n* when a chart opens in a state where a control is invalid, it still\r\n  runs the query, and sometimes gets stuck in what appears to be a 'running'\r\n  state. After this change, no query is run, and a warning is displayed\r\n  in the chart panel body, just like any other error would\r\n* validation used to be done in the <Control> component and alter the\r\n  redux store as it went. Clearly this is not the right approach, now\r\n  validation occurs on loading the initial redux state, as well as in\r\n  the reducer when controls are changed\r\n* currently, when going from a invalid control state to a valid one\r\n  (user addresses what is needed), it auto-triggers a query which can be\r\n  unexpected. After this change, the error message disappears, and the\r\n  \"Run Query\" overlay gets displayed\r\n* when changing viz type, it's common to get new validation\r\n  errors, and currently when that occurs it will still go ahead and run\r\n  a query with invalid inputs, which often results in errors\r\n  that are not well handled, since much of the logic\r\n  assumes control-validated input.\r\n*

messages\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-04T16:26:20Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:18:38Z","closed_at":"2019-04-18T18:36:39Z","merged_at":"2019-04-18T18:36:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"97718daea36765677ee3e79f66704a20e693e86c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"michellethomas","id":817955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/817955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas","html_url":"https://github.com/michellethomas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michellethomas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"graceguo-supercat","id":27990562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTkwNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27990562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat","html_url":"https://github.com/graceguo-supercat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/graceguo-supercat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":757538559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3NTc1Mzg1NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/lyft","name":"lyft","color":"ff00bf","default":false,"description":"Related

The dataframe cache is useful when the HTTP request is different but the generated SQL query is unaltered.\r\n\r\n<!-- ##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps were taken to verify -->\r\n\r\nTested the \"Misc Charts\" dashboard, saw cache working. I also ran a local server without any cache, and verified that it works.\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration. Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n    [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n    [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n    [ ] Fixes bug\r\n    [x] Refactors code\r\n    [ ] Adds

It measures the query time correctly but does not take into account the rendering time and so users feel like it is misleading. I have updated the timer to include rendering time.\r\n\r\nThere is still a problem where the timer pauses before it reflects the final time. This apparent when there are many rows of data to display. The UI is blocked as the main thread is dealing with these many rows of data. I think this will be addressed when we replace the viz types? For now, the final time is more accurate with this change.\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps were taken to verify -->\r\nTested manually\r\n\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

This is because we saved map style and other props as class variables once in the AnimatableDeckGLContainer constructor and never updated these properties even if the user changed things like the map style. Instead of referring to class variables, I explicitly list out the props and pass the props thru.\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps were taken to verify -->\r\nManually tested\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

Visualizations use `camelCase`, and the Python backend uses `snake_case`. There are a few exceptions: controls in the explore view still use `snake_case`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the filter box is a visualization that repurposes controls. So the visualization receives the payload in `camelCase`, passes it to the control, which fails to understand it.\r\n\r\nI fixed it by adding a function to convert from one style to the other. This is a temporary workaround, until we make everything more consistent.\r\n\r\n<!--- ##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps were taken to verify -->\r\nFilter boxes now work as expected. Before, it would fail to render time grains, and possibly other fields.\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

If the user specifies his or her own custom tooltips, we use those tooltips instead. Note that in geojson and path vizs, the user must specify the extra props. This isn't really that discoverable so we should perhaps think of improving that experience.\r\n\r\n##### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nArc Viz\r\n<img width=\"528\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-01 at 9 41 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/55377427-c31b0b80-54c9-11e9-8e8b-410197c46715.png\">\r\n\r\nGrid Viz\r\n<img width=\"503\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-01 at 9 43 57 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/55377497-0d03f180-54ca-11e9-89a5-71d636b28363.png\">\r\n\r\nHex Viz\r\n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-01 at 9 44 42 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/55377507-12f9d280-54ca-11e9-99f1-f66fe54cc4ac.png\">\r\n\r\nScatter Plot\r\n<img width=\"478\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-04-01 at 9 45 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/55377515-19884a00-54ca-11e9-9974-f1c15949c85e.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n##### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps were taken to verify -->\r\nManual testing\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration.

Selecting Don't add to dashboard => sessionStorage's key is removed => next time when launching the modal, the default option remains checked\r\n2. Selecting existing dashboard => sessionStorage's key is set => when launching the modal, appropriate dashboard is preselected (see gif above)\r\n3. Adding new dashboard => same scenario as above.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, made sure that the state is consistent, i.e. if user doesn't have access to a given dashboard ID anymore (e.g. it was deleted), preselecting doesn't happen.\r\n\r\n##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue --> \r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n    [x] Has associated issue: #5939\r\n    [ ] Changes UI\r\n    [ ] Requires DB Migration. Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n    [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n    [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n    [ ] Fixes bug\r\n    [x] Refactors code\r\n    [ ] Adds test(s)\r\n    [x] Fixes #5939 \r\n\r\nI had to refactor the test file a little bit - the `fetchDashboards` function was not bound properly and therefore tests were failing because I was calling `.then()` on the returned value. If there's a better way to solve this problem than what I came up with, please let me know.\r\n\r\n#####

came across a situation where `open(...)` threw a `UnicodeDecodeError` as the  `backendSync.json` file now contains non ascii characters [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/assets/backendSync.json#L1189-L1190) (which was introduced in v0.31), i.e.,\r\n```\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/superset/__init__.py\", line 48, in <module>\r\n    frontend_config = json.load(f)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/json/__init__.py\", line 296, in load\r\n

decode byte 0xc2 in position 23166: ordinal not in range(128)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the [documentation] when using `open(...)` without an explicit encoding the encoding is [determined](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/text_file_processing.html#files-in-a-typical-platform-specific-encoding) from the OS. It seems prudent however to explicitly define the encoding when the encoding is [known](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/text_file_processing.html#files-in-a-consistent-known-encoding).\r\n\r\nNote there are other examples in the code base where the encoding is explicitly defined and thus this doesn't seem to be an anti-pattern. \r\n\r\nto: @graceguo-supercat @michellethomas @mistercrunch
