Those formatting changes were made with an older version of Ruff (pre-0.1.3) and, after the initial changes were made, were not re-formatted by future format attempts because the code was valid.\r\n\r\nThis PR resets those changes and uses Ruff v0.1.3 to re-format to valid (and easier to read) formats.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

you all. How are you doing?\r\n\r\nIt's an initiative of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35130\r\n\r\nThis PR brings two things:\r\n\r\n1. Values `workers.podAnnotations` and `airflowPodAnnotations` won't fight each other anymore. Value `workers.podAnnotations` will have precedence over `airflowPodAnnotations` value. Think of local scope and global scope (fallback). So specific settings can override generic settings on component side.\r\n2. Value `workers.safeToEvict` will be embedded into pod annotations. And `workers.podAnnotations` will have precedence over, so it keeps retrocompatibility on any workaround done in past by users.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\n## test_safetoevict_annotations (refactored)\r\n\r\nAbout the safeToEvict use cases. I did a \"full coverage\" of following scenarios:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pytest

`botocore.UNSIGNED` -> `unsigned` -> `botocore.UNSIGNED` in different places of Amazon provider:\r\n\r\n- Operators/Sensors: replace `botocore.UNSIGNED` to `unsigned`, so it could be pass to Triggers without problem with serialisation\r\n- Hooks: if config retrieved as dictionary, then replace `unsigned` to `botocore.UNSIGNED` before build `botocore.config.Config`\r\n- AwsConnectionWrapper: add

This PR also upgrades the version of Ruff to the latest.\r\n\r\nRunning locally:\r\n```sh\r\n> time black . --exclude=\"^.*/.*_vendor/|^tests/dags/test_imports.py|^airflow/contrib/\"\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n4137 files left unchanged.\r\nblack .   5.01s user 1.65s system 97% cpu 6.820 total\r\n\r\n> time ruff format . --exclude=\"^.*/.*_vendor/|^tests/dags/test_imports.py|^airflow/contrib/\"\r\n3999 files left unchanged\r\nruff format .   0.05s user 0.10s system 89% cpu 0.173 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis represents means **Ruff is ~40x faster than Black** (when there are no changes - when there are changes, I've seen it even higher).\r\n\r\nNote that this doesn't swap the formatter used in inline Python code in the docs as I haven't seen an easy way of getting the Ruff formatter working with it. Because of this, a lot of the Black code hasn't been removed (i.e. the code to upgrade black, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

PR is an improvement based on the feedback raised in issue #34726 and optimizes the layout of the trigger UI form.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes:\r\n- Run ID and Logic date are now in the folded section of generated JSON config - why? Because most users don't know what this is and (most probably) only advanced users know what to enter. Still for these advanced users it is needed and therefore in the collapsed section\r\n- Both fields nevertheless are added to the legacy form as well if `AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__SHOW_TRIGGER_FORM_IF_NO_PARAMS=True` is set\r\n- The DAG documentation is now always expanded in the UI allowing to show instructions to the users.\r\n- Update screenshot in the docs to new layout\r\n\r\nHow to test?\r\n- Launch the UI and and trigger the DAG `example_params_ui_tutorial` and check the form\r\n- Launch webserver with ENV `AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__SHOW_TRIGGER_FORM_IF_NO_PARAMS=True` and trigger the DAG `example_python_operator`with config\r\n- Check the Github old/new screenshow if you want to have a \"sneak preview\".\r\n\r\nUI Before: \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/acb5f157-197d-4590-887b-46ab6849671c)\r\n\r\nUI

we build the image with timeout, we fork the process and set alarm\r\nand create a new process group in order to be sure that all the parallel\r\nbuild processes can be killed easily with sending termination signal to\r\nprocess group on timeout. In order to wait for the forked process\r\nto complete we used waitpid, but we did not handle the status code\r\nproperly, so if the build failed, we returned with 0 exit code.\r\n\r\nThis had the side effect that \"Build CI image\" did not fail, instead\r\nthe next step (generating source providers failed instead and it was\r\nnot obvious that the CI image build failing was the root cause.\r\n\r\nThis PR properly retrieves the wait status and converts it to\r\nexit code - since we are still supporting Python 3.8 this is still\r\ndone using a bit nasty set of if statements - only in Python 3.9 we\r\nhave `os.waitstatus_to_exitcode` method to do it for us, but we cannot\r\nuse the method yet.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR is separated out from #35160 in order to make the big refactor and splitting out our test harness to DB and Non-DB tests far more easy to review.\r\n\r\nThis change contains purely adding db_tests markers to the tests that need them, and as such it requires very litte effort to review. Once this one is merged hoever, the #35160 will become way smaller in terms of number of files to review, which will make it far easier to review using GitHub Interface.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR reverts PR #35252 as the fix made in this PR just fixed one side effect.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately when initially the PR #33355 was created I did not see that all temporary scripts and in/out serialized values are written into the tmp folder of the venv and thus pollute the venv. As the vench in the cached case might be used by multiple task slots in parallel, temporary files in a cached venc really generate a concurrency issue - more than just a termination log.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Revers the efforts of @potiuk in #35252 - Sorry as termination log is now not kept but in a separate tmp folder I needed to remove the newly contributed pytest :-(\r\n- Instead each execution of external python/venv is not generating a dedicated temp folder for call data\r\n- The generation and use of the tmp path is pushed into the execution to reduce redundant code.\r\n\r\nIf there is a general demand to keep the termination log after a failed run, we need to find a mechanism on top of the tempfolder so that it is not deleted as cleanup.\r\n\r\nNote, the DIFF is much smaller if you ignore the whitespace.","created_at":"2023-10-29T23:08:44Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T13:18:05Z","closed_at":"2023-10-30T11:19:32Z","merged_at":"2023-10-30T11:19:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f48bc9bf825f26e310267e3d798016619c67a2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

This is because we fetch the last TI available from the DagRun within `DAG.fetch_callback`, and a DagRun isn't aware of the concept of a partial subset. Hence `ti.task = dag.get_task(ti.task_id)` results in a `TaskNotFound` exception.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we are:\r\n\r\n1. Adding DAG callback functions to the test DAG defined in  tests/jobs/test_backfill_job.py::TestBackfillJob::test_sub_set_subdag to cover this test case (which fails without below patch)\r\n2. If dag.partial, we filter out tis where ti.state == State.NONE within `DAG.fetch_callback`\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

PythonVirtualEnv and friends use cached venv, script and termination logs are stored in the venv. While this was fine for scripts because the env is locked and scripts were overwritten every time venv started - it was not the same for termination log.\r\n\r\nThe termination log remains in venv after venv completes (which is good for diagnostics) however when subsequent task failed without raising regular exception but just by sys.exit(), the termination log from previous task was found and such task would return AirflowException instead of CalledProcessError with the message coming from the previous task.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by deleting the termination log at the start of PythonVirtualenv task, when such termination log is present in the venv.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

becomes very popular and we already have some examples that are using duckdb in examples. This makes those examples fail in the breeze CI environment. Having duckdb in the environment would be great. Duckdb has no other python requirements - it's written in C++ mostly and only has wrapper in Python with C-bindings, so it does not introduce dependency problems.\r\n\r\nDuckDB maintainers release multiple binary packages for pretty much any platform out there - also they have conda release available, so it is pretty safe to include it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

to confuse the tests with Helm tests (where we just process Helm chart and verify if rendered templates look good) the Kubernetes test suite actually create K8S clusters (with Kind), build custom airflow Images and deploy them to those K8S cluster (all using latest sources of airflow, images and charts) and run several end-2-end tests + run Kubernetes Pod Operators with the real K8S clusters.\r\n\r\nTherefore \"K8S System\" name is a bit better than \"Helm\" and also allows to distinguish them from \"Helm Unit\" tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation

common.io provider release caused a few problems when preparing the new wave of the providers:\r\n\r\n* it missed link to security.rst (which is generated automatically anticipating SBOM generation in the near future)\r\n* it did not have proper min-version set in MIN_AIRFLOW_VERSION_EXCEPTIONS\r\n* it had single-backtick description that resulted in generated commit and changelog code - since it failed documentation building\r\n\r\nAll those errors have not been caught at PR time. This PR fixes them and introduces prevention from similar mistakes - future providers with similar errors will get nice errors generated in CI at \"docs publishing step\".\r\n\r\n* if some generated file is missing in the index user is asked to add the files in the index\r\n* if there are `backtick` errors they will be reported and pointed at\r\n* if there are liniting problems with generated .rst files they will be reported\r\n* the \"min airflow version\" is now taken directly from provider.yaml not from exception list - but only when it is bigger than current min version. This way, we will also not forget to remove the provider from the list of exceptions when we bump min version above the exception version\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

a follow-up of #33051 where I realized that some \"mesos\" leftovers are in the code, this is a cleanup-PR, It removes the generic connection in Airflow core that provides a \"Mesos Framework ID\".\r\n\r\nI crawled through the code back into history of Airflow 1.10 to find where it comes from. In Airflow 1.10  there was formerly a mesos executor supported which all had been treated as legacy and was removed when going to Airflow 2.0. Just a generic connection hook was left. Also I could not find any traces somewhere in code or documentation where it is still used. But as no mesos executor exists anymore and even the Spark provider only uses a direct URL as parameters this is really a leftover.\r\nAs it is not providing any benefit and preventing that somebody in the future need to crawl into history, I propose to remove it. It is not breaking because if somebody really is still using it, it will fall-back in the UI to \"generic\" and technically is still usable.","created_at":"2023-10-28T08:34:40Z","updated_at":"2023-10-29T22:00:19Z","closed_at":"2023-10-28T15:34:34Z","merged_at":"2023-10-28T15:34:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ea094f1f5c814a37ae8fc014bec47774b9fb18f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

of the scheduler tests tried to prevent DAG processor processing DAGs from \"tests/dags\" directory by setting processor_agent to Mock object:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n   self.job_runner.processor_agent = mock.MagicMock()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis, in connection with scheduler job cleaning all the tables and approach similar to:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        dag = self.dagbag.get_dag(\"test_retry_handling_job\")\r\n        dag_task1 = dag.get_task(\"test_retry_handling_op\")\r\n        dag.clear()\r\n        dag.sync_to_db()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAllowed the test to run in isolated space where only one or few DAGS were present in the DB.\r\n\r\nThis probably worked perfectly in the past, but after some changes in how DAGFileProcessor works this did not prevent DAGFileProcessor from running when _execute method in scheduler_job_runner has been executed, and standalone dag processor was not running, the processor_agent has been overwritten by a new DagFileProcessor in the `_execute` method of scheduler_job_runner.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if not self._standalone_dag_processor:\r\n            self.processor_agent = DagFileProcessorAgent(\r\n                dag_directory=Path(self.subdir),\r\n                max_runs=self.num_times_parse_dags,\r\n                processor_timeout=processor_timeout,\r\n                dag_ids=[],\r\n                pickle_dags=pickle_dags,\r\n                async_mode=async_mode,\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis led to a very subtle race condition which was more likely on machines with multiple cores/faster disk (so for example it led to #35204 which appeared on self-hosted (8 core) runners and did not appear on Public (2-core runners) or it could appear on an 8 core ARM Mac but not appear on 6 core Intel Mac (only on sqlite)\r\n\r\nIf the DAGFileProcessor managed to start and spawn some parsing processes and grab the DB write access for sqlite and those processes managed to parse some of the DAG files from tests/dags/ folder, those DAGs could have polutted the DAGs in the DB - leading to undesired effects (for example with test hanging while the scheduler job run attempted to process an unwanted subdag and got deadlocked in case of #35204.\r\n\r\nThe solution to that is to only set the processor_agent if not set already. This can only happen in unit tests when the `processor_agent` sets it to Mock object. For \"production\" the agent is only set once in the `_execute` methods so there is no risk involved in checking if it is not set already.\r\n\r\nFixes: #35204\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`remove_on_error` parameter of the `AzureContainerInstanceOperator` was not working as intended. When set to `False` it should only skip the removal of the Azure Container Group **if** the exit code is non-zero. For zero exit codes, the infra should be dropped. This was not happening, because the `on_kill` method did an additional check for this parameter, even though it was already being checking in the `execute` function. This led to the Azure infra always being left in place (also on success). This commit fixes that behaviour.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-27T09:56:26Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T18:04:48Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T18:04:48Z","merged_at":"2023-11-08T18:04:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"22d583403b79356d7ff604e8f3a3bad924764029","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471850767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUwNzY3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:microsoft-azure","name":"provider:microsoft-azure","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Azure-related

#35099 switched installation of the local venv for Airflow to released packages, in order to accomodate for case from #34729 where we locally install a new provider that is preinstalled but has not yet been released.\r\n\r\nThis however has the side-effect - some k8s tests are using K8S Pod operator to run the tests and if this operator has been changed, the local - modified - version of it is not going to be used for tests.\r\n\r\nAnother side effect is that in case of a new installation, when the constraint installation does not work (for example constraints in main are conflicting with released airflow), `pip` starts to backtrack - and for conflicting requirements it produces strange results (for example it attempts to install airflow 1.10 and fails due to \"slugify\" dependency.\r\n\r\nThe previous version of it had another problem - once installed, it had not changed, so in case someone used breeze to run k8s tests locally and iterated over changes in K8SPod Operator, only the version from the moment the k8s environment was installed was used.\r\n\r\nBoth cases are now handled better:\r\n\r\n* INSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCES is used as env variable to make sure new providers (including preinstalled providers) are found in Airfow sources, not in PyPI\r\n* The \".\" is used back in order to install Airflow but also the -e (editable) installation is used for it - so that any changes to local version of k8s are used. We are not using constraints for installation.\r\n* Dry run and verbose mode of installing the venv are improved a bit - they show better what's going on (and dry_run does not interact with the installation in unexpected ways - deleting the installed venv without recreating it).\r\n\r\nWe already handled a change that k8s test environment has been reinstalled after the requirements file changed and caching in CI includes the hash of the requirements file as content - so we do not need to handle reinstallation of the venv or caching in CI. The venv should be appropriately reinstalled as needed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

is no more need to regenerate the images manually via `breeze setup regenerate-command-images`. Also check for consistency of command configuration vs command parameters in Breeze is now done in pre-commit. This means that anyone making changes to Breeze and having pre-commit installed will have two steps less to keep the --help images generated and to keep consistency of flags in breeze commands.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR marks DB tests as such and allows to split execution\r\nof the tests in CI to run the DB tests with the various database\r\nwhile the non-db tests - without the DB in a separate run.\r\n\r\nIn order to do that, the code to select which tests to run has been\r\nmoved from `entrypoint_ci.sh` bash to breeze's Python code, which is\r\ngenerally much nicer to maintain and common for both \"DB\" and\r\n\"non-DB\" tests.\r\n\r\nThis will have the nice side effect that it will be easier in the\r\nfuture to manage different test types and contain some specific\r\nflaky test types.\r\n\r\nThis change also adds possibility to isolate some of the test types\r\nwhen parallel DB tests are run and adds new test type\r\nPythonOperator carved out Operator type. This test is best run in\r\nisolation becasue creating and destroing virtualenvs in Docker while\r\nrunning in parallel to other tests is very slow for some reason and\r\nleads to flaky tests.\r\n\r\nPython operator tests are therefore separated out from Operators and\r\ntreated separately as isolated tests.\r\n\r\nThis will help not only with speed but also with stability of the\r\ntest suite.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

@stikkireddy (#32221), and this PR aims to get their work to the finishing line.\r\n\r\nThese were the changes I made since #32221:\r\n\r\n* [x]  Rebase on the `main` branch\r\n* [x] Validate by running a real DAG that communicates with Databricks via this operator\r\n* [x] Remove the `databricks-sdk` dependency as a follow-up to a conversation with @stikkireddy, since the interfaces of this library are not stable yet. We can improve the operator in the future to use this after the 1.0 release. \r\n* [x] Validate by running a real DAG that communicates with Databricks via this operator\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
