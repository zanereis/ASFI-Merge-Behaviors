SUMMARY\r\nCurrently it's only possible to sort non-temporal charts by the series values if there are no dimensions selected. This adds the same sorting options to dimensional charts that's available for sorting the series. We still default to category name, so current charts will not be affected. This PR also moves the series sorting controls to `@superset-ui/chart-controls` to make them generally available.\r\n\r\nAlso note that in this case we're doing the sorting in the frontend, while in the dimensionless case we're doing the sorting in the backend. In the future we may want to consider adding this type of logic to the backend, or move all sorting to the frontend.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/231097350-6bba5039-60ec-467a-9e17-89b43adcbee0.mp4\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFixes initial cache miss when global async queries are used. \r\n\r\nCurrently, whenever a Jinja context is used in a query such as `url_params` with async queries enabled, a call to [get_form_data](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2.1/superset/jinja_context.py#L195) is made. `form_data` which has the url_params is used to generate extra cache keys. Right now, form_data is empty as there is no request context in async queries. This means that we are always encountering a cache miss on the first query. \r\n\r\nSince async queries won't have request context, we need to fallback to setting Flask global. https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/views/utils.py#L182\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR \r\nBEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19199254/231020152-a95035bb-fd15-4f9c-adfe-53f44dbe3f7b.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19199254/231018854-2ad51ab0-dc99-44c9-8475-74908034f800.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a table chart saved on a dashboard and edited from the dashboard, the table reloads in the edit view and the updated option returns to the previous setting.\r\nThis bug is a regression of [#20498](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20498/files#diff-d682f497999ba5051d4e8efe3a9a7c06d9cc97026e134d5f2eddcffe1e902f78R51), which reloads the fetchExploreData but always overrides it with the dashboardContext (which retains the original settings).\r\n\r\nThis hotfix adds the condition of overwrite saving to retrieve the changes from updated exploreFormData.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n- After:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/230680771-e68eae52-5710-42fd-a044-d9d57eae254a.mov\r\n\r\n-

Create a new Table chart\r\n2. Save and publish the chart to a dashboard\r\n3. Open the dashboard, and click \"Edit\" on the chart from the dashboard\r\n4. Go to \"Customize\" and uncheck \"Cell Bars\"\r\n5. Click save. The Cell Bars option returns to checked after saving.\r\n6. Exit and go to the \"Charts\" list in Superset\r\n7. Open your saved chart from the Charts list directly\r\n8. Go to \"Customize\" and uncheck \"Cell Bars\"\r\n9. Click save. The Cell Bars option retains the unchecked state\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB

SUMMARY\r\nThe `chown -R` command causes the `/app` directory contents from previous `COPY`'s to be copied up to the current layer. This results in additional redundant image size.\r\nBy using `COPY --chown` we can reduce the image size by ~130¬†MB.\r\n\r\nAlso\r\n- remove duplicate `COPY setup.py MANIFEST.in README.md /app/`\r\n- adjust indentation\r\n- fix `pip install` option from `--no-cache` to `--no-cache-dir`\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n`docker build -t superset --no-cache .`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nBefore, user could only drill by once, from the original chart. This PR implements  further drilling in the drill by modal. In drill by modal, only drill by action is available - drill to detail and cross filtering is not available.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/230602328-d32c18da-b432-4a6f-a1c5-7ab1553fdc03.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `DRILL_BY` ff\r\n2. Add a supported chart with groupby to a dashboard\r\n3. Drill by a column\r\n4. In the drill by modal, right click on a series to further drill by\r\n5. The result of further group by should render in the same modal\r\n6. The columns available for drilling should NOT contain columns that already were used for drilling before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nIncreases the options limit for Annotation Layers in Explore. Previously, the options were limited to 20 results which is a problem for organizations with many records. Following the same pattern used in filters, the limit was increased to a 1000 values. Although, 1000 values will probably be sufficient for most of organizations, the endgame solution would be to create a control using the `AsyncSelect` and replace the sync version. This change is not in the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"505\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-06 at 10 47 44\"

SUMMARY\r\nFixes #23610 \r\nThere is no \"saved_query\" enum value of object_type for saved queries as such. it should be \"query\" instead as it can be seen in ObjectTypes class.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE SCREENSHOTS\r\n<img width=\"1509\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-06 at 4 51 32 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25038017/230378106-e1bd5b2a-cc5d-40e7-9fe9-c9e0c4d49f51.png\">\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n- Saved queries list loads fine\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Setup Postgres as backend db (as the default sqlite db doesn't really strictly checks the enum type of object_type)\r\n2. Go to \"Saved queries\" page\r\n3. The list should load fine.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: #23610 \r\n- [ ] Required feature flags: TAGGING_SYSTEM\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23200 I added permission checks when importing related assets. Before, users importing dashboards could create databases and datasets as a side effect of the import, even if they didn't have the appropriate permissions. The PR added some extra checks to prevent this from happening:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/56dcf25cf8ac5ed47235ebacde07200ccba257b3/superset/databases/commands/importers/v1/utils.py#L34\r\n\r\nThe change above required modifying `load-examples` to run as a user with username \"admin\":\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/56dcf25cf8ac5ed47235ebacde07200ccba257b3/superset/commands/importers/v1/examples.py#L72\r\n\r\nBut the user \"admin\" might not exist, or might be called differently. So this PR changes `load-examples` so that the imports happen without a `current_user`, as before, while keeping the permission checks for other imports initiated via the UI.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

present in the `superset.connectors.base.models.BaseDatasource.data`property, i.e., \r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n  File \"<prefix>/superset/charts/post_processing.py\", line 352, in apply_post_process\r\n

(:issue:`2933`)\n<h2>v4.4.9 (2023-04-05)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.9</p>\n<pre><code>- Instead of raising ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when command output includes non-utf-8 bytes,\n  ``tox`` will now use ``surrogateescape`` error handling to convert the unrecognized bytes\n  to escape sequences according to :pep:`383` - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2969`)\n\nImproved Documentation - 4.4.9\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Document running tox within a Docker container. (:issue:&lt;code&gt;1035&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Added python version 3.11 to &lt;code&gt;installation.rst&lt;/code&gt;. (:issue:&lt;code&gt;2964&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;v4.4.8 (2023-03-26)&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bugfixes - 4.4.8&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- ``tox.ini`` is now included in source distributions in order to make all tests pass. (:issue:`2939`)\n- Fix ``--index-url`` and ``--find-links`` being used together in ``requirements.txt`` files.

SUMMARY\r\nLegacy charts had the ability to click on a legend item and exclusively select that series. This was really helpful, specially when you have many items and wishes to focus on only one. ECharts has a similar but more flexible feature called Legend selector that allows a user to select all items or invert the selection. This flexibility is specially helpful when you want to compare a few items among many. This PR enables that feature.\r\n\r\n@kasiazjc \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nWhen `GENERIC_CHART_AXES ` FF is on and we overwrite a chart, any filter coming from the dashboard is not saved (it gets removed since its marked as `isExtra`). However, removing such filter doesn't have to mean we delete the original temporal filter if any, otherwise the dashboard wont be able to filter the chart again.\r\n\r\nThis PR keeps the original `adhoc_filters` from the slice so when calling the PUT API it doesn't get removed. So any call to  `api/v1/dashboard/{db_id}/charts` is consistent even after you overwrite the chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/230181380-9ad725e5-f3d5-4329-84e4-9c7e0e897a5b.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/230218992-0714921c-e51e-4586-9881-d496d3d8229f.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Make sure `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` FF is ON\r\n2. Create a chart and add it to a dashboard.\r\n3. Add a time range filter to the dashboard and apply any value.\r\n4. Click on the chart title to access it in the Chart Builder menu.\r\n5. Overwrite the chart (no changes are needed).\r\n6. Go back to the dashboard, and apply any time range filter.\r\n7. The filter must keep working after overwriting the chart\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\nChanges the Email report functionality in Explore to behave in the same way as the dashboards and only allow editing after a chart is saved. Previously, the user could try to setup an email report but would face many errors because many parts of the feature depend on the saved state.\r\n\r\nIt improves rendering by returning the same instance of an empty `report`, used in `useEffect`, when there's none in the Redux store.\r\n\r\nIt also creates an specific `DELETE_REPORT` action to clearly separate the logic and avoid unnecessary queries.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nSince Celery 5.0 the global options (-A, --app) [can no longer](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/history/whatsnew-5.0.html#step-1-adjust-your-command-line-invocation) be positioned after the sub-command.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently it's impossible to use the normal RBAC model when the Dashboard RBAC  feature flag is enabled. This is contrary to the description, which on one hand states that when the FF is enabled and no roles are chosen, ALL datasets are accessible, and on the other hand states that regular dataset perms apply.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the logic is as follows:\r\n- If no roles are defined for a dashboard, regular RBAC always applies.\r\n- If a role/roles are defined for a dashboard, those take precedent, i.e. regular RBAC no longer applies. This is unchanged\r\n- Datasource permission checks now check if the user has Dashboard RBAC access to a dashboard that references the dataset - if it does, the datasource is assumed to be accessible. If not, regular RBAC applies.\r\n\r\nIn addition, tests are added, and the documentation is aligned with how the feature actually works.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when trying to access a dashboard the user didn't have access to, they would either be greeted by one of the following:\r\n\r\nRegular RBAC:\r\n<img width=\"1201\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/230331591-b4b4734f-0767-4a5c-8c7c-a8fb312be9e7.png\">\r\n\r\nDashboard RBAC:\r\n<img width=\"615\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/230331728-a1a2caac-8680-4775-b95a-0c33991430cb.png\">\r\n\r\nNow they get redirected to the main page with the following toast:\r\n<img width=\"1198\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/230311995-8d07be5a-ea6b-4d03-8674-4ef0e3e2398b.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

imported via a dashboard import contain references to the chart's old datasource id from when it was exported within their `params` and `query_context`.  This didn't result in any functionality breaking, but it would result in the following \"false alarm\" error message when loading the dashboard:\r\n\r\n![Clipboard 2023-02-03 at 5 35 47 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47196419/229955419-73f0150e-9824-41ab-bb9a-d780d28305ef.png)\r\n\r\nThere is precedent for this fix in the individual chart import, see here: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/charts/commands/importers/v1/__init__.py#L96\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

Granted we could try to roll forward with a formulation which works for both legacy and non-legacy charts, but in the interim I think it's prudent we ensure we don't regress whilst acknowledging the fact that cache warmup for non-legacy charts is still problematic.\r\n\r\ncc: @dheeraj-jaiswal-lowes \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR enables opening Drill By chart in Explore. The feature is similar to \"Edit chart\" in Dashboard, except in this case we treat the drill by result as a completely new chart - which means that we don't preserve the original chart's id or name. Additionally, the filters inherited from dashboard (native filters, cross filters) are not treated as \"extra\" filters, which means they will get saved with the chart (as opposed to editing an existing chart from the dashboard).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/229819841-96b70a63-3d48-451b-a4c7-40d96c5e545a.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Enable `DRILL_BY` ff\r\n1. Right click on a series -> drill by -> column\r\n2. In drill by modal, click (or right click to open in new tab) \"Edit chart\"\r\n3. You should see exactly the same chart in Explore as it was in the drill by modal. Compared to original chart, the adhoc filters have additional filter equal to clicked series appended, and groupby is replaced by clicked column.\r\n4. If there were any native filters or cross filters in the dashboard, they are added as adhoc filters in Explore, but NOT as \"extra\" filters - they don't have the warning icon and they will get saved with the chart.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23012/, when warming a non-legacy chart it's valid for the error to be a babel form of `Empty query?` which is not JSON serializable, i.e., `json.dumps(...)` raises the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Object of type LazyString is not JSON serializable\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix to to use the the `base_json_conv` serialization method. Having `json.dump(...)` splattered throughout the code is rather unfortunate as there's no consistency in how payload are serialized. Ideally exceptions should be raised and handled in a uniform way per [SIP-41](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9298).  \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23400 fixed the following error:\r\n\r\n> When the search was conducted using the \"Dynamically search all filter values\" in FilterBar, the original options got lost and the Select component was selecting all values as a consequence.\r\n\r\nThe strategy used for the fix was to store an array of the initial data and always append it when updating the select options. This caused a unintended problem with filter dependencies because the initial data may not be present when the filter values are affected by other filters.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that \"Dynamically search all filter values\" is used when the number of options available exceeds the 1000 threshold and the user needs to search for values that are not loaded on the client side. At this moment, the select is very similar to an async select and the Select All feature will have many challenges as you can see [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20143). \r\n\r\nThis PR removes the initial data state to fix the dependencies bug and also disables Select All when \"Dynamically search all filter values\" is checked.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nExporting the full CSV on the table chart with server pagination was not working properly as it was exporting only the selected page. \r\n\r\nAfter investigation, I found that the issue is because the row limit was being overridden. As a fix, I added a check to verify if the result type is full, and in that case, we won't allow editing the row_limit prop.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nYou can see below a recording showing that all the data is present in the exported csv file:\r\n\r\n[Bug Solution

`ALLOW_FULL_CSV_EXPORT` flag\r\n- Go to a table with server pagination enabled\r\n- On the action menu, select download and click on `Export FULL CSV`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdds the heatmap layer from deck.gl [here](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/aggregation-layers/heatmap-layer).\r\n\r\nRelated SIP: https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/23553\r\n\r\n**_Rationale_**:\r\n\r\nSuperset already has supported functionality for other deck.gl visualization layers (e.g. Arc, Geojson, Grid, Hex, Path, Polygon, Scatter, Screengrid). Since Superset already contains the logic to handle deck.gl layers, it is straightforward and easy to maintain to add new deck.gl layers. \r\n\r\nBy expanding the range of available deck.gl visualization layers, users will have more options to choose from when creating their visualizations. This will allow them to tailor their visualizations to their specific needs and explore their data in different ways. It will also allow Superset to better compete with other data visualization tools on the market that offer a wider range of visualization options.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think adding more deck.gl layers to Superset is a great idea and has the potential to significantly improve the user experience and the insights that users can gain from their data.\r\n\r\n**_Design Decisions_**\r\n\r\nThe addition of the Heatmap layer follows the structure of existing deck.gl layers to maintain readability and consistency within the codebase. \r\n\r\nStructure: \r\nThe directory `superset-frontend/plugins/legacy-preset-chart-deckgl/src/layers/Heatmap/` contains the front end structure for the heat map\r\n- `controlPanel` configures the form to grab relevant information specified by the user to create and tune the heatmap.\r\n- `Heatmap.jsx` contains functions that define the Heatmap Layer, control the tooltip when hover the chart, and to get relevant data\r\n- `index.js` serves as the wrapper for the heatmap component and provides a metadata function to grab information to descrive what this visualization is/does\r\n\r\nThe Back End code for this feature follows the back end code for other deck.gl visualizations as well, providing functions to structure queried data for the Heatmap component.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nNew visualization recording:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36670322/229327601-22f81978-174e-41c0-8f8f-6cf7ea66691d.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Start Superset\r\n2. Click on the `Charts` tab at the top of the screen\r\n3. Click the `+ Chart` button at the top right\r\n4. Load a dataset with geo-positional data (longitude/latitude)\r\n5. Search the charts for `Deck.gl Heatmap` or click on the `Map` chart category\r\n6. Select `deck.gl Heatmap` and hit `Create New Chart`\r\n7. Update the `Longitude & Latitude` field to the correct columns\r\n8. Select a `Weight` function\r\n9. Select `Create Chart`\r\n10. There should now be a heat map layer present on the screen\r\n    - Note: the underlying map component may not be visible if the MAP_BOX_API_KEY is not set. To set it follow the instructions [here](https://superset.apache.org/docs/frequently-asked-questions/#why-is-the-map-not-visible-in-the-geospatial-visualization)\r\n11. Change the options in the control panel, check that the information tooltips are correct/make sense for each field\r\n12.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nin preset, we are experiencing issues with tags being referenced in the \"Edit properties\" pages. We aren't able to reproduce locally but think on app load something is going on with the model being able to reference tags, and isn't being passed properly through the api even though the flag is enabled.

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20684 introduced a change to allow a user to add charts owned/created by others to their dashboards. While this is a reasonable use case, the way it was implemented was to always display all charts accessible to the user which resulted in problems for organizations that contain many charts. From this [comment](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20684#issuecomment-1307873917), we can see some of the user feedback:\r\n\r\n> To me the experience is degraded, because almost all charts I add are created by me, and there‚Äôs a clear candidate for the next chart to add, i.e., it‚Äôs the chart most recently created by me.\r\n> \r\n> Of course it‚Äôs good to be able to add charts created by others, but I would think that maybe this could be visible through a toggle (default is to show charts created by me, with toggle in ‚Äúon‚Äù stage for ‚Äúfilter to my charts‚Äù).\r\n> \r\n> This change of removing the filter might be an improvement in a small company, but in a big place it‚Äôs very unlikely that charts by others are useful to me, there‚Äôs just too many.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the dashboard editor to show by default only the charts owned or created by the user and gives the user an option to show other charts that are accessible to them. The reason for showing user charts by default is because it's more likely they will interact with their own charts and also for performance reasons, as we don't need to load all the metadata associated with a big number of charts upfront.\r\n\r\nThis PR also:\r\n- Rewrites `actions/sliceEntities` using Typescript to improve type checking and also simplify its logic\r\n- Removes items loaded in the Redux store after the user leaves editing mode\r\n\r\nWhile developing, it was clear that we should also rewrite `components/SliceAdder` to simplify its logic and get rid of the `react-virtualized-auto-sizer` and `react-search-input` dependencies but I'll leave this to a follow up to simplify the review process.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

to `ALERT_REPORTS_NOTIFICATION_DRY_RUN = True` in cofing.py, which isn't the case. In fact, the config.py sets `ALERT_REPORTS_NOTIFICATION_DRY_RUN` to `False` by default. Additionally the `REDIS_HOST` was referring to `redis-superset` but the Docker publishes `superset_cache` instead.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22614 introduced an issue for which the reports would not be able to execute when a filter of the FilterBar required immediate execution (see for example filters with first filter value selected by default). The reason is that the logics that run the filters are often encapsulated within the rendering of the component. By removing the rendering of the FilterBar those filters failed to execute causing the reports to fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an additional way to hide the FilterBar through the `hidden` property, which effectively only hides the FilterBar with CSS while still rendering it. While not an optimal solution, this will unblock the reports. A more in-depth refactor is required to decouple the logics of the filters from the rendering of the component.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Visit a Dashboard with a filter having first filter value selected by default\r\n2. Enter reports standalone mode with `standalone=3` in the url\r\n3. Make sure the Dashboard loads while the FilterBar is hidden\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\nThe \"Include time\" control in Table chart is not working properly when GENERIC_CHART_AXES is enabled because of lack of the time column in chart settings. \r\nThis PR removes the `include_time` checkbox and if `include_time` was true before and `granularity_sqla` was set, it moves the `granularity_sqla` column to dimensions. The end result is the same as with the checkbox, except that the label of the time column is actual column name rather than \"Time\".\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-30 at 13 54 33\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/228828123-1cac786b-34af-49d5-b0c5-6586bce5f47f.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/229106788-0a52818b-fdf6-48f4-83fb-d87dbedfa4cf.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Disable GENERIC_CHART_AXES\r\n2. Create a table chart and check \"Include time\", add a time column\r\n3. Enable GENERIC_CHART_AXES\r\n4. The \"Include time\" checkbox should disappear, the time column should now be added to Dimensions\r\n5. Nothing should happen if \"Include time\" was not checked before enabling the feature flag\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe original tags migration ended up using native postgres enums for some columns. This can cause issues since updates to the enum require a migration to alter the enum type (more info [here](https://makimo.pl/blog/upgrading-postgresqls-enum-type-with-sqlalchemy-using-alembic-migration/)). This lack of flexibility makes using postgres enums challenging. Converting the column types to varchar and allowing SQL Alchemy to handle to enum type should be fine and give us the most flexibility moving forward to add other tag types. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n_Addition to #23265 fix_\r\nWhen SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE has been deactivated after activated, active_tab will be provided during localstorage persistence mode.\r\nThis causes the appending duplicated table_schemas value every time page is loaded. (This causes the increasing localStorage size)\r\nThis commit adds the dedupe logic to clean up the duplicated values.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new Superset plugin using the plugin generator, the generated code contains linter errors that prevent Superset from building properly. This PR updates the generator `erb` templates so that they do not contain linter errors.\r\n\r\nNote: Plugins with very long names may still generate linter errors, due to excessive line length\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n####

configure a dashboard filter to automatically select the first value by default. However, when this function was used the dashboard didn't load properly.\r\n\r\nThe culprit was a redundant `useEffect` that caused the filter value to reset to `undefined`. By removing the redundant `useEffect` the issue is resolved.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/228280229-36b8ca35-4291-470f-87e4-12d18ba1c6f6.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a Dashboard\r\n2. Create a filter with first default value\r\n3. The Dashboard should load successfully\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new Superset plugin, the generator creates a `tsconfig.json` file. When trying to build Superset with this new plugin, the build fails due to TypeScript compilation errors.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the README documentation of a generated plugin to call out some of the changes a user may want to make to fix these TypeScript errors. These suggested changes already exist in the `echarts` plugins, and served as inspiration for how to fix the TypeScript errors I encountered in my own plugin.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nScreenshots of TypeScript errors after creating the plugin:\r\n\r\n![screenshot-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128753205/228025355-9e992a67-f65a-418b-9807-88220448557c.png)\r\n![screenshot-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128753205/228025368-9c8d4249-3977-4244-83fc-66ddbac35a23.png)\r\n![screenshot-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128753205/228025383-5643f079-fd08-4d89-89f5-be23cbf4d6b8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n* Use the generator to create a new Superset plugin in the `superset-frontend/plugins/` directory alongside other plugins\r\n* Follow the final manual steps to add this plugin to `MainPreset.js` and `package.json`\r\n* Try to build Superset\r\n* Notice that there are TypeScript errors such as unresolvable modules (`@superset-ui/core`)\r\n* Notice that there are TypeScript errors such as unresolved Superset types\r\n* Make the new changes suggested in the plugin README file\r\n* Notice that the errors are resolved and the plugin will build successfully\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-27T17:54:05Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T20:26:23Z","closed_at":"2023-03-28T01:34:26Z","merged_at":"2023-03-28T01:34:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"a3ffc67238c3216340071b98201511afea13bc96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kristw","id":1659771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTk3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1659771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw","html_url":"https://github.com/kristw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è
