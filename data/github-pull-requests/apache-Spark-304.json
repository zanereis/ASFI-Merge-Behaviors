What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\njira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22289 \r\n\r\nadd JSON encoding/decoding for Param[Matrix]. \r\n\r\nThe issue was reported by Nic Eggert during saving LR model with LowerBoundsOnCoefficients. \r\nThere're two ways to resolve this as I see:\r\n1. Support save/load on LogisticRegressionParams, and also adjust the save/load in LogisticRegression and LogisticRegressionModel.\r\n2. Directly support Matrix in Param.jsonEncode, similar to what we have done for Vector.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion in jira, we prefer the fix to support Matrix as a valid Param type, for simplicity and convenience for other classes.\r\n\r\nNote that in the implementation, I added a \"class\" field in the JSON object to match different JSON converters when loading, which is for preciseness and future extension.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew unit test to cover the LR case and JsonMatrixConverter\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-18T07:00:44Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T22:13:37Z","closed_at":"2017-12-12T19:29:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"76475acc24648b4ff56980d8939dbd5305110ffb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/579945668e6f7e93d76102185bdf1d274e6c7773","head":{"label":"hhbyyh:lrsave","ref":"lrsave","sha":"579945668e6f7e93d76102185bdf1d274e6c7773","user":{"login":"hhbyyh","id":7981698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODE2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7981698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh","html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29568485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTU2ODQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"hhbyyh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hhbyyh","id":7981698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODE2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7981698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh","html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSeems there was a mistake - missing import for `subprocess.call`, while refactoring this script a long ago, which should be used for backports of some missing functions in `subprocess`, specifically in < Python 2.7.\r\n\r\nReproduction is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd dev && python2.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from sparktestsupport import shellutils\r\n>>> shellutils.subprocess_check_call(\"ls\")\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"sparktestsupport/shellutils.py\", line 46, in subprocess_check_call\r\n    retcode = call(*popenargs, **kwargs)\r\nNameError: global name 'call' is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Jenkins logs, please see https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/NewSparkPullRequestBuilder/3950/console\r\n\r\nSince we dropped the Python 2.6.x support, looks better we remove those workarounds and print out explicit error messages in order to reduce the efforts to find out the root causes for such cases, for example, `https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19513#issuecomment-337406734`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./dev/run-tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nPython versions prior to 2.7 are not supported.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n./dev/run-tests-jenkins\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nPython versions prior to 2.7 are not supported.\r\n```","created_at":"2017-10-18T02:22:51Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:41:21Z","closed_at":"2017-10-21T17:25:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85b2408d399a028de18fa5292328fa11c06e4ae0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19524/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19524/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19524/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/de2a70b2279d214022b1d575270ff7a38764d26f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-22302","ref":"SPARK-22302","sha":"de2a70b2279d214022b1d575270ff7a38764d26f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark Executor Page will return a blank list when the application id contains a forward slash. You can see the /allexecutors api failing with a 404. This can be fixed trivially by url encoding the appId before making the call to `/api/v1/applications/<appId>/allexecutors` in executorspage.js.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n<img

SparkSubmit uses system properties to propagate configuration to\r\napplications. This makes it hard to implement features such as SPARK-11035,\r\nwhich would allow multiple applications to be started in the same JVM. The\r\ncurrent code would cause the config data from multiple apps to get mixed\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a new trait, currently internal to Spark, that allows\r\nthe app configuration to be passed directly to the application, without\r\nhaving to use system properties. The current \"call main() method\" behavior\r\nis maintained as an implementation of this new trait. This will be useful\r\nto allow multiple cluster mode apps to be submitted from the same JVM.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, SparkSubmit was modified to collect all configuration\r\ndirectly into a SparkConf instance. Most of the changes are to tests so\r\nthey use SparkConf instead of an opaque map.\r\n\r\nTested with existing and added unit tests.","created_at":"2017-10-17T18:58:37Z","updated_at":"2017-10-26T18:33:04Z","closed_at":"2017-10-26T07:53:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f31da9d8ad82acf1b7aae00a4427527cbab08e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19519/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19519/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19519/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/191513542da1c11f66dd96cca472babe68b4f630","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-21840","ref":"SPARK-21840","sha":"191513542da1c11f66dd96cca472babe68b4f630","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is the part two followup to #18075, meant to address [SPARK-18016](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/SPARK-18016), Constant Pool limit exceptions. Part 1 implemented `NestedClass` code splitting, in which excess code was split off into nested private sub-classes of the `OuterClass`. In Part 2 we address excess mutable state, in which the number of inlined variables declared at the top of the `OuterClass` can also exceed the constant pool limit. \r\n\r\nHere, we modify the `addMutableState` function in the `CodeGenerator` to check if the declared state can be easily initialized compacted into an array and initialized in loops rather than inlined and initialized with its own line of code. We identify four types of state that can compacted:\r\n\r\n* Primitive state (ints, booleans, etc)\r\n* Object state of like-type without any initial assignment\r\n* Object state of like-type initialized to `null`\r\n* Object state of like-type initialized to the type's base (no-argument) constructor\r\n\r\nWith mutable state compaction, at the top of the class we generate array declarations like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate Object[] references;\r\nprivate UnsafeRow result;\r\nprivate org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.BufferHolder holder;\r\nprivate org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter rowWriter;\r\n  ...\r\nprivate boolean[] mutableStateArray1 = new boolean[12507];\r\nprivate InternalRow[] mutableStateArray4 = new InternalRow[5268];\r\nprivate org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeArrayWriter[] mutableStateArray5 = new org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeArrayWriter[7663];\r\nprivate java.lang.String[] mutableStateArray2 = new java.lang.String[12477];\r\nprivate int[] mutableStateArray = new int[42509];\r\nprivate java.lang.Object[] mutableStateArray6 = new java.lang.Object[30];\r\nprivate boolean[] mutableStateArray3 = new boolean[10536];\r\n```\r\n\r\nand these arrays are initialized in loops as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void init_3485() {\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < mutableStateArray3.length; i++) {\r\n        mutableStateArray3[i] = false;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor compacted mutable state, `addMutableState` returns an array accessor value, which is then referenced in the subsequent generated code.\r\n\r\n**Note**: some state cannot be easily compacted (except without perhaps deeper changes to generating code), as some state value names are taken for granted at the global level during code generation (see `CatalystToExternalMap` in `Objects` as an example). For this state, we provide an `inline` hint to the function call, which indicates that the state should be inlined to the `OuterClass`. Still, the state we can easily compact manages to reduce the Constant Pool to an tractable size for the wide/deeply nested schemas I was able to test against.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested against several complex schema types, also added a test case generating 40,000 string columns and creating the `UnsafeProjection`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo limit the amount of resources a spark job accept from Mesos, currently we can only use `spark.cores.max` to limit in terms of cpu cores.\r\nHowever, when we have big memory executors, it would consume all the resources.\r\n\r\nThis PR added `spark.mem.max` option for Mesos\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded Unit

delegation tokens are only needed when the Spark driver has no access\r\nto the kerberos TGT. That happens only in two situations:\r\n\r\n- when using a proxy user\r\n- when using cluster mode without a keytab\r\n\r\nThis change modifies the Hive provider so that it only generates delegation\r\ntokens in those situations, and tweaks the YARN AM so that it makes the proper\r\nuser visible to the Hive code when running with keytabs, so that the TGT\r\ncan be used instead of a delegation token.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this change is that now it's possible to initialize multiple,\r\nnon-concurrent SparkContext instances in the same JVM. Before, the second\r\ninvocation would fail to fetch a new Hive delegation token, which then could\r\nmake the second (or third or...) application fail once the token expired.\r\nWith this change, the TGT will be used to authenticate to the HMS instead.\r\n\r\nThis change also avoids polluting the current logged in user's credentials\r\nwhen launching applications. The credentials are copied only when running\r\napplications as a proxy user. This makes it possible to implement SPARK-11035\r\nlater, where multiple threads might be launching applications, and each app\r\nshould have its own set of credentials.\r\n\r\nTested by verifying HDFS and Hive access in following scenarios:\r\n- client and cluster mode\r\n- client and cluster mode with proxy user\r\n- client and cluster mode with principal / keytab\r\n- long-running cluster app with principal / keytab\r\n- pyspark app that creates (and stops) multiple SparkContext instances\r\n  through its lifetime\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-17T00:04:17Z","updated_at":"2017-10-26T18:32:41Z","closed_at":"2017-10-19T06:59:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80622225a4f945c2ebbccb8faf7710a1476be3b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19509/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19509/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19509/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/94223beaeffa9793fc1529bafd8a65b4b3185d7a","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-22290","ref":"SPARK-22290","sha":"94223beaeffa9793fc1529bafd8a65b4b3185d7a","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of `ApproxCountDistinctForIntervals` is `ImperativeAggregate`. The number of `aggBufferAttributes` is the number of total words in the hllppHelper array. Each hllppHelper has 52 words by default relativeSD.\r\n\r\nSince this aggregate function is used in equi-height histogram generation, and the number of buckets in histogram is usually hundreds, the number of `aggBufferAttributes` can easily reach tens of thousands or even more.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a huge method in codegen and causes error: \r\n```\r\norg.codehaus.janino.JaninoRuntimeException: Code of method \"apply(Lorg/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/InternalRow;)Lorg/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/UnsafeRow;\" of class \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection\" grows beyond 64 KB. \r\n```\r\nBesides, huge generated methods also result in performance regression.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we change its implementation to `TypedImperativeAggregate`. After the fix, `ApproxCountDistinctForIntervals` can deal with more than thousands endpoints without throwing codegen error, and improve performance from `20 sec` to `2 sec` in a test case of 500 endpoints.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest by an added test case and existing tests.","created_at":"2017-10-16T09:01:15Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T22:05:29Z","closed_at":"2017-10-23T22:05:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5726113f3bf9ce8963c8ff027944d4a332bebf07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1e95a2f6b7c934893b05fb396916568e8a73d523","head":{"label":"wzhfy:change_forIntervals_typedAgg","ref":"change_forIntervals_typedAgg","sha":"1e95a2f6b7c934893b05fb396916568e8a73d523","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to wrap the transformed rdd within `TransformFunction`. `PythonTransformFunction` looks requiring to return `JavaRDD` in `_jrdd`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/39e2bad6a866d27c3ca594d15e574a1da3ee84cc/python/pyspark/streaming/util.py#L67\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6ee28423ad1b2e6089b82af64a31d77d3552bb38/streaming/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/streaming/api/python/PythonDStream.scala#L43\r\n\r\nHowever, this could be `JavaPairRDD` by some APIs, for example, `zip` in PySpark's RDD API.\r\n`_jrdd` could be checked as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> rdd.zip(rdd)._jrdd.getClass().toString()\r\nu'class org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaPairRDD'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, here, I wrapped it with `map` so that it ensures returning `JavaRDD`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> rdd.zip(rdd).map(lambda x: x)._jrdd.getClass().toString()\r\nu'class org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDD'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to elaborate some failure cases as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext\r\nssc = StreamingContext(spark.sparkContext, 10)\r\nssc.queueStream([sc.range(10)]) \\\r\n    .transform(lambda rdd: rdd.cartesian(rdd)) \\\r\n    .pprint()\r\nssc.start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext\r\nssc = StreamingContext(spark.sparkContext, 10)\r\nssc.queueStream([sc.range(10)]).foreachRDD(lambda rdd: rdd.cartesian(rdd))\r\nssc.start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext\r\nssc = StreamingContext(spark.sparkContext, 10)\r\nssc.queueStream([sc.range(10)]).foreachRDD(lambda rdd: rdd.zip(rdd))\r\nssc.start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext\r\nssc = StreamingContext(spark.sparkContext, 10)\r\nssc.queueStream([sc.range(10)]).foreachRDD(lambda rdd: rdd.zip(rdd).union(rdd.zip(rdd)))\r\nssc.start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext\r\nssc = StreamingContext(spark.sparkContext,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Average.scala, it has\r\n```\r\n  override lazy val evaluateExpression = child.dataType match {\r\n    case DecimalType.Fixed(p, s) =>\r\n      // increase the precision and scale to prevent precision loss\r\n      val dt = DecimalType.bounded(p + 14, s + 4)\r\n      Cast(Cast(sum, dt) / Cast(count, dt), resultType)\r\n    case _ =>\r\n      Cast(sum, resultType) / Cast(count, resultType)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  def setChild (newchild: Expression) = {\r\n    child = newchild\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\nIt is possible that  Cast(count, dt), resultType) will make the precision of the decimal number bigger than 38, and this causes over flow.  Since count is an integer and doesn't need a scale, I will cast it using DecimalType.bounded(38,0)\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nIn DataFrameSuite, I will add a test case. \r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nComplex state-updating and/or timeout-handling logic in mapGroupsWithState functions may require taking decisions based on the current event-time watermark and/or processing time. Currently, you can use the SQL function `current_timestamp` to get the current processing time, but it needs to be passed inserted in every row with a select, and then passed through the encoder, which isn't efficient. Furthermore, there is no way to get the current watermark.\r\n\r\nThis PR exposes both of them through the GroupState API. \r\nAdditionally, it also cleans up some of the GroupState docs. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe fix introduces support for parsing array of primitive types in the `from_json` function. Currently, it supports only array of struct, which is equivalent to array of JSON objects, but it doesn't allow to parse array of simple types, like array of strings (eg. `[\"this is a valid JSON\", \"we cannot parse before the PR\"]`).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-13T12:43:46Z","updated_at":"2018-07-22T17:48:02Z","closed_at":"2018-07-22T17:46:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e7b6fede1f3eb5770b3fc71b48367bd4891897b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19492/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19492/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19492/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29d6b96f0d118f2fac3c80b7a5946c83bfca480b","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-22228","ref":"SPARK-22228","sha":"29d6b96f0d118f2fac3c80b7a5946c83bfca480b","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo let the same aggregate function that appear multiple times in an Aggregate be evaluated only once, we need to deduplicate the aggregate expressions. The original code was trying to use a \"distinct\" call to get a set of aggregate expressions, but did not work, since the \"distinct\" did not compare semantic equality. And even if it did, further work should be done in result expression rewriting.\r\nIn this PR, I changed the \"set\" to a map mapping the semantic identity of a aggregate expression to itself. Thus, later on, when rewriting result expressions (i.e., output expressions), the aggregate expression reference can be fixed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-18016 introduced `NestedClass` to avoid that the many methods generated by `splitExpressions` contribute to the outer class' constant pool, making it growing too much. Unfortunately, despite their definition is stored in the `NestedClass`, they all are invoked in the outer class and for each method invocation, there are two entries added to the constant pool: a `Methodref` and a `Utf8` entry (you can easily check this compiling a simple sample class with `janinoc` and looking at its Constant Pool). This limits the scalability of the solution with very large methods which are split in a lot of small ones. This means that currently we are generating classes like this one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass SpecificUnsafeProjection extends org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.UnsafeProjection {\r\n...\r\n  public UnsafeRow apply(InternalRow i) {\r\n     rowWriter.zeroOutNullBytes();\r\n     apply_0(i);\r\n     apply_1(i);\r\n...\r\n    nestedClassInstance.apply_862(i);\r\n    nestedClassInstance.apply_863(i);\r\n...\r\n    nestedClassInstance1.apply_1612(i);\r\n    nestedClassInstance1.apply_1613(i);\r\n...\r\n  }\r\n...\r\n  private class NestedClass {\r\n    private void apply_862(InternalRow i) { ... }\r\n    private void apply_863(InternalRow i) { ... }\r\n...\r\n  }\r\n  private class NestedClass1 {\r\n    private void apply_1612(InternalRow i) { ... }\r\n    private void apply_1613(InternalRow i) { ... }\r\n...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR reduce the Constant Pool size of the outer class by adding a new method to each nested class: in this method we invoke all the small methods generated by `splitExpression` in that nested class. In this way, in the outer class there is only one method invocation per nested class, reducing by orders of magnitude the entries in its constant pool because of method invocations. This means that after the patch the generated code becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass SpecificUnsafeProjection extends org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.UnsafeProjection {\r\n...\r\n  public UnsafeRow apply(InternalRow i) {\r\n     rowWriter.zeroOutNullBytes();\r\n     apply_0(i);\r\n     apply_1(i);\r\n     ...\r\n     nestedClassInstance.apply(i);\r\n     nestedClassInstance1.apply(i);\r\n     ...\r\n  }\r\n...\r\n  private class NestedClass {\r\n    private void apply_862(InternalRow i) { ... }\r\n    private void apply_863(InternalRow i) { ... }\r\n...\r\n    private void apply(InternalRow i) {\r\n      apply_862(i);\r\n      apply_863(i);\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  private class NestedClass1 {\r\n    private void

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEqui-height histogram is effective in cardinality estimation, and more accurate than basic column stats (min, max, ndv, etc) especially in skew distribution. So we need to support it.\r\n\r\nFor equi-height histogram, all buckets (intervals) have the same height (frequency).\r\nIn this PR, we use a two-step method to generate an equi-height histogram:\r\n1. use `ApproximatePercentile` to get percentiles `p(0), p(1/n), p(2/n) ... p((n-1)/n), p(1)`;\r\n2. construct range values of buckets, e.g. `[p(0), p(1/n)], [p(1/n), p(2/n)] ... [p((n-1)/n), p(1)]`, and use `ApproxCountDistinctForIntervals` to count ndv in each bucket. Each bucket is of the form: `(lowerBound, higherBound, ndv)`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test cases and modified some existing test cases.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-12T08:16:21Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T15:44:28Z","closed_at":"2017-11-14T15:44:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a6643bc02e0258f4b7da175290fee9fa6573723","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b6d211f4f082415cc182de9e34f7420d65e94eb","head":{"label":"wzhfy:generate_histogram","ref":"generate_histogram","sha":"7b6d211f4f082415cc182de9e34f7420d65e94eb","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the current BlockManager's `getRemoteBytes`, it will call `BlockTransferService#fetchBlockSync` to get remote block. In the `fetchBlockSync`, Spark will allocate a temporary `ByteBuffer` to store the whole fetched block. This will potentially lead to OOM if block size is too big or several blocks are fetched simultaneously in this executor.\r\n\r\nSo here leveraging the idea of shuffle fetch, to spill the large block to local disk before consumed by upstream code. The behavior is controlled by newly added configuration, if block size is smaller than the threshold, then this block will be persisted in memory; otherwise it will first spill to disk, and then read from disk file.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this feature, what I did is:\r\n\r\n1. Rename `TempShuffleFileManager` to `TempFileManager`, since now it is not only used by shuffle.\r\n2. Add a new `TempFileManager` to manage the files of fetched remote blocks, the files are tracked by weak reference, will be deleted when no use at all.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested by adding UT, also manual verification in local test to perform GC to clean the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18064, we allowed `RunnableCommand` to have children in order to fix some UI issues. Then we made `InsertIntoXXX` commands take the input `query` as a child, when we do the actual writing, we just pass the physical plan to the writer(`FileFormatWriter.write`).\r\n\r\nHowever this is problematic. In Spark SQL, optimizer and planner are allowed to change the schema names a little bit. e.g. `ColumnPruning` rule will remove no-op `Project`s, like `Project(\"A\", Scan(\"a\"))`, and thus change the output schema from \"<A: int>\" to `<a: int>`. When it comes to writing, especially for self-description data format like parquet, we may write the wrong schema to the file and cause null values at the read path.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18450 , we decided to allow nested execution and one query can map to multiple executions in the UI. This releases the major restriction in #18604 , and now we don't have to take the input `query` as child of `InsertIntoXXX` commands.\r\n\r\nSo the fix is simple, this PR partially revert #18064 and make `InsertIntoXXX` commands leaf nodes again.\r\n \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

There are two advantages to use `MemoryBlock`\r\n1. Increase flexibility of choosing memory type (e.g `byte[]`, `int[]`, `long[]`, or `DirectBuffer (offheap)`).\r\n2. Improve runtime performance of memory access instead of using `Object`.\r\n\r\nThis PR can achieve **1.9x performance improvement** of `Read UnsafeArrayData` in [`UnsafeArrayDataBenchmark`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/benchmark/UnsafeArrayDataBenchmark.scala#L42).\r\n\r\nWithout this

Background\r\nIn Spark SQL, partition columns always appear at the end of the schema, even with user-specified schema:\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq(1->1).toDF(\"i\",

(nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, for historical reasons, Spark SQL supports partition columns appearing in data files, and respect the order of partition columns in data schema but pick the value from partition directories:\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq(1->1, 2 -> 1).toDF(\"i\", \"j\").write.parquet(\"/tmp/t/i=1\")\r\n\r\n// You can see the value of column i is always 1, so the value of partition columns are picked\r\n// from partition directories.\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/t\").show\r\n17/10/11 16:28:28 WARN DataSource: Found duplicate column(s) in the data schema and the partition

hive metastore):\r\n```\r\n// With user-specified schema, partition columns are always at the end now.\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"i int, j int\").parquet(\"/tmp/t\").show\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  j|

org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalog.newSparkSQLSpecificMetastoreTable$1(HiveExternalCatalog.scala:299)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason of this bug is, when we respect the order of partition columns in data schema, we will get an invalid table schema which breaks the assumption that partition columns should be at the end.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nMy proposal is: First we should always put partition columns at the end, to have a consistent behavior. Second we should ignore the partitions columns in data files when dealing with tables.\r\n\r\nOne problem is, we don't have corrected data/physical schema in metastore and may fail to read non-self-description file format like CSV. I think this is really a corner case(having overlapped columns in data and partition schema), and the table schema can't have overlapped columns in data and partition schema(unless we hack it into table properties), so we don't have a better choice.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is, for tables created before Spark 2.2, we may already have invalid table schema in metastore.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a stripped down version of the `KubernetesClusterSchedulerBackend` for Spark with the following components:\r\n- Static Allocation of Executors\r\n- Executor Pod Factory\r\n- Executor Recovery Semantics\r\n\r\nIt's step 1 from the step-wise plan documented [here](https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark/issues/441#issuecomment-330802935).\r\nThis addition is covered by the [SPIP vote](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/SPIP-Spark-on-Kubernetes-td22147.html) which passed on Aug 31 .\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- The patch contains unit tests which are passing.\r\n- Manual testing: `./build/mvn -Pkubernetes clean package` succeeded.\r\n- It is a **subset** of the entire changelist hosted in http://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark which is in active use in several organizations.\r\n- There is integration testing enabled in the fork currently [hosted by PepperData](spark-k8s-jenkins.pepperdata.org:8080) which is being moved over

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn EnsureStatefulOpPartitioning, we check that the inputRDD to a SparkPlan has the expected partitioning for Streaming Stateful Operators. The problem is that we are not allowed to access this information during planning.\r\nThe reason we added that check was because CoalesceExec could actually create RDDs with 0 partitions. We should fix it such that when CoalesceExec says that there is a SinglePartition, there is in fact an inputRDD of 1 partition instead of 0 partitions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit getAllBlocks implicitly assumed that the directories\r\nmanaged by the DiskBlockManager contain only the files corresponding to\r\nvalid block IDs. In reality, this assumption was violated during shuffle,\r\nwhich produces temporary files in the same directory as the resulting\r\nblocks. As a result, calls to getAllBlocks during shuffle were unreliable.\r\n\r\nThe fix could be made more efficient, but this is probably good enough.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`DiskBlockManagerSuite`","created_at":"2017-10-09T16:56:40Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T15:06:32Z","closed_at":"2017-10-25T21:18:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03ef9940066b0e4faff7ffd74e15677e8b312aee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19458/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19458/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19458/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2b6134708e1771546c3b2210b9471b51e20d4cd1","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:block-id-option","ref":"block-id-option","sha":"2b6134708e1771546c3b2210b9471b51e20d4cd1","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds a new optimisation rule 'ReplaceExceptWithNotFilter' that replaces Except logical with Filter operator and schedule it before applying 'ReplaceExceptWithAntiJoin' rule. This way we can avoid expensive join operation if one or both of the datasets of the Except operation are fully derived out of Filters from a same parent.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe patch is tested locally using spark-shell + unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-06T19:13:25Z","updated_at":"2017-10-28T12:41:14Z","closed_at":"2017-10-28T01:59:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b821ed1ee4266365f8a11eed9850e5374b6fa2b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19451/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19451/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19451/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/40d8797b1750d8a8814dcdc113fa79a3ab086cf2","head":{"label":"sathiyapk:SPARK-22181-optimize-exceptWithFilter","ref":"SPARK-22181-optimize-exceptWithFilter","sha":"40d8797b1750d8a8814dcdc113fa79a3ab086cf2","user":{"login":"sathiyapk","id":5880194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODAxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk","html_url":"https://github.com/sathiyapk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100880777,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA4ODA3Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"sathiyapk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sathiyapk","id":5880194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODAxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5880194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk","html_url":"https://github.com/sathiyapk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sathiyapk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sathiyapk/spark","description":"Mirror

patch fixes application re-attempts when running spark on yarn using the external shuffle service with security on.  Currently executors will fail to launch on any application re-attempt when launched on a nodemanager that had an executor from the first attempt.  The reason for this is because we aren't updating the secret key after the first application attempt.  The fix here is to just remove the containskey check to see if it already exists. In this way, we always add it and make sure its the most recent secret.  Similarly remove the check for containsKey on the remove since its just adding extra check that isn't really needed.\r\n\r\nNote this worked before spark 2.2 because the check used to be contains (which was looking for the value) rather then containsKey, so that never matched and it was just always adding the new secret.\r\n\r\nPatch was tested on a 10 node cluster as well as added the unit test.\r\nThe test ran was a wordcount where the output directory already existed.  With the bug present the application attempt failed with max number of executor Failures which were all saslExceptions.  With the fix present the application re-attempts fail with directory already exists or when you remove the directory between attempts the re-attemps succeed.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-06T18:58:24Z","updated_at":"2017-10-09T19:59:42Z","closed_at":"2017-10-09T19:59:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5815a074586a8b760805d796407f21ecc851e7c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5a9ef1396a28b535042e336a2f43d80104ce95e5","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-22218","ref":"SPARK-22218","sha":"5a9ef1396a28b535042e336a2f43d80104ce95e5","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ParquetFileFormat` to relax its requirement of output committer class from `org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetOutputCommitter` or subclass thereof (and so implicitly Hadoop `FileOutputCommitter`) to any committer implementing `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.OutputCommitter`\r\n\r\nThis enables output committers which don't write to the filesystem the way `FileOutputCommitter` does to save parquet data from a dataframe: at present you cannot do this.\r\n\r\nBefore a committer which isn't a subclass of `ParquetOutputCommitter`, it checks to see if the context has requested summary metadata by setting `parquet.enable.summary-metadata`. If true, and the committer class isn't a parquet committer, it raises a RuntimeException with an error message.\r\n\r\n(It could downgrade, of course, but raising an exception makes it clear there won't be an summary. It also makes the behaviour testable.)\r\n\r\nNote that `SQLConf` already states that any `OutputCommitter` can be used, but that typically it's a subclass of ParquetOutputCommitter. That's not currently true. This patch will make the code consistent with the docs, adding tests to verify,\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe patch includes a test suite, `ParquetCommitterSuite`, with a new committer, `MarkingFileOutputCommitter` which extends `FileOutputCommitter` and writes a marker file in the destination directory. The presence of the marker file can be used to verify the new committer was used. The tests then try the combinations of Parquet committer summary/no-summary and marking committer summary/no-summary. \r\n\r\n| committer | summary | outcome |\r\n|-----------|---------|---------|\r\n| parquet   | true    | success |\r\n| parquet   | false   | success |\r\n| marking   | false   | success with marker |\r\n| marking   | true    | exception |\r\n\r\nAll tests are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-18016 introduced an arbitrary threshold for the size of a generated class

This value is hardcoded.\r\nIn some cases making it smaller can help avoiding the error of exceeding the maximum number of entries in the Constant Pool.\r\nThis PR introduces a new configuration parameter, which defaults to the previous value, but it allows to set this to a smaller one if needed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR we make a few changes to the list hive partitions code, to make the code more extensible.\r\nThe following changes are made:\r\n1. In `HiveClientImpl.getPartitions()`, call `client.getPartitions` instead of `shim.getAllPartitions` when `spec` is empty;\r\n2. In `HiveTableScanExec`, previously we always call `listPartitionsByFilter` if the config `metastorePartitionPruning` is enabled, but actually, we'd better call `listPartitions` if `partitionPruningPred` is empty;\r\n3.  We should use sessionCatalog instead of SharedState.externalCatalog in `HiveTableScanExec`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by existing test cases since this is code refactor, no regression or behavior change is expected.","created_at":"2017-10-06T11:25:36Z","updated_at":"2017-10-09T06:23:52Z","closed_at":"2017-10-06T19:56:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"625fa643851b95021384f1b2979135a1d7c513a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1e119ea7ae414e27ad0832cee347a20d24f1c0cb","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:hivePartitions","ref":"hivePartitions","sha":"1e119ea7ae414e27ad0832cee347a20d24f1c0cb","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe issue in JIRA: [SPARK-22212](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22212)\r\n\r\nMost of the functions in `pyspark.sql.functions` allow usage of both column name string and `Column` object. But there are some functions, like `trim`, that require to pass only `Column`. See below code for explanation.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import pyspark.sql.functions as func\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([tuple(l) for l in \"abcde\"], [\"text\"])\r\n>>> df.select(func.trim(df[\"text\"])).show()\r\n+----------+\r\n|trim(text)|\r\n+----------+\r\n|         a|\r\n|         b|\r\n|         c|\r\n|         d|\r\n|         e|\r\n+----------+\r\n>>> df.select(func.trim(\"text\")).show()\r\n[...]\r\nPy4JError: An error occurred while calling z:org.apache.spark.sql.functions.trim. Trace:\r\npy4j.Py4JException: Method trim([class java.lang.String]) does not exist\r\n        at py4j.reflection.ReflectionEngine.getMethod(ReflectionEngine.java:318)\r\n        at py4j.reflection.ReflectionEngine.getMethod(ReflectionEngine.java:339)\r\n        at py4j.Gateway.invoke(Gateway.java:274)\r\n        at py4j.commands.AbstractCommand.invokeMethod(AbstractCommand.java:132)\r\n        at py4j.commands.CallCommand.execute(CallCommand.java:79)\r\n        at py4j.GatewayConnection.run(GatewayConnection.java:214)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because most of the Python function calls map column name to `Column` in the Python function mapping, but functions created via `_create_function` pass them as is, if they are not `Column`. On the other hand, few functions that require the column name has been moved `functions_by_column_name`, and are created by `_create_function_by_column_name`.\r\n\r\nNote that this is only Python-side fix. Some Scala functions still do not have method to call them by string column name.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdditional Python tests where written to accommodate this. It was tested via `UnitTest` in IDE and the overall `python\\run_tests` script.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-06T10:40:18Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T14:43:58Z","closed_at":"2017-10-10T14:43:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e682745ddf3624e90a8739aa29c414308b0c6859","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19443/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19443/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19443/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e52c6380ae8787d20e3442cfaf42cfb70caf4dc","head":{"label":"jsnowacki:fix_func_str_to_col","ref":"fix_func_str_to_col","sha":"9e52c6380ae8787d20e3442cfaf42cfb70caf4dc","user":{"login":"jsnowacki","id":1014323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQzMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1014323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki","html_url":"https://github.com/jsnowacki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100690495,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2OTA0OTU=","name":"spark-1","full_name":"jsnowacki/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jsnowacki","id":1014323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQzMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1014323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki","html_url":"https://github.com/jsnowacki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jsnowacki/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current ML attribute API has issues like inefficiency and less scalability. This work proposes new ML attribute API with main changes:\r\n\r\n* Support spark vector-typed attributes.\r\n* Simplify vector-typed attribute serialization.\r\n\r\n### Indices range of attributes\r\n\r\nAttributes which can be included in vector-typed attributes have indices range properties that record the indices that the attributes represent in vectors. For example, if 0 to 2 dimensions in a vector are all numeric attributes with same properties. We can use one numeric attribute recorded with indices range as [0, 2] for the 3 attributes.\r\n\r\n### Sparse vector attributes\r\n\r\nVector attributes represents vector-typed columns. A vector attribute has attributes recorded with indices range in the vector. The indices without attributes are unresolved attributes which won't be serialized and don't occupy memory.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility with current attribute APIs\r\n\r\nThe attributes created using current attribute APIs in metadata of `StructField` can be read and converted to new attributes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests for attribute types. Compatibility tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-06T05:05:43Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:07Z","closed_at":"2017-10-28T00:20:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38a3051cf8800124755b4fc8b633236f3b9733ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/51440b4eeefece4f899a21ef1a0a63399a9f95ac","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-8515","ref":"SPARK-8515","sha":"51440b4eeefece4f899a21ef1a0a63399a9f95ac","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding spark image reader, an implementation of schema for representing images in spark DataFrames\r\n\r\nThe code is taken from the spark package located here:\r\n(https://github.com/Microsoft/spark-images)\r\n\r\nPlease see the JIRA for more information (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21866)\r\n\r\nPlease see mailing list for SPIP vote and approval information:\r\n(http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/VOTE-SPIP-SPARK-21866-Image-support-in-Apache-Spark-td22510.html)\r\n\r\n# Background and motivation\r\nAs Apache Spark is being used more and more in the industry, some new use cases are emerging for different data formats beyond the traditional SQL types or the numerical types (vectors and matrices). Deep Learning applications commonly deal with image processing. A number of projects add some Deep Learning capabilities to Spark (see list below), but they struggle to communicate with each other or with MLlib pipelines because there is no standard way to represent an image in Spark DataFrames. We propose to federate efforts for representing images in Spark by defining a representation that caters to the most common needs of users and library developers.\r\nThis SPIP proposes a specification to represent images in Spark DataFrames and Datasets (based on existing industrial standards), and an interface for loading sources of images. It is not meant to be a full-fledged image processing library, but rather the core description that other libraries and users can rely on. Several packages already offer various processing facilities for transforming images or doing more complex operations, and each has various design tradeoffs that make them better as standalone solutions.\r\nThis project is a joint collaboration between Microsoft and Databricks, which have been testing this design in two open source packages: MMLSpark and Deep Learning Pipelines.\r\nThe proposed image format is an in-memory, decompressed representation that targets low-level applications. It is significantly more liberal in memory usage than compressed image representations such as JPEG, PNG, etc., but it allows easy communication with popular image processing libraries and has no decoding overhead.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in scala ImageSchemaSuite, unit tests in python","created_at":"2017-10-05T17:13:22Z","updated_at":"2017-11-22T23:48:44Z","closed_at":"2017-11-22T23:48:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"baafa904bf79cd9af9f41a5027a815b2409bfdc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19439/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19439/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19439/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a76496be9ebc8b4aba1cd1cd4e3132411649597e","head":{"label":"imatiach-msft:ilmat/spark-images","ref":"ilmat/spark-images","sha":"a76496be9ebc8b4aba1cd1cd4e3132411649597e","user":{"login":"imatiach-msft","id":24683184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgzMTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24683184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/imatiach-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76980395,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Njk4MDM5NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"imatiach-msft/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imatiach-msft","id":24683184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjgzMTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24683184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/imatiach-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imatiach-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imatiach-msft/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently percentile_approx never returns the first element when percentile is in (relativeError, 1/N], where relativeError default 1/10000, and N is the total number of elements. But ideally, percentiles in [0, 1/N] should all return the first element as the answer.\r\n\r\nFor example, given input data 1 to 10, if a user queries 10% (or even less) percentile, it should return 1, because the first value 1 already reaches 10%. Currently it returns 2.\r\n\r\nBased on the paper, targetError is not rounded up, and searching index should start from 0 instead of 1. By following the paper, we should be able to fix the cases mentioned above.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case and fix existing test cases.","created_at":"2017-10-05T15:50:50Z","updated_at":"2017-10-11T18:40:44Z","closed_at":"2017-10-11T07:19:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"195cba6fddcd27b34b447ab8b0c46f96a58182da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11802650c938be59163721254193c67bf3949a99","head":{"label":"wzhfy:improve_percentile_approx","ref":"improve_percentile_approx","sha":"11802650c938be59163721254193c67bf3949a99","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

Background\r\n\r\nIn #18837 , @ArtRand added Mesos secrets support to the dispatcher. **This PR is to add the same secrets support to the drivers.** This means if the secret configs are set, the driver will launch executors that have access to either env or file-based secrets.\r\n\r\nOne use case for this is to support TLS in the driver <=> executor communication.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are a refactor of the dispatcher secrets support (#18837) - moving it to a common place that can be used by both the dispatcher and drivers. The same goes for the unit tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThere are four config combinations: [env or file-based] x [value or reference secret]. For each combination:\r\n- Added a unit test.\r\n- Tested in DC/OS.\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-05T12:20:51Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T17:43:21Z","closed_at":"2017-10-26T23:16:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb2b4bd1f85063435cdd15728829a552f1887258","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/88dfb42bfd794ab1eea969c3b51970e68e4ca407","head":{"label":"d2iq-archive:sh-mesos-driver-secret","ref":"sh-mesos-driver-secret","sha":"88dfb42bfd794ab1eea969c3b51970e68e4ca407","user":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34087729,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4NzcyOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"d2iq-archive/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nThis PR adds local tree training for decision tree regressors as a first step for addressing [SPARK-3162](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3162): train decision trees locally when possible.\r\n\r\nSee [this design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1baU5KeorrmLpC4EZoqLuG-E8sUJqmdELLbr8o6wdbVM/edit) (in particular the [local tree training section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1baU5KeorrmLpC4EZoqLuG-E8sUJqmdELLbr8o6wdbVM/edit#heading=h.eiteb09wxsjf)) for detailed discussion of the proposed changes.\r\n\r\nDistributed training logic has been refactored but only minimally modified; the local tree training implementation leverages existing distributed training logic for computing impurities and splits. This shared logic has been refactored into `...Utils` objects (e.g. `SplitUtils.scala`, `ImpurityUtils.scala`). \r\n\r\n### How to Review\r\n\r\nEach commit in this PR adds non-overlapping functionality, so the PR can be reviewed commit-by-commit.\r\n\r\nChanges introduced by each commit:\r\n1. Adds new data structures for local tree training (`FeatureVector`, `TrainingInfo`)\r\n2. Adds shared utility methods for computing splits/impurities (`SplitUtils`, `ImpurityUtils`, `AggUpdateUtils`), largely copied from existing distributed training code in `RandomForest.scala`.\r\n3. Unit tests for split/impurity utility methods (`TreeSplitUtilsSuite`)\r\n4. Updates distributed training code in `RandomForest.scala` to depend on the utility methods introduced in 2.\r\n5. Adds local tree training logic (`LocalDecisionTree`) \r\n6. Local tree unit/integration tests (`LocalTreeUnitSuite`, `LocalTreeIntegrationSuite`)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNo existing tests were modified. The following new tests were added (also described above):\r\n* Unit tests for new data structures specific to local tree training (`LocalTreeDataSuite`, `LocalTreeUtilsSuite`)\r\n* Unit tests for impurity/split utility methods (`TreeSplitUtilsSuite`)\r\n* Unit tests for local tree training logic (`LocalTreeUnitSuite`)\r\n* Integration tests verifying that local & distributed tree training produce the same trees (`LocalTreeIntegrationSuite`)","created_at":"2017-10-04T22:30:57Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T00:08:21Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T00:08:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fb1d2485269450838650b075130dc0c71a43817","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d86dd18e47451c2e4463c68db441f92a898ac765","head":{"label":"smurching:pr-splitup","ref":"pr-splitup","sha":"d86dd18e47451c2e4463c68db441f92a898ac765","user":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61843831,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTg0MzgzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"smurching/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/smurching/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd `spark.streaming.backpressure.initialRate` to direct Kafka Streams for Kafka 0.8 and 0.10\r\nThis is required in order to be able to use backpressure with huge lags, which cannot be processed at once.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt seems that recovering from a checkpoint can replace the old\r\ndriver and executor IP addresses, as the workload can now be taking\r\nplace in a different cluster configuration. It follows that the\r\nbindAddress for the master may also have changed. Thus we should not be\r\nkeeping the old one, and instead be added to the list of properties to\r\nreset and recreate from the new environment.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested via manual testing on AWS, using the experimental (not yet merged) Kubernetes scheduler, which uses bindAddress to bind to a Kubernetes service (and thus was how I first encountered the bug too), but it is not a code-path related to the scheduler and this may have slipped through when merging SPARK-4563.","created_at":"2017-10-04T11:12:41Z","updated_at":"2017-11-10T19:00:38Z","closed_at":"2017-11-10T19:00:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dcc95296eaa890570d45c027085b4e594eacbb54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/892555f452173b73aeabc077749c4c32a7d4e504","head":{"label":"ssaavedra:fix-checkpointing-master","ref":"fix-checkpointing-master","sha":"892555f452173b73aeabc077749c4c32a7d4e504","user":{"login":"ssaavedra","id":581152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTE1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/581152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra","html_url":"https://github.com/ssaavedra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssaavedra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"64df08b64779bab629a8a90a3797d8bd70f61703","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache Spark -
