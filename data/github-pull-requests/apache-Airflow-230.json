to Helm Chart for Kubernetes tests\r\n    \r\nThe Kubernetes tests are now run using Helm chart\r\nrather than the custom templates we used to have.\r\n    \r\nThe Helm Chart uses locally build production image\r\nso the tests are testing not only Airflow but also\r\nHelm Chart and a Production image - all at the\r\nsame time. Later on we will add more tests\r\ncovering more functionalities of both Helm Chart\r\nand Production Image. This is the first step to\r\nget all of those bundle together and become\r\ntestable.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces also 'shell' sub-command\r\nfor Breeze's kind-cluster command and\r\nEMBEDDED_DAGS build args for production image -\r\nboth of them useful to run the Kubernetes tests\r\nmore easily - without building two images\r\nand with an easy-to-iterate-over-tests\r\nshell command - which works without any\r\nother development environment.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit

is a DRAFT and I still have to complete the missing documentation and unit tests.\r\n\r\nI wanted to prepare a minimal valuable product for the upgrade_check command. Only one rule is implemented, but I think that's enough to show the feature. In the next steps, we can think about what rules we need to create, create tickets, and then work on the next rules by the whole community. \r\n\r\nRecently, we have a lot of new beginner contributors and I think we can try to engage them for this task. Most rules will be small and independent, so they will be great candidates for good-first-issue.\r\n\r\nAn example of the result of this command is presented in the termianlshot below\r\n<img

PR solves the issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/9164\r\nThis PR continues the discussion of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/9165\r\n\r\n**Files changed**: \r\n`airflow/providers/docker/operators/docker.py`\r\n`airflow/providers/docker/example_dags/example_docker_xcom.py`\r\n\r\n**Problems**\r\n\r\n* **Issue 1**: When `xcom_push=True` is enabled (and `xcom_push_all=False`), the output **sometimes is null** OR captured wrongly.\r\n* **Issue 2**: When `xcom_push_all=True` a bytes string (`b'...'`) is stored as xcom, It's harder to use the output on following operators and is not compliant with other operators.\r\n* **Issue 3**: `Stderr` and `stdout` are written to the same output xcom. In practice, we don't want warnings and errors messing up with the code to be parsed on following operators (But we need to capture the output on airflow logs). Sending `stderr` to xcom can lead to undefined/non-deterministic behavior.\r\n\r\n**Solutions**:\r\n\r\n* **Issue 1**:  Refactored the generator, using logs\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            def gen_output(stdout=False, stderr=False):\r\n                return (\r\n                    templ.decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\r\n                    if hasattr(templ, \"decode\")\r\n                    else str(templ)\r\n                    for templ in self.cli.logs(\r\n                        self.container[\"Id\"], stream=True, stdout=stdout, stderr=stderr\r\n                    )\r\n                )\r\n\r\n            for line in gen_output(stdout=True, stderr=True):\r\n                self.log.info(line)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Issue 2**:  I just added:\r\n```python\r\n...\r\n                    templ.decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\r\n                    if hasattr(templ, \"decode\")\r\n                    else str(templ)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Issue 3**:  I store `stdout` into xcom:\r\n```python\r\n           return_value = None\r\n            if self.do_xcom_push:\r\n                lines = gen_output(stdout=True)\r\n                if self.xcom_all:\r\n                    return_value = \"\\n\".join(lines)\r\n                else:\r\n                    line_deque = deque(lines, maxlen=1)\r\n                    return_value = line_deque.pop()\r\n```\r\nIn the end, only logs are send to xcom and if any error is raised, the DAG run fail after finishing:\r\n```python\r\n            result = self.cli.wait(self.container[\"Id\"])\r\n            if result[\"StatusCode\"] != 0:\r\n                raise AirflowException(\"docker container failed: \" + repr(result))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Sample Output**\r\n\r\n* **Issue 1**:\r\n  * Captured correctly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11466701/85225181-db928100-b401-11ea-92a7-5a10d8f30ad6.png)\r\n\r\n`We would expect only the last line '9'`\r\n* **Issue 2**:\r\n  * Easier to pull outputs and use on other operators\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11466701/85225198-07156b80-b402-11ea-91eb-5e63ab874871.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Issue 3**:\r\n  * `Stderr` do not mess up with the output and has deterministic behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11466701/85225301-c0744100-b402-11ea-9393-0ec0bd75a9fa.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of the change\r\n-

this PR fixes an issue with PythonVirtualenvOperator not working in conjunction with airflow context arg.\r\n \r\nRelates to #8177\r\nRelates to #8256 \r\n\r\nBut it also has a QoL improvement. You don't need to manually pass `dill` as requirement anymore if you have set `use_dill` to `True`.

to access dag in Webserver we use global variable `dagbag` from `airflow.www.views`. This global object is also necessary for new Connexion API (/tasks endpoint for example).  \r\n\r\nHowever, it would be better to avoid any coupling between views code and API code. This PR proposes to replace this global object with an attribute of Flask app that can be accessed using `flask.current_app` as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask import current_app\r\n\r\n@expose('/my_endpoint')\r\ndef my_endpoint():\r\n    dag_bag: DagBag = current_app.dag_bag\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR:

crashing webserver after /tmp is mounted from the host\r\n\r\nThe bug was introduced in f17a02d\r\n\r\nGunicorn uses a lot of os.fchmod in /tmp directory and it can create some\r\nexcessive blocking in os.fchmod\r\nhttps://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/faq.html#how-do-i-avoid-gunicorn-excessively-blocking-in-os-fchmod\r\n\r\nWe want to switch to use /dev/shm in prod image (shared memory) to make\r\nblocking go away and make independent on the docker filesystem used (osxfs has\r\nproblems with os.fchmod and use permissions as well).\r\n\r\nThis can be done
