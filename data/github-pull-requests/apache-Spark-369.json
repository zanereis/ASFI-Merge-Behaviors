What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a follow-up of #12934 and #12844. This PR adds a set of utility methods in `DDLUtils` to help extract schema information (user-defined schema, partition columns, and bucketing information) from data source table properties. These utility methods are then used in `DescribeTableCommand` to refine output for data source tables. Before this PR, the aforementioned schema information are only shown as table properties, which are hard to read.\n\nSample

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSparkR 2.0 QA: New R APIs and API docs for mllib.R. Main changes including:\n- Make `spark.glm` and `spark.naiveBayes` API more consistent with Spark naming convention. Because most Spark MLlib algorithms do not override the base R functions, we can make the argument names consistent with Spark MLlib rather than base R. Meanwhile, make the default value to be consistent with MLlib.\n\nFrom:\n\n```\nsetMethod(\"spark.glm\", signature(data = \"SparkDataFrame\", formula = \"formula\"),\n          function(data, formula, family = gaussian, epsilon = 1e-06, maxit = 25) {})\nsetMethod(\"spark.naiveBayes\", signature(data = \"SparkDataFrame\", formula = \"formula\"),\n          function(data, formula, laplace = 0, ...) {})\n```\n\nTo:\n\n```\nsetMethod(\"spark.glm\", signature(data = \"SparkDataFrame\", formula = \"formula\"),\n          function(data, formula, family = gaussian, tol = 1e-06, maxIter = 25) {})\nsetMethod(\"spark.naiveBayes\", signature(data = \"SparkDataFrame\", formula = \"formula\"),\n          function(data, formula, smoothing = 1.0, ...) {}) \n```\n- Refactor the structure of mllib.R, and it will make developers and contributors understand code more clearly.\n\n```\nspark.glm, glm, summary, predict\nspark.survreg, summary, predict\nspark.naiveBayes, summary, predict\nspark.kmeans, summary, fitted, predit\nwrite.ml, read.ml\n```\n- Remove duplicated test code in test_mllib.R. Because `glm` internally will call `spark.glm` to train model, we should not duplicate all `spark.glm` tests twice and just run the basic test case to check the API working well. \n- Fix and update docs.\n- Formatting code.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n1. Fix code style  \n2. remove volatile of elementsRead method because there is only one thread to use it.\n3. avoid volatile of _elementsRead because Collection increases number of  _elementsRead when it insert a element. It is very expensive. So we can avoid it.\n\nAfter this PR, I will push another PR for branch 1.6.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSPARK-15241: We now support java decimal and catalyst decimal in external row, it makes sense to also support scala decimal.\n\nSPARK-15242: This is a long-standing bug, and is exposed after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12364, which eliminate the `If` expression if the field is not nullable:\n\n```\nval fieldValue = serializerFor(\n  GetExternalRowField(inputObject, i, externalDataTypeForInput(f.dataType)),\n  f.dataType)\nif (f.nullable) {\n  If(\n    Invoke(inputObject, \"isNullAt\", BooleanType, Literal(i) :: Nil),\n    Literal.create(null, f.dataType),\n    fieldValue)\n} else {\n  fieldValue\n}\n```\n\nPreviously, we always use `DecimalType.SYSTEM_DEFAULT` as the output type of converted decimal field, which is wrong as it doesn't match the real decimal type. However, it works well because we always put converted field into `If` expression to do the null check, and `If` use its `trueValue`'s data type as its output type.\nNow if we have a not nullable decimal field, then the converted field's output type will be `DecimalType.SYSTEM_DEFAULT`, and we will write wrong data into unsafe row.\n\nThe fix is simple, just use the given decimal type as the output type of converted decimal field.\n\nThese 2 issues was found at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13008\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in RowEncoderSuite\n","created_at":"2016-05-10T03:49:32Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T18:18:09Z","closed_at":"2016-05-11T18:18:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"efaef1d2636a9b3767171b829e7bbeacafc2996c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2c77ca477863c0cff7afb91609905d6eab09c7b","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:encoder-decimal","ref":"encoder-decimal","sha":"a2c77ca477863c0cff7afb91609905d6eab09c7b","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe do serialization/deserialization on aggregation buffer in `TungstenAggregate` for each aggregation function. It wastes time on duplicate serde for the same grouping keys.\n\nInstead of deserializing elements from aggregation buffer, updating the variables then serializing it back, we can use the same variables for the same grouping keys and only serializing it back when it is needed to change grouping keys.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTo extract job descriptions and stage name, there are following regular expressions in timeline-view.js\n\n```\nvar jobIdText =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nOur case sensitivity support is different from what ANSI SQL standards support. Postgres' behavior is that if an identifier is quoted, then it is treated as case sensitive; otherwise it is folded to lowercase. We will likely need to revisit this in the future and change our behavior. For now, the safest change to do for Spark 2.0 is to make the case sensitive option internal and discourage users from turning it on, effectively making Spark always case insensitive.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A - a small config documentation change.\n","created_at":"2016-05-09T18:55:18Z","updated_at":"2016-05-10T03:04:16Z","closed_at":"2016-05-10T03:04:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3e0f9611898441a62a9c0f01e7d2115c3f08967","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c50fdf49519f093f7b146028b7b969c9965238d6","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-15229","ref":"SPARK-15229","sha":"c50fdf49519f093f7b146028b7b969c9965238d6","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n- Since Spark has supported native csv reader, it does not necessary to use the third party `spark-csv` in `examples/src/main/r/data-manipulation.R`. Meanwhile, remove all `spark-csv` usage in SparkR.\n- Running R applications through `sparkR` is not supported as of Spark 2.0, so we change to use `./bin/spark-submit` to run the example.\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes an escaping bug in the Web UI's event timeline that caused Javascript errors when displaying timeline entries whose descriptions include single quotes. \n\nThe original bug can be reproduced by running\n\n``` scala\nsc.setJobDescription(\"double quote: \\\" \")\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10).count()\n\nsc.setJobDescription(\"single quote: ' \")\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10).count() \n```\n\nand then browsing to the driver UI. Previously, this resulted in an \"Uncaught SyntaxError\" because the single quote from the description was not escaped and ended up closing a Javascript string literal too early.\n\nThe fix implemented here is to change the relevant Javascript to define its string literals using double-quotes. Our escaping logic already properly escapes double quotes in the description, so this is safe to do.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually in `spark-shell` using the following cases:\n\n``` scala\nsc.setJobDescription(\"double quote: \\\" \")\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10).count()\n\nsc.setJobDescription(\"single quote: ' \")\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10).count() \n\nsc.setJobDescription(\"ampersand: &\")\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10).count()\n\nsc.setJobDescription(\"newline: \\n text after newline \")\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10).count() \n\nsc.setJobDescription(\"carriage return: \\r text after return \")\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10).count() \n```\n\n/cc @sarutak for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn a `HiveSessionState`, which is a given `SparkSession` backed by Hive, the analysis should not be case sensitive because the underlying Hive Metastore is case insensitive. \n\nFor example, \n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE tab1 (C1 int);\nSELECT C1 FROM tab1\n```\n\nIn the current implementation, we will get the following error because the column name is always stored in lower case. \n\n```\ncannot resolve '`C1`' given input columns: [c1]; line 1 pos 7\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '`C1`' given input columns: [c1]; line 1 pos 7\n```\n\nThis PR is to always use case insensitive analysis in `HiveSessionState`, no matter whether users set `spark.sql.caseSensitive` to true or false. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded the related  test cases.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nReading codegen output is important for developers to debug. So far, outputting codegen results is available in the SQL interface by `EXPLAIN CODEGEN`. However, in the Dataset/DataFrame APIs, we face the same issue. \n\nThis PR is to add a new Dataset API `explainCodegen` for achieving the same purpose. \n\nBTW, I also tried another way, i.e., adding a new boolean parameter into the existing `explain` API. However, if users set both `extended` and `codegen` to `true`, we only output the `codegen` results to the console. Basically, that is not allowed. We need to issue an exception in that case? Or change the behavior? Output both results in this case? Anyway, I am also fine if this is preferred. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nSince `explainCodegen` is writing the result to the console, I only do the manual testing in my local environment. For example, the test case:\n\n``` scala\n  test(\"explainCodegen\") {\n    val ds = Seq(\"a\" -> 1, \"a\" -> 3, \"b\" -> 3).toDS().groupByKey(_._1).agg(\n      expr(\"avg(_2)\").as[Double],\n      ComplexResultAgg.toColumn)\n    ds.explainCodegen()\n  }\n```\n","created_at":"2016-05-08T21:09:13Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T19:54:59Z","closed_at":"2016-05-09T19:54:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2facc70bca515be9d48b0ec7d0035a47bc1ead9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f716b106ede5f090c12e261d64ac5fb4ae0af8a4","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:explainCodeGen","ref":"explainCodeGen","sha":"f716b106ede5f090c12e261d64ac5fb4ae0af8a4","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, Java Linter is disabled in Jenkins tests.\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/dev/run-tests.py#L554\n\nHowever, as of today, Spark has 721 java files with 97362 code (without blank/comments). It's about 1/3 of Scala.\n\n```\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLanguage                      files          blank        comment           code\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScala                          2353          62819         124060         318747\nJava                            721          18617          23314          97362\n```\n\nThis PR aims to take advantage of Travis CI to handle the following static analysis by adding a single file, `.travis.yml` without any additional burden on the existing servers.\n- Java Linter\n- JDK7/JDK8 maven compile\n\nNote that this PR does not propose to remove some of the above work items from the Jenkins. It's possible, but we need to observe the Travis CI stability for a while. The main goal of this issue is to remove committer's overhead on linter-related PRs (the original PR and the fixation PR).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Travis CI tests. Please see the following

Symptom:\n\nIn the latest **branch 1.6**, when a `DISTINCT` aggregation function is used in the `HAVING` clause, Analyzer throws `AnalysisException` with a message like following:\n\n```\nresolved attribute(s) gid#558,id#559 missing from date#554,id#555 in operator !Expand [List(date#554, null, 0, if ((gid#558 = 1)) id#559 else null),List(date#554, id#555, 1, null)], [date#554,id#561,gid#560,if ((gid = 1)) id else null#562];\n```\n#### Root cause:\n\nThe problem is that the distinct aggregate in having condition are resolved by the rule `DistinctAggregationRewriter` twice, which messes up the resulted `EXPAND` operator. \n\nIn a `ResolveAggregateFunctions` rule, when resolving `Filter(havingCondition, _: Aggregate)`, the `havingCondition` is resolved as an `Aggregate` in a nested loop of analyzer rule execution (by invoking `RuleExecutor.execute`). At this nested level of analysis, the rule `DistinctAggregationRewriter` rewrites this distinct aggregate clause to an expanded two-layer aggregation, where the `aggregateExpresssions` of the final `Aggregate` contains the resolved `gid` and the aggregate expression attributes (In the above case, they are  `gid#558, id#559`).  \n\nAfter completion of the nested analyzer rule execution, the resulted `aggregateExpressions` in the `havingCondition` is pushed down into the underlying `Aggregate` operator. The `DistinctAggregationRewriter` rule is executed again. The `projections` field of `EXPAND` operator is populated with the `aggregateExpressions` of the `havingCondition` mentioned above. However, the attributes (In the above case, they are `gid#558, id#559`) in the projection list of `EXPAND` operator can not be found in the underlying relation.\n#### Solution:\n\nThis PR retrofits part of [#11579](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11579) that moves the `DistinctAggregationRewriter` to the beginning of Optimizer, so that it guarantees that the rewrite only happens after all the aggregate functions are resolved first. Thus, it avoids resolution failure. \n#### How is the PR change tested\n\nNew [test cases ](https://github.com/xwu0226/spark/blob/f73428f94746d6d074baf6702589545bdbd11cad/sql/hive/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/execution/AggregationQuerySuite.scala#L927-L988) are added to drive `DistinctAggregationRewriter` rewrites for multi-distinct aggregations , involving having clause. \n\nA following up PR will be submitted to add these test cases to master(2.0) branch.

boolean types. So, this was tested first.\n\nThis PR adds the support for pushing filters down for `BooleanType` in ORC data source.\n\nThis PR also removes `OrcTableScan` class and the companion object, which is not used anymore.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnittest in `OrcFilterSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs mentioned in :\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12836#issuecomment-217338855\nWe would like to create a wrapper for: dapply(repartiition(col,...), ... )\nThis will allow to run aggregate functions on groups which are identified by a list of grouping columns.\n\nI called the wrapper method gapply. We can rename it if we want to call it differently.\nWe could also have:\n`setMethod(\"dapply\", signature(x = \"SparkDataFrame\", func = \"function\", schema = \"structType\", col = \"Column\"),` , however, dapply already has many examples in the doc and if we add new examples for aggregate functions that will make the documentation longer and less clear.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nwhile experimenting with structure streaming. I found that mode() is used for non-continuous queries while outputMode() is used for continuous queries.\nouputMode is not defined, so I have written the some raw implementation and test cases just to make sure the streaming app works \n\nNote:-\n/*\\* Start a query */\n  private[sql] def startQuery(\n      name: String,\n      checkpointLocation: String,\n      df: DataFrame,\n      sink:

before triggerClock, the constructor with  outputMode defined will be used more often then triggerClock.\nI have added triggerClock() method also \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nusing unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch tries to add the support of subexpression elimination in wholestage codegen `Fliter`.\n\nBecause the predicate expressions are evaluated in `Filter` with an optimized ordering that reduces unnecessary evaluation as much as possible, we follow this ordering when doing subexpression elimination too.\n\nDue to that, we can't just extract all common subexpressions and evaluate them first. Instead, we extract common subexpressions but don't evaluate them. We evaluate common subexpressions only when the predicate expressions containing them are evaluated.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-06T14:32:25Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:31Z","closed_at":"2016-10-06T02:42:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b40fd4b386520f71963453c967c44471131689d8","head":{"label":"viirya:subexpr-filter","ref":"subexpr-filter","sha":"b40fd4b386520f71963453c967c44471131689d8","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe official TPC-DS 41 query currently fails because it contains a scalar subquery with a disjunctive correlated predicate (the correlated predicates were nested in ORs). This makes the `Analyzer` pull out the entire predicate which is wrong and causes the following (correct) analysis exception: `The correlated scalar subquery can only contain equality predicates`\n\nThis PR fixes this by first simplifing (or normalizing) the correlated predicates before pulling them out of the subquery.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual testing on TPC-DS 41, and added a test to SubquerySuite.\n","created_at":"2016-05-06T13:56:25Z","updated_at":"2016-05-07T04:07:53Z","closed_at":"2016-05-07T04:07:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c3c67959e15fb34714dc070bfc7f58bd74f4ccd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e28bbb6c90aef0a17caab5db8072327fcf93e59d","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-15122","ref":"SPARK-15122","sha":"e28bbb6c90aef0a17caab5db8072327fcf93e59d","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes two issues that cause the data corruption bug in [SPARK-15112](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15112):\n1. `Dataset.schema` should comform to `Dataset.resolvedTEncoder.schema` rather than the schema of the underlying logical plan\n   \n   An `ExpressionEncoder` doesn't require input column order to be the same as column order of its own schema. Essentially, it performs a projection to adjust column order at runtime. This is particularly useful for data sources that support schema evolution, in which cases column order of the merged result schema can be non-deterministic.\n   \n   Please refer to [this JIRA comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15112?focusedCommentId=15271025&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15271025) for more details.\n2. Optimization rule `EmbedSerializerInFilter` may produce wrong output column order.\n   \n   This PR fixes this issue by adding a `Project` to adjust output column order when necessary.\n   \n   Please
