[KIP-875](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-875%3A+First-class+offsets+support+in+Kafka+Connect))\r\n- However, the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_administration docs section that talks about various connector states wasn't updated. This patch updates that section to add information on the new stopped state (and comparison to the older paused state).\r\n- The wording is mostly borrowed from https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13657. Note that differences regarding offsets modification (possible only in the stopped state, not paused) ~haven't been added since this patch should ideally be backported to `3.5` where the offsets modification endpoints do not exist~ - this has been added to `3.6` and `trunk`, but not `3.5`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

pull request implements the server-side functionality for regex subscriptions in the next generation of the consumer rebalance protocol.\r\n\r\nFor the ConsumerGroupHeartbeat API, the server now accepts a regex pattern, and a constraint is enforced that only one of either the regular subscription pattern or topic name subscription is allowed. The subscribedTopicRegex is eventually transformed into subscribedTopicName in the ConsumerGroupMember.\r\n\r\nTo handle this, an additional argument, TopicsImage, is introduced in the maybeUpdateSubscribedTopicNames() function. This argument is used to filter the topics that match the regex pattern. During replay, when the function is called with a null TopicsImage argument, the regex expression is not considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

will allow enabling and disabling transaction verification (KIP-890 part 1) without having to roll the cluster. \r\n\r\nTested that restarting the cluster persists the configuration.\r\n\r\nIf a verification is disabled/enabled while we have an inflight request, depending on the step of the process, the change may or may not be seen in the inflight request (enabling will typically fail unverified requests, but we may still verify and reject when we first disable) Subsequent requests/retries will behave as expected for verification.\r\n\r\nSequence checks will continue to take place after disabling until the first message is written to the partition (thus clearing the verification entry with the tentative sequence) or the broker restarts/partition is reassigned which will clear the memory. On enabling, we will only track sequences that for requests received after the verification is enabled. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

patch adds the MemberId and the MemberEpoch fields to the OffsetFetchRequest. Those fields will be populated when the new consumer group protocol is used to ensure that the member fetching the offset has the correct member id and epoch. If it does not, UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID or STALE_MEMBER_EPOCH are returned to the client.\r\n\r\nOur initial idea was to implement the same for the old protocol. The field is called GenerationIdOrMemberEpoch in KIP-848 to materialize this. As a second though, I think that we should only do it for the new protocol. The effort to implement it in the old protocol is not worth it in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds unit test to test the new code. I will add integration tests in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

block cache metrics are being multiplied by the total number of column families. In a `RocksDBTimestampedStore`, we have 2 column families (the default, and the timestamped values), which causes all block cache metrics in these stores to become doubled.\r\n\r\nThe cause is that our metrics recorder uses `getAggregatedLongProperty` to fetch block cache metrics. `getAggregatedLongProperty` queries the property on each column family in the database, and sums the results.\r\n\r\nSince we always configure all column families to share the same block cache, that causes the same block cache to be queried multiple times for its metrics, with the results added togehter, effectively multiplying the real value by the total number of column families.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we should simply use `getLongProperty`, which queries a single column family (the default one). Since all column families share the same block cache, querying just one of them will give us the correct metrics for that shared block cache.\r\n\r\nNote: the same block cache is shared among all column families of a store irrespective of whether the user has configured a shared block cache across multiple stores.","created_at":"2023-08-31T11:22:02Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T03:24:30Z","closed_at":"2023-09-18T09:09:10Z","merged_at":"2023-09-18T09:09:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"f041efa5fd82d6a435be80481e40a7bfcd56ed19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14317/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14317/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14317/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9b44f7222f7af1f6510c6112b775f8fad7ecedf6","head":{"label":"nicktelford:KAFKA-13973","ref":"KAFKA-13973","sha":"9b44f7222f7af1f6510c6112b775f8fad7ecedf6","user":{"login":"nicktelford","id":548378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford","html_url":"https://github.com/nicktelford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439367730,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjA4Mg","name":"kafka","full_name":"nicktelford/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nicktelford","id":548378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford","html_url":"https://github.com/nicktelford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nicktelford/kafka","description":"Mirror

measure to address the change in behavior described in [KAFKA-15090](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15090), where the Connect runtime began invoking `SourceTask::stop` on the poll-convert-produce thread instead of on a separate thread.

Instead, we can explore this change first and, only if necessary, explore follow-up measures afterward.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

restores previous behavior for `Admin::listOffsets`, which was to fail immediately if topic metadata could not be found, and only retry if metadata for one or more specific partitions could not be found.\r\n\r\nThere is a subtle difference here: prior to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13432, the operation would be retried if any metadata error was reported for any individual topic partition, even if an error was also reported for the entire topic. With this change, the operation always fails if an error is reported for the entire topic, even if an error is also reported for one or more individual topic partitions.\r\n\r\nI am not aware of any cases where brokers might return both topic- and topic partition-level errors for a metadata request, and if there are none, then this change should be safe. However, if there are such cases, we may need to refine this PR to remove the discrepancy in behavior.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

some fairly subtle behavior involved here, so apologies in advance for the wall of text.\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\nIn the `retryEndOffsetsShouldRetryWhenTopicNotFound` test case, we currently use a `MockTime` object that has an auto-tick of 10ms with our [AdminClientUnitTestEnv](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/703e1d9faafbf07795261b3233ab985583f17fcb/clients/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClientUnitTestEnv.java), which ends up also being utilized by the [admin client](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/703e1d9faafbf07795261b3233ab985583f17fcb/clients/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClientUnitTestEnv.java#L107-L109) that it provides.\r\n\r\nBy default, admin clients perform periodic metadata refresh every five minutes (see the [metadata.max.age.ms property](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/703e1d9faafbf07795261b3233ab985583f17fcb/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/AdminClientConfig.java#L137)). With a `MockTime` instance that has an auto-tick of 10ms, periodic metadata refresh will be triggered every 30,000 times that `MockTime::milliseconds` (or `MockTime::nanoseconds`, but that's not relevant to these tests) is called.\r\n\r\nBecause of how the testing admin is set up by the `AdminClientUnitTestEnv` class, [checks for periodic metadata refresh](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/703e1d9faafbf07795261b3233ab985583f17fcb/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/KafkaAdminClient.java#L1359-L1368) take place in a tight loop with no time spent sleeping during each iteration. As a result, it's not unreasonable for 30,000 iterations to take place fairly quickly.\r\n\r\nWhen a periodic metadata refresh is triggered, it can sometimes \"swallow\" the responses that we [prepare for the admin client](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/703e1d9faafbf07795261b3233ab985583f17fcb/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/util/TopicAdminTest.java#L563-L565), causing these responses to be delivered to the periodic metadata refresh request instead of requests that the admin client issues in service of application logic (e.g., an invocation of `Admin::listOffsets`).\r\n\r\nAs a brief refresher on admin client behavior, when servicing a call to `Admin::listOffsets`, on the happy path, two broker requests are made: the first is a metadata request for the specified topic partitions, and the second is a request for the actual offset info of the requested topic partitions.\r\n\r\nWith the current `TopicAdminTest::retryEndOffsetsShouldRetryWhenTopicNotFound` case, this can lead to a variety of timing-dependent failures:\r\n\r\n- If every prepared response is swallowed, a spurious timeout is caused by repeated attempts to contact a node that never responds because all prepared responses have already been consumed, with every attempt causing the mocked time to move forward slowly but surely past the operation timeout\r\n- If two prepared responses are swallowed before `Admin::listOffsets` is invoked, a `ClassCastException` is thrown because the metadata request issued in service of the call to `Admin::listOffsets` receives the response prepared for the list offsets request, and the admin (somewhat reasonably) [expects the response for that metadata request to be a `MetadataResponse` instance](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/703e1d9faafbf07795261b3233ab985583f17fcb/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/PartitionLeaderStrategy.java#L144)\r\n- If a single response is swallowed, the test passes, but the test is rendered ineffective since the retry logic it intends to verify is never actually covered\r\n\r\n# Solutions\r\n\r\nThere are a few options for a fix:\r\n\r\n1. Disable periodic metadata refresh in the admin client\r\n1. Disable auto-tick in our `MockTime` instance\r\n1. Switch to a fully-deterministic mocking method for the admin client (e.g., use Mockito to construct a mock `Admin` instance)\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've opted for the second option, as this appears to be (implicitly or explicitly) the strategy used in all other tests that use the `AdminClientUnitTestEnv` class, and I'd prefer not to introduce inconsistency in the strategies we use in the `TopicAdminTest` suite to mock out admin client behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other changes\r\n\r\n## Test retryEndOffsetsShouldWrapNonRetriableExceptionsWithConnectException\r\n\r\nThis PR also tweaks the `retryEndOffsetsShouldWrapNonRetriableExceptionsWithConnectException` test case to prevent false negatives. Currently, because of a resurfacing of [KAFKA-12879](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12879), admin clients will retry attempts to list offsets on unknown topics. The test expects the opposite behavior, but because the next automatic retry is met with a spurious timeout, it fails anyways.\r\n\r\nThe test is modified here to 1) prepare a different failure (authorization error) that is less likely to be be treated as retriable by future changes, 2) prepare a valid response for the admin client in the event that it ever retries the operation (which should, conversely, cause the test to fail), and 3) make finer-grained assertions on the kind of exception thrown by `TopicAdmin::retryEndOffsets` to ensure that it fails for the reason that we expect it to.\r\n\r\n## TopicAdmin::retryEndOffsets and TopicAdmin::endOffsets\r\n\r\nA few tweaks are made to these methods to eliminate unnecessary chained elements in the stack trace of exceptions they throw. This not only facilitates the stronger testing assertions added to `TopicAdminTest::retryEndOffsetsShouldWrapNonRetriableExceptionsWithConnectException`, it also improves the readability of the stack traces shown to users.\r\n\r\nThis same improvement may be made to other parts of the `TopicAdmin` class. I've left that for follow-up work to try to keep this PR focused for now, but can add it if we agree it's warranted.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13328), [Jira 2](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13329)\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14304\r\n\r\nAlthough the `Converter` and `HeaderConverter` interfaces both include methods to provide a `ConfigDef` object, we don't make use of them during preflight configuration validation. This makes Kafka Connect harder to use with, among other things, programmatic UIs that perform automatic validation as soon as users enter in new key/value pairs. Additionally, it causes errors in configuration to surface at runtime (after rebalances have taken place and while tasks are being instantiated), which is less convenient for all users.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses these `ConfigDef` objects for preflight validation if the user specifies a custom key, value, and/or header converter class in their connector config. If a key, value, or header converter returns a null `ConfigDef`, we simply log a warning. Although this is technically disallowed by the `Converter` and `HeaderConverter` API, because we have not been enforcing that requirement up til now, we permit that case in order to not break existing setups.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

KIP-919: Allow AdminClient to Talk Directly with the KRaft Controller Quorum and add Controller Registration. This KIP adds a new version of DescribeClusterRequest which is supported by KRaft controllers. It also teaches AdminClient how to use this new DESCRIBE_CLUSTER request to talk directly with the controller quorum. This is all gated behind a new MetadataVersion, IBP_3_7_IV0.\r\n\r\nIn order to share the DESCRIBE_CLUSTER logic between broker and controller, this PR factors it out into AuthHelper.computeDescribeClusterResponse.\r\n\r\nThe KIP adds three new errors codes: MISMATCHED_ENDPOINT_TYPE, UNSUPPORTED_ENDPOINT_TYPE, and UNKNOWN_CONTROLLER_ID. The endpoint type errors can be returned from DescribeClusterRequest\r\n\r\nOn the controller side, the controllers now try to register themselves with the current active controller, by sending a CONTROLLER_REGISTRATION request. This, in turn, is converted into a RegisterControllerRecord by the active controller. ClusterImage, ClusterDelta, and all other associated classes have been upgraded to propagate the new metadata. In the metadata shell, the cluster directory now contains both broker and controller subdirectories.\r\n\r\nQuorumFeatures previously had a reference to the ApiVersions structure used by the controller's NetworkClient. Because this PR removes that reference, QuorumFeatures now contains only immutable data. Specifically, it contains the current node ID, the locally supported features, and the list of quorum node IDs in the cluster.","created_at":"2023-08-29T05:54:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T15:25:24Z","closed_at":"2023-09-07T22:21:53Z","merged_at":"2023-09-07T22:21:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"41b695b6e30baa4243d9ca4f359b833e17ed0e77","assignee":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9a73f7bed8f8b20e588ac76b61469388c116d0a2","head":{"label":"cmccabe:cmccabe_kip_919","ref":"cmccabe_kip_919","sha":"9a73f7bed8f8b20e588ac76b61469388c116d0a2","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":""

1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13328), [Jira 2](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13329)\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14303\r\n\r\nAdds preflight validation checks for key, value, and header converter classes specified in connector configurations. For each converter type, these checks verify that:\r\n- The class has a public, no-args constructor\r\n- The class can be instantiated without an exception being thrown\r\n- The class is not abstract\r\n- - In this case, a list of possible child classes is provided in a user-friendly error message\r\n- The class implements the expected interface\r\n\r\nThere are two components to the linked Jira tickets: this validation (which is fairly straightforward), and more sophisticated logic that leverages `ConfigDef` objects provided by these plugin classes. For ease of review, I'm planning on filing two PRs for these tickets, but instead of grouping by ticket (which would include all key/value converter changes in one ticket and all header converter changes in another), I think it might be easier to group by the kind of validation we're performing. If that's acceptable, the next PR will add `ConfigDef`-based validation for key, value, and header converters.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

JIRA ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7504\r\n- This is a long standing issue in current Kafka architecture that calling `FileChannel.transferTo` (which calls sendfile syscall in Linux) in network threads for zero-copy file sending\r\n  * When a file about to be sent is not on OS page cache, sendfile will block and potentially disturbing all other requests/responses multiplexed on the same thread, leads to significant performance degradation\r\n- This PR adds a logic to warm-up page cache on request handler threads to make sure the file can be served from cache when calling sendfile on network threads\r\n  * This is done by calling sendfile with setting destination to `/dev/null`\r\n- FYI: This patch is running in our production Kafka clusters for years without problems\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-25T05:52:20Z","updated_at":"2025-02-02T03:35:26Z","closed_at":"2025-02-02T03:35:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrao","id":132330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":970614414,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzA2MTQ0MTQ="

integration tests to validate some common scenarios for both the connectors.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

MirrorConnectorsIntegrationBaseTest and derived tests delete all of the topics after the test is complete, but before the EmbeddedConnectCluster (and EmbeddedKafkaCluster) are stopped. If a topic is deleted before the source task can stop (usually the MirrorHeartbeatTask), the task will get stuck and eventually be cancelled. The worker itself also appears to get stuck on accesses to the internal topics, which must time out before the worker will stop.\r\n\r\nThis has the effect of making the test runtime inconsistent, and sometimes extremely slow. With this patch applied and a very small sample size, I saw speedups of up to 8x for individual test methods, and ~2x for the suite overall. On my machine a single suite is now <5 minutes and `connect:mirror:test` completes in <10 minutes.\r\n\r\nBecause the EmbeddedConnectCluster is created fresh in the startClusters command, deleting the topics has no effect on the behavior of the tests, only the time it takes to clean them up. We can just eliminate the deletion step completely, and discard the contents of the topics by discarding the whole EmbeddedKafkaCluster instance.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Context\r\n\r\nMirrorMaker2 dedicated mode was changed in KIP-710 to forward task reconfiguration and zombie fence requests to the leader. It was not changed to perform the same forwarding for connector configurations.\r\n\r\nIn dedicated mode, the MirrorMaker driver class will start up it's local herders, and then reconfigure all of the connectors based on it's on-disk configuration. When performing a slow-paced rolling update, a MirrorMaker node will not join the group as the leader, and will then be unable to write new connector configurations. This leads to the running configurations not reflecting the on-disk configurations after the on-disk configurations are changed.\r\n\r\nIn order to perform forwarding of the connector configurations, use the HerderRequestHandler in the MirrorMaker to forward configurations to a new `/connectors/<connector>/config` endpoint to the `InternalMirrorResource`. This shares it's implementation with the original `ConnectorsResource`.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to be a minimal patch that could be merged in time for the upcoming release. I tried to clean it up to avoid increasing the visibility of certain methods, or to re-use the `namespacedUrl` function, but the refactors ended up ballooning the scope of the fix. I want to address those refactors in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### Behavior summary\r\nThe running connector configurations in dedicated mode are from the worker that:\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\n*  First became the leader after a cold-start\r\n\r\nImplemented in this PR:\r\n*  Most recently started (either in a cold-start or rolling-restart)\r\n\r\nRejected alternative:\r\n*  Most recently became the
