now, we define concurrency groups as `${{ github.workflow }} @ ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.label || github.head_ref || github.ref }}`. This means that for each workflow, if all workflows for a PR will be in a group, and all non-PR runs against the same branch will be in a group. Since each commit in a group cancels all previous runs for that group, the outcome is that all commits against master cancel all previous runs of workflows against master, often meaning that we never actually complete a run against master (or at least don't for a while).\r\n\r\nThis updates concurrency groups to be `${{ github.workflow }} @ ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.label || github.sha || github.head_ref || github.ref }}-${{ github.event.sender.login }}-${{ github.event.schedule }}`\r\n\r\nBasically, this means for each workflow, there will be a different concurrency group:\r\n1) Per pull request (`github.event.pull_request.head.label`)\r\n2) Per commit not on a pull request (`github.sha`)\r\n3) Per commit/user combo if keyed off of workflow_dispatch (`github.event.sender.login`)\r\n4) Per commit in a scheduled workflow (`github.event.schedule`)\r\n\r\nThis will significantly increase the number of runs we're doing, but will ensure we are actually getting all the validation we need. If needed, we can up our worker pool size\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

I'm a security engineer at Spotify and am assisting the maintainers of our [Scio](https://github.com/spotify/scio) project with resolving several security vulnerabilities. Scio maintains version parity with Beam and would like your blessing in upgrading the following to ensure continued compatibility.\r\n\r\n- Hadoop 2.10.2 -> ~3.3.6~ 3.2.4 (changed to 3.2.4 to sync w/ rest of components using Hadoop 3) (Per [BEAM-8569](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8569), Hadoop 3 should be compatible).\r\n- Spark 3.2.2 -> 3.4.1 (Spark [migration guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/core-migration-guide.html) doesn't mention any changes that seem to impact beam).\r\n\r\nFor compatibility validation, I ran the Java test suites mentioned in the [Contribution Testing Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Contribution+Testing+Guide). Please let me know if any additional checks need to be ran before this can get merged in.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a switch to prepare for Arm64 support against Google Cloud Dataflow, via machine type specification.\r\n\r\nThis change adds an additional option for supporting arbitrary architectures for the automatic cross compile which is necessary for adding testing against the service. See https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26902 and 27311.\r\n\r\nFixes debug message parameter ordering on the cross compile.\r\n\r\nA subsequent change should have a more general flag for users who want to automatically cross compile to target other machines. This should be added to JobOpts. End users can continue to work around this by building their own worker binary and setting the --worker_binary flag when submitting a job, per https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/go-cross-compilation/. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

bug was found by a user jumping from Python 3.10 to Python 3.11 failing a parameterized generic type check improperly. The root cause seems to be a lack of support for the PEP-585 types.GenericAlias class, which was not being treated as a typing generic by the type hinting code. This corrects that issue and adds a unit test case that reproduced the original issue.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, releasing a multi_process_shared object that exists in a different process fails. There were actually 2 issues I ran into debugging this:\r\n\r\n1) The first fix you'll see is more specific to some older python environments. Some environments have a version of AutoProxy that doesn't know how to handle the manager_owned kwarg which is passed in by the multiprocessing library as part of this flow. To work around this, I added a patched version that can handle that arg.\r\n\r\n2) The releasing logic was wrong. Specifically, we weren't properly registering the `singletonProxy_release` so that it was discoverable across processes, and we were passing in the wrapped proxy object to call this instead of the actual real proxy object. I updated both of these.\r\n\r\nFixes #27602\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[Neo4j Flex Template for GCP Dataflow](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/tree/main/v2/googlecloud-to-neo4j) currently duplicates what Apache Beam's Neo4jIO provides.\r\n\r\nMost of the logic is indeed duplicated and moving to the battle-tested Neo4jIO is a prerequisite for the Neo4j Flex template to graduate to an official template.\r\n\r\nThere are mainly two differences between the two projects.\r\n\r\nThe template's write unwind transform returns a `PCollection<Row>`, so that it can be waited on, whereas Neo4jIO's write unwind transform is terminal (and return a `PDone`).\r\n\r\nMoreover, the template allows users to specify how much in parallel a node or edge import runs, leveraged by a custom [KV transform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/blob/main/v2/googlecloud-to-neo4j/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/teleport/v2/neo4j/transforms/CreateKvTransform.java).\r\nAfter discussing with @bvolpato, it turns out Apache Beam already provides an equivalent functionality with `Reshuffle.AssignShardFn`.\r\n\r\nThis PR aligns the two implementations and would unblock the integration of Neo4jIO into Neo4j's Flex Template.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-21T14:48:29Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T14:17:49Z","closed_at":"2024-02-12T14:17:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02324188f2c54109b821e3bb07ee641b38e79266","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3888027569,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAwi8tc7nvpex","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/Next%20Action:%20Reviewers","name":"Next

This caused a failure if the runner doesn't fuse with the downstream extract output stage.\r\n  * In particular, we now check if the data bundle exists when we have 0 elements, and if so, re-encode using the existing bundle.\r\n* Move to the generic Register package instead of the legacy code generator variant.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27550 and https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/24789.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

two changes to Python worker start-up logging to reduce the verbosity of INFO logs: \r\n1. Log imports for beam-plugins and modules for beam-plugins at DEBUG instead of INFO (~20 lines per worker)\r\n2. Has pip invocations at worker start-up run at quiet level 1, suppressing INFO logs (>50 lines per worker)\r\n\r\nThis reduces the noisy boilerplate logging that happens during these steps but still surfaces errors that occur. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to prism.\r\n\r\n* Fixes the coder side inputs use WRT reading to match what was written to the runner. They wouldn't match if the coder needed to be replaced, so a synthetic PCollection is added with the new coder for the SDK to lookup and be able to correctly decode the elements sent over the SDK.\r\n* Fixes a halting problem when a ProcessBundle request fails. SDK Errors on progress reporting, and Splits now abort future progress reports and splits for that bundle. This was making some tests run to timeout.\r\n* Remove extra logging of bundle failures. A sibling change makes failures report properly to the SDK via the JobManangment API where they can be properly logged as well.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27550 and https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/24789.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the universal runner in two key ways to unblock prism adoption.\r\n\r\n* For loopback mode execution, avoid unecessary compile and upload costs when the binary isn't overridded. Uses an empty temporary file. Filed #27569 to have a better canon location for this.\r\n* Cache the most recent error log from the message stream and report that as the cause of job failure, vs the previous error reporting which was merely \"job failed\". For runners that actually report job failure messages, this can reduce time for debugging and iteration.\r\n\r\nPrism will make use of these, but any portable runner or loopback runner can make use of them. In particular, the message holding replicates what the direct runner can do with failues during its single threaded execution. There are unit tests in the SDK that rely on this behaviour, but it is extremely useful too.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/27550 and https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/24789.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR to make prism the default runner. Will be sending out smaller slices of this separately for review.\r\n\r\nThis fixes up several paper cuts WRT the prism runner vs the direct runner in Go SDK code. As well as fixing up a few issues WRT built-ins running on portable runners.\r\n\r\nCritically, it avoids discrepancies between the direct runner implementation and the expectations of other (portable) runners. While this does make things slightly harder to get started, it homogenizes the experience when moving to production beam runners from testing, which will make documenting correct procedures consistent, and provide consistent test implementations.\r\n\r\n* Sets prism to be the default runner for the Go SDK.\r\n  * Replace direct uses of `direct` package with prism.\r\n  * Mark the direct runner package as Deprecated.\r\n  * TODO: Provide clear instructions for what to do/use instead.\r\n  * TODO: Run all the examples with prism.\r\n* Update the SDK to require Go 1.20\r\n  * Due to prism's exp/slog dependency, which will be migrated to the standard library version with go 1.21.\r\n  * Going to need to make some additional repo changes to ensure this submits.\r\n* Adds a prism stanza for the integration tests\r\n  * TODO: Add jenkin's target and run as a precommit (like the Python Portable runs)\r\n* Ensure all unit tested DoFns are registered. Update some things to use the generic registration package. Outstanding work to do a full conversion to the register package.\r\n* Add calls to ptest.Main in TestMains for package unit tests that use ptest.\r\n* The datastore and fhirio packages stay on the \"direct\" runner because they don't have portable testing implementations. Those issues have been filed seperately. datastore (#27549) and fhirio (#27547), This only pertains to their ability to test, not executed.\r\n* Fixed top.accum to handle when it's not in a fused stage.\r\n* Update the debug string for ParDo execution nodes to list side inputs. \r\n* Update the debug string side inputs to list coder.\r\n* Clarify harness ProcessBundle handling as the error source when the failure from materializing ProcessBundleDescriptors to exec.Plans.\r\n* Ensure data handling errors that end up at harness are actually reported as errors that fail a bundle.\r\n* Update the universal runner to track the last error message over the stream, and return that as the pipeline failure message. Alternatively, wait until the stream terminates or an error message is received after the JobState is Failed. This allows prism (and other portable runners) to produce the failure cause cleanly to the launching task (if it's still up).\r\n* Have the universal runner wrapper avoid the Go binary compile step when the execution is set to Loopback mode. Generates a temporary empty file and sets that as the \"worker_binary\". This avoids waiting on compiles between each test, when the binary would not even be used anyway.\r\n  * Adds \"Loopback\" as a field option to the runnerlib package.\r\n* Quieted down some info logs.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Prism Fixes\r\n  * Ensuring coders for SideInputs are properly set if their PCollection coder is replaced. Otherwise this would lead to problems on decoding.\r\n  * Moves test DoFns into a internal_test package. Otherwise there's a circular dependency with importing prism into ptest for executing pipelines with prism as default.\r\n  * Track the \"pipeline terminating failure\" and ensure that is logged as an Error class message over the message stream.\r\n  * Have SDK errors on Progress or Split abort the progress loop. Doesn't abort bundle processing, but prevents receiving tentative results. Prevents non-termination of prism jobs on failures, when stuck in the loop.\r\n  * Since SDK errors are now relayed back to the launching process as log messages, no longer log them at the prism end. Removes verbose duplicate messages.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional TODOs\r\n* Handle CoGBKs in prism (in particular, Expand Nodes, likely through fusion)\r\n* Handle Reshuffles (likely as a no-op), since the Windowing Strategy/Triggers it use aren't implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee #24789\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

conversion of rows to the external object is rather inefficient. The code to convert Row fields to the external field types required for the constructor / setters in `FromRowUsingCreator` is branch heavy and rather hard to optimize for Java's JIT compiler.\r\n\r\n### Functional observations:\r\n\r\nMaps and Collections / Lists are currently handled inconsistently:\r\n- Maps are eagerly rewritten / copied, making their usage rather expensive. The user object will contain fully operable maps.\r\n- Collections / Lists are converted using Guava views (e.g. `Lists.transform`). The user object will contain collections that can mostly just be read from, THOUGH it's possible to remove items from the underlying collection potentially causing issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n###  Changes in this PR:\r\n- On first usage, generate a converter function for every field based on schema & type information. No more branching required when applying the function. This way the code is also better JIT optimizable.\r\n- [TBD] Depending on types a conversion might not be required at all, in this case the conversion is skipped using an identity converter, e.g. this is the case for a map of primitive types. Though, passing references of maps / collections could potentially cause issues in certain situations (but this is already a given, see above).\r\n\r\n### Benchmark results\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-07-17 at 17 27 53](https://github.com/apache/beam/assets/1401430/4d7abf25-c32c-436c-b3e5-c9f1fffa14bf)\r\n\r\nHistoric benchmarks for `GetterBasedSchemaProvider` are available here (master branch only): https://s.apache.org/beam-community-metrics/d/kllfR2vVk/java-jmh-benchmarks?orgId=1\r\n\r\nCloses #27533\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/CHANGES.rst\">cython's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>3.0.0 unified release notes</h1>\n<p>Cython 3.0.0 has been a very large effort that cleaned up many old warts,\nintroduced many new features, and introduces a couple of intentional\nbehaviour changes, even though the goal remained to stay compatible as\nmuch as possible with Cython 0.29.x. For details, see the <code>migration guide</code>_.</p>\n<p>.. _<code>migration guide</code>: <a href=\"https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/migrating_to_cy30.html\">https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/migrating_to_cy30.html</a></p>\n<p>As the development was spread out over several years, a lot of things have\nhappened in the meantime. Many crucial bugfixes and some features were\nbackported to 0.29.x and are not strictly speaking &quot;new&quot; in Cython 3.0.0.</p>\n<h1>Major themes in 3.0.0</h1>\n<h2>Compatibility with Python</h2>\n<p>Since Cython 3.0.0 started development, CPython 3.8-3.11 were released.\nAll these are supported in Cython, including experimental support for the\nin-development CPython 3.12. On the other end of the spectrum, support for\nPython 2.6 was dropped.</p>\n<p>Cython interacts very closely with the C-API of Python, which is where most\nof the adaptation work happens. Independently, Cython strives to be able to\nparse newer Python constructs for use with its <code>pure python</code>_ mode, which\nhas been a focus. In short, this allows to compile a wider range of Python\ncode into optimized C code.</p>\n<p>.. _<code>pure python</code>: <a href=\"https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html\">https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html</a></p>\n<p>Implemented PEPs\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>PEP-3131</code>_: Supporting Non-ASCII Identifiers (Github issue :issue:<code>2601</code>)</li>\n<li><code>PEP-479</code>_: <code>generator_stop</code> (enabled by default for <code>language_level=3</code>) (Github issue :issue:<code>2580</code>)</li>\n<li><code>PEP-487</code>_: Simpler customisation of class creation (Github issue :issue:<code>2781</code>)</li>\n<li><code>PEP-563</code>_: Postponed Evaluation of Annotations (Github issue :issue:<code>3285</code>)</li>\n<li><code>PEP-570</code>_: Positional-Only Parameters (Github issue :issue:<code>2915</code>)</li>\n<li><code>PEP-572</code>_: Assignment Expressions (a.k.a. the walrus operator <code>:=</code>) (Github issue :issue:<code>2636</code>)</li>\n<li><code>PEP-590</code>_: Vectorcall protocol (Github issue :issue:<code>2263</code>)</li>\n<li><code>PEP-614</code>_: Relaxing Grammar Restrictions On Decorators (Github issue :issue:<code>4570</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typing support in the sense of <code>PEP-484</code>_ (Github issues :issue:<code>3949</code>, :issue:<code>4243</code>)\nand <code>PEP-560</code>_ (Github issues :issue:<code>2753</code>, :issue:<code>3537</code>, :issue:<code>3764</code>) was also improved.</p>\n<p>.. _<code>PEP-3131</code>: <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131\">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131</a>\n.. _<code>PEP-479</code>: <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479\">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479</a></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
