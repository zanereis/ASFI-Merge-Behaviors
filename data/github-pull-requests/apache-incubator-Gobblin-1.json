Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-14T14:05:07Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T06:01:17Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a19f32b36250d716708795f94ab56ec5e4dff6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4092/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4092/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4092/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4c7b019d72bab5c6a8f6c6296b80e150fac50fa6","head":{"label":"Blazer-007:virai_add_yarn_container_replacement","ref":"virai_add_yarn_container_replacement","sha":"4c7b019d72bab5c6a8f6c6296b80e150fac50fa6","user":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808042965,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCnB1Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"Blazer-007/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2188\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nStateful writer/converter `Initializer`s, such as `JdbcWriterInitializer`, work fine with Gobblin-on-MR, but get disrupted by GoT. While GoMR does also launch an MR application, the remainder of the `MRJobLauncher` execution is within the same process.  An `Initializer` must execute at the end of WorkDiscovery, before `WorkUnit` processing may begin, but is `.close()`d only after Job Commit completes.  Crucially, with GoMR, the same `Initializer` instance remains in memory all throughout.  With GoT, in contrast, Work Discovery and Commit execute completely independently - creating new objects/instances, perhaps even on a new host/container.\r\n\r\nSome `Initializer`s, such as the `JdbcWriter`'s `JdbcWriterInitializer` are stateful.  (In its case, to maintain the temp/staging table's name, so that may be dropped upon successful Commit.)  Specific state originates during Work Discovery (the `GenerateWorkUnitsImpl` activity in GoT) yet must be available during Commit (the `CommitActivityImpl` in GoT).\r\n\r\nAccordingly we define the `Initializer.AfterInitializeMemento` interface so any concrete `Initializer` impl has the opportunity to optionally define an opaque snapshot of its internal state that may be (de)serialized and \"revived\" as a new `Initializer` instance of the same concrete type, and holding equivalent internal state.\r\n\r\nThe evolved `Initializer` interface/API provides `default` impls for the new methods `commemorate` and `recall`, making it source-compatible with existing implementations.  Any existing `Initializer` that does NOT maintain internal state for its `close()` to use may be recompiled unchanged, and succeed with GoT.\r\n\r\nThis GoT enhancement leverages `JobState` to tunnel `AfterInitializeMemento`s, since it is serialized at the end of Work Discovery (in `GenerateWorkUnitsImpl`), and is later loaded when the Commit activity begins (in `CommitStepActivityImpl`).\r\n\r\n**Review Tip:** start first with how `Initializer.AfterInitializeMemento`s are created in `GenerateWorkUnitsImpl` and used by `CommitStepActivityImpl` before diving into their impl (with test).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nincludes new `MultiInitializerTest`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-06T13:17:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T20:08:16Z","closed_at":"2025-01-07T10:46:55Z","merged_at":"2025-01-07T10:46:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"a0cef2822d9558c7817bc9ff78f786b8bd58a8db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4091/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4091/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4091/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/746e378dd74a64da1de2891ebc74496877f35448","head":{"label":"phet:initializer-mementos-for-got","ref":"initializer-mementos-for-got","sha":"746e378dd74a64da1de2891ebc74496877f35448","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2187\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nwhen `workunit` is empty then while serializing wusizesummary GSON throws below exception `NaN is not a valid double value as per JSON specification. To override this behavior, use GsonBuilder.serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues() method`\r\n this is coming due to not handling when values are zeros which generates NaN while generating wusizesummary\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded `testDigestWorkUnitsSizeWithEmptyWorkUnits`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-06T09:33:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T14:33:58Z","closed_at":"2025-01-06T13:38:05Z","merged_at":"2025-01-06T13:38:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"87c8ab4a4297c213058fabfb1752f33a2aa47c39","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4090/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4090/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4090/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/48f27aef7e329ec48f0375f7a1b2736aa693d0ee","head":{"label":"Blazer-007:virai_nan_fix","ref":"virai_nan_fix","sha":"48f27aef7e329ec48f0375f7a1b2736aa693d0ee","user":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808042965,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCnB1Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"Blazer-007/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2186\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n`GaaSJobObservabilityEvent`s for Gobblin-on-Temporal jobs presently have no values set for the fields `jobPlanningStartTimestamp` and `jobPlanningEndTimestamp`.  This is because, in contrast with Gobblin-on-MR, `GenerateWorkUnitsImpl` emits no `TimingEvent.LauncherTimings.WORK_UNITS_CREATION` GTE to record such values.\r\n\r\nThe historical impediment was that Temporal does not permit Activities to launch other Activities (only Workflows may do that).  `TemporalEventTimer`, however, emitted its GTE on a separate Activity for reliability.  This change reworks `TemporalEventTimer.Factory` to be useable within an `Activity`, by refactoring into complementary concrete realizations - `TemporalEventTimer.WithinWorkflowFactory` and `TemporalEventTimer.WithinActivityFactory`.  The latter sets up direct GTE emission within the same (current) `Activity`.\r\n\r\nThe alternative of reworking `GenerateWorkUnitsImpl` from an `Activity` into a `Workflow` would be challenging to accomplish, because \"Work Discovery\" may be quite long running \\- 15-30 mins is not uncommon for large full-initial-copy Iceberg-Distcp jobs \\- yet Temporal [allows a workflow-task to run for a maximum of 2 minutes](https://docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout).  (Since we wish to emit this timing GTE *in the midst of* Work Discovery, it would not be easy to have one sub-activity first performing all of Work Discovery and another subsequently doing GTE emission once the first concludes.)\r\n\r\nIn addition, now that this refactoring happily unblocks GTE-emission from `GenerateWorkUnitsImpl` we were primed to emit new metadata (on another GTE), which is actually even more critical to emit *in the midst of* Work Discovery: one to record the volume of `WorkUnit`s discovered.   To be useful, this must be done prior to WU serialization, which is memory-intensive and may OOM.  If that should happen this GTE's durable measurement would inform re-configuration for any subsequent re-attempt.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we preserve total size and counts, means, and medians of both original and bin packed WUs.  This was inspired by a pair of log messages produced within `CopySource::getWorkUnits`:\r\n```\r\nStatistics for ConcurrentBoundedPriorityIterable: {ResourcePool: {softBound: [ ... ], hardBound: [ ...]},totalResourcesUsed: [ ... ], maxRequirementPerDimension: [entities: 231943.0, bytesCopied: 1.22419622769628E14], ... }\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\norg.apache.gobblin.data.management.copy.CopySource - Bin packed work units. Initial work units: 27252, packed work units: 13175, max weight per bin: 500000000, max work units per bin: 100.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe often seek out these messages to diagnose and resolve failures during `WorkUnit` Discovery, but rather than merely logging, this durable emission sets up fully-automatic (machine-to-machine) right-sizing to orchestrate a potential re-attempt (in case of WU serialization OOM error).\r\n\r\n(Actual handling of this new GTE `TimingEvent#WORKUNITS_GENERATED_SUMMARY` metadata by GaaS will require a separate change, e.g. [to `KafkaAvroJobStatusMonitor#parseJobStatus`](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/blob/7dbeebf7fecc748ea3ef90cc318214cf26ba5afa/gobblin-service/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/service/monitoring/KafkaAvroJobStatusMonitor.java#L120).)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nmanual execution\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-01T16:19:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T05:39:23Z","closed_at":"2025-01-02T05:39:23Z","merged_at":"2025-01-02T05:39:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"3269764a1141acbeeb9f5f8f867ccfeb803b22d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4089/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4089/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4089/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8ce206d078e186360697b88bf7165dca26165d15","head":{"label":"phet:got-gen-wu-prep-events","ref":"got-gen-wu-prep-events","sha":"8ce206d078e186360697b88bf7165dca26165d15","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2185\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nTaking a configured (constant) Data Transfer Rate (in bytes per minute) and a configured time budget (to bound job runtime), presume a linear relationship holds between \"Work\" (i.e. `WorkUnit`) throughput and scaling the number of worker-containers.  `RecommendScalingForWorkUnitsLinearHeuristicImpl` gives a heuristic-based recommendation in the form of a `ScalingDirective` (https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/4068) for how many worker-containers to allocate in order to complete processing of a job within that `TimeBudget`.  The job's volume of Work is conveyed via `WorkUnitsSizeSummary` (https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/4082)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nincluded\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-13T04:42:55Z","updated_at":"2024-12-24T07:14:23Z","closed_at":"2024-12-24T07:14:22Z","merged_at":"2024-12-24T07:14:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"7dbeebf7fecc748ea3ef90cc318214cf26ba5afa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4087/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4087/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4087/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8abfb4f7b3369e6c95e816d783b211670f61fbc6","head":{"label":"phet:got-auto-scaling-poc","ref":"got-auto-scaling-poc","sha":"8abfb4f7b3369e6c95e816d783b211670f61fbc6","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2179\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nEnhance GoT observability with `WorkUnitsSizeSummary` and `WorkUnitSizeInfo`:\r\n\r\na. `GenerateWorkUnits`' result type, `GenerateWorkUnitsResult`, now contains `WorkUnitsSizeSummary`, capturing the total number of `MultiWorkUnit`s and constituent sub-`WorkUnit`s, the total size in bytes, as well as the size distribution across all WUs.\r\n\r\nb. `WorkUnitClaimCheck`, which is the argument to `ProcessWorkUnit` now contains `WorkUnitSizeInfo`, capturing the total size of the possibly `MultiWorkUnit` as well as an abbreviated characterization of the size of any constituent `WorkUnit`s.\r\n\r\nTogether these now provide observable info to feed the analysis for our forthcoming Gobblin-on-Temporal (GoT) auto-scaling and right-sizing, based on Dynamic Scaling (https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/4068).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nadded them\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-10T09:54:59Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T05:16:22Z","closed_at":"2024-12-11T05:16:22Z","merged_at":"2024-12-11T05:16:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"003590e7d58691505d8fb73988db35ae636873f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4082/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4082/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4082/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/37c5468e72c4257a8541a08cdd52c2d42da0f4e4","head":{"label":"phet:got-wu-observability","ref":"got-wu-observability","sha":"37c5468e72c4257a8541a08cdd52c2d42da0f4e4","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2178\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe avro file `GaaSObservabilityEventExperimental` has been split into `GaaSFlowObservabilityEvent` and `GaaSJobObservabilityEvent` and since been deprecated. \r\n\r\nAny future changes to the structure found in the deprecated file (like `jobStatus` ; containing only the failure states as of now) will require unnecessary changes to the deprecated version as well.\r\n\r\nRemoving the deprecated file simplifies such changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe deprecated file isn't used anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-09T08:04:44Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T07:52:20Z","closed_at":"2024-12-11T07:52:20Z","merged_at":"2024-12-11T07:52:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4728fb9f5708aada9e4face689b1b22db40dc77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/72bd180597e60b8123a95a0789e0ad99b81386a5","head":{"label":"iPalash:remove_deprecated_unused_avro_file","ref":"remove_deprecated_unused_avro_file","sha":"72bd180597e60b8123a95a0789e0ad99b81386a5","user":{"login":"iPalash","id":3626711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash","html_url":"https://github.com/iPalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":877303636,"node_id":"R_kgDONEqXVA","name":"gobblin","full_name":"iPalash/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iPalash","id":3626711,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626711?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash","html_url":"https://github.com/iPalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iPalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iPalash/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2177) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-2177] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2177\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFor `enable.auto.commit` as `true`:\r\n\r\nThe `QueueProcessor` has an infinite while loop which gets stopped upon encountering any Exception. This effectively drops the messages being consumed post such Exception.\r\nThe implemented fix ensures that for any non-Interrupted Exception, we log the occurrence and keep trying to process further messages.\r\nFor InterruptedException, we interrupt the current thread and stop the queue processor.\r\nThe infinite while loop is also updated to stop based on shutdown flag.\r\n\r\nFor `enable.auto.commit` as `false`:\r\nMessages are not committed if an exception occurs. In this case we will stop queue processing to maintain the order of message commit. (If we avoid stopping here, messages may be committed out of order)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded a unit test to verify all messages are processed, even on encountering any Exception.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-02T12:22:42Z","updated_at":"2024-12-13T08:00:17Z","closed_at":"2024-12-13T08:00:17Z","merged_at":"2024-12-13T08:00:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"2595f6c328df95599634e0f95d9bf6ddf8150fb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/070c7d342f06791ef76f84c21ef1677cedf62527","head":{"label":"abhishekmjain:fix-continue-queue-processor-on-exception","ref":"fix-continue-queue-processor-on-exception","sha":"070c7d342f06791ef76f84c21ef1677cedf62527","user":{"login":"abhishekmjain","id":16535454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16535454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810140032,"node_id":"R_kgDOMEnBgA","name":"gobblin","full_name":"abhishekmjain/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abhishekmjain","id":16535454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16535454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain/gobblin","description":"A

This failure propagates upwards, resulting in a ChildWorkflowExecutionFailed for the next enclosing parent, ProcessWorkUnitsImpl. Consequently, the CommitStepWorkflow, which is crucial for file-level commit, does not execute. The file rename into the final destination occurs during the commit step, not within the task itself. This issue disrupts the workflow, as the commit step is essential for completing the file-level commit process.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we modify ProcessWorkUnitsImpl to catch the child workflow failure and still perform the CommitStepWorkflow before exiting.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2173) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2173\r\n\r\nBefore launching the flows we store adhoc flows temporarily in our flowspec DB. In case of concurrent execution of the flows within the epsilon time defined the first execution is launched successfully, but for the second execution flow spec entry is created but launching is not successful since lease cannot be acquired, for this scenario we should prevent creation of flowspec entry in the spec store, this PR contains code change to address this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tests added to ensure onAddSpec in Orchestrator is successful only if lease can be acquired on entity(call to function leasableEntryExists), if it does not then throw LeaseNotAvailable Exception\r\n- [ ] Tests in MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter to ensure existsLeasableEntry returns false, if tried to call this function within epsilon time of acquiring the lease else return true.\r\n- [ ] existing tests pass\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-14T17:37:49Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T19:57:07Z","closed_at":"2024-11-19T19:57:07Z","merged_at":"2024-11-19T19:57:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"e5d897edaee391d05a55e6ac8a420e3416fef6d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b59694803569520030be7ace6b58bac7bdd27c72","head":{"label":"vsinghal85:adhoc-flow-deletion-bug","ref":"adhoc-flow-deletion-bug","sha":"b59694803569520030be7ace6b58bac7bdd27c72","user":{"login":"vsinghal85","id":13609182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA5MTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13609182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85","html_url":"https://github.com/vsinghal85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":874672577,"node_id":"R_kgDONCJxwQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"vsinghal85/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vsinghal85","id":13609182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjA5MTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13609182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85","html_url":"https://github.com/vsinghal85","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsinghal85/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vsinghal85/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2171\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nSome logs from GaaS flow/DAG processing, e.g. by the `MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter`, the `FlowLaunchHandler`, the `DagProcessingEngine`, etc., are challenging to skim, especially when only the first characters on the line are shown (as the remaining content of long lines flows beyond view).\r\n\r\nImprove consistency, brevity, and the placement of the most-vital info.  Also contextualize when it's not otherwise clear where in the processing a message originates (e.g. which `MultiActiveLeaseArbiter` instance).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nexisting tests still pass\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-09T01:36:14Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T17:05:48Z","closed_at":"2024-11-13T17:05:48Z","merged_at":"2024-11-13T17:05:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"13a6926d955ae8381cc1e2963b6585f49d873350","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4074/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4074/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4074/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/6233476561e1dbce6733e045251890afa60c8f88","head":{"label":"phet:gaas-multi-leader-logging","ref":"gaas-multi-leader-logging","sha":"6233476561e1dbce6733e045251890afa60c8f88","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2167\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nHive tables can be located in different folders in HDFS even if they belong to the same database.\r\nThis becomes tricky to manage within a single Gobblin job especially when there are different permissions and handling based on underlying files for viewFS.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a configuration to have a regex to filter tables based on their table location:\r\n```\r\nhive.dataset.tableFolderAllowlistFilter=<regex>\r\n```\r\nwhere tables with paths matching this filter will be selected, otherwise ignore\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-19T03:39:04Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T03:22:35Z","closed_at":"2024-10-22T03:22:34Z","merged_at":"2024-10-22T03:22:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"916d570a7eb3db291a5f7af5dea3a1b75d8fff9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/19062867ffc93aeb0e0e7729a8858f8a517f2fae","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:add-underlying-fs-allowlist-hive-dataset-finder","ref":"add-underlying-fs-allowlist-hive-dataset-finder","sha":"19062867ffc93aeb0e0e7729a8858f8a517f2fae","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2170\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nEnable Gobblin-on-Temporal to dynamically scale up/down the number of workers and also to reconfigure worker containers (including resource resizing).  Support a heterogeneous workforce of multiple simultaneous worker container configurations.\r\n\r\nThe `ScalingDirective`, `WorkforcePlan`, and `WorkforceStaffing` abstractions will allow implementing with the current GoT-atop-YARN deployment, while also being general enough for containerization beyond YARN, such as with k8s.\r\n\r\nThe `ScalingDirectiveParser` supports a simple and compact human-readable syntax for Dynamic Scaling Directives that is \"FS-safe\", so each DSD may appear as a filename w/o excessive encoding.  This enables the `FsScalingDirectiveSource` to function as a source of Dynamic Scaling Directives by reading entries from a HDFS directory ordered by file modtime.\r\n\r\n#### Suggested review sequence:\r\n* `ScalingDirective` => `WorkforceStaffing` => `WorkforcePlan` (with `WorkforceStaffingTest` and `WorkforcePlanTest` along the way)\r\n* `ScalingDirectiveParser` (with `ScalingDirectiveParserTest`)\r\n* `FsScalingDirectiveSource` (with `FsScalingDirectiveSourceTest`)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nunit tests included\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-18T11:53:08Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T15:49:52Z","closed_at":"2024-11-19T15:49:52Z","merged_at":"2024-11-19T15:49:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"4e38b2fd25eb4ca84227f654a0f949c8f598f75e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4068/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4068/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4068/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/6997cae9d0fa21c3bf15a73db813ac5aacb8d5af","head":{"label":"phet:temporal-dynamic-scaling","ref":"temporal-dynamic-scaling","sha":"6997cae9d0fa21c3bf15a73db813ac5aacb8d5af","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2166) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-2166] GoT must fill in info required for RMAppSummaryEvent fields\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2166\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGoT doesn't send applicationTags while submitting yarn app from the launcher GobblinYarnAppLauncher. This PR adds the applicationTags to appSubmissionContext during yarn app submission.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested the change in a local azkaban project\r\n\r\nThe below query shows azkaban properties populated in RMAppSummaryEvent\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect * from service.rmappsummaryevent\r\n  where appid in ('application_1729067421867_143934')\r\n    and datepartition between '2024-10-15' and '2024-10-18'\r\n  limit 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-17T04:58:41Z","updated_at":"2024-10-21T16:41:52Z","closed_at":"2024-10-21T16:41:51Z","merged_at":"2024-10-21T16:41:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3baf914ba1a0b7780cb9d8335f600acce1f7dc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/86b707610a1665b74abee444f3ad53d9df6b5d45","head":{"label":"abhishekmjain:got-rmappsummaryevent-fix","ref":"got-rmappsummaryevent-fix","sha":"86b707610a1665b74abee444f3ad53d9df6b5d45","user":{"login":"abhishekmjain","id":16535454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16535454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810140032,"node_id":"R_kgDOMEnBgA","name":"gobblin","full_name":"abhishekmjain/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abhishekmjain","id":16535454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16535454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2165\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen Gobblin is using partial commit semantics, it is possible for files to be missing on the destination after the job is completed (in line with the semantic where any number of files may be missing, as long as one file is successfully published it can still be considered successful).\r\n\r\nCurrently, Gobblin will raise a FileNotFoundException when this file is being published if its performs a metadata sync, which prevents the job from running through its postpublish steps. We still want the postpublish steps to go through as they may contain important steps for the job to be considered at least partially successful (permission sync, table registration).\r\n\r\nThis PR allows one to add the configurations\r\n```\r\njob.commit.policy: successful // or job.commit.policy=partial\r\njob.commit.partial.fail.task.fails.job.commit=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd have a job publish all of its successful files but still mark the job as failed.\r\nIt is important that certain table copies (e.g. iceberg distcp) should not be supporting partial copy semantics in the same way as it would break the table manifest. Also care should be taken with hive copies so that subsequent copies will still copy the missing files (turn off fast partition skip predicate).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-07T19:55:40Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T01:22:16Z","closed_at":"2024-10-08T01:22:15Z","merged_at":"2024-10-08T01:22:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"2afab699def9e02f99278ca748223c1bfd8901fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4066/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4066/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4066/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/433b42f170b6bcd75acffb1e75ccb7dd5781114c","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:support-partial-semantics-distcp-publish","ref":"support-partial-semantics-distcp-publish","sha":"433b42f170b6bcd75acffb1e75ccb7dd5781114c","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2164\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    - As per the Metric Data Model (MDM) documentation, it is essential to define pre-aggregation rules for metrics to allow for effective slicing and dicing based on dimensions. When emitting metrics, if any dimension within a pre-aggregation does not have a value (i.e., it is an empty string \"\"), the metric will be dropped as it is treated as having no value, which prevents accurate metric reporting and analysis. \r\n    - Added default value to ensure that all dimensions for pre-aggregated metrics are populated with either their actual values or a default placeholder value `-` if they are empty.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"","created_at":"2024-10-07T17:54:19Z","updated_at":"2024-10-07T19:27:47Z","closed_at":"2024-10-07T19:27:46Z","merged_at":"2024-10-07T19:27:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4c9c3513521e9f0049bee489215738ccb37f09a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4065/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4065/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4065/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/199e88ed439fd2efbfdca49ed6057ae4c6174954","head":{"label":"khandelwal-prateek:ot-default-val","ref":"ot-default-val","sha":"199e88ed439fd2efbfdca49ed6057ae4c6174954","user":{"login":"khandelwal-prateek","id":60776475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzc2NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60776475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek","html_url":"https://github.com/khandelwal-prateek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":855530185,"node_id":"R_kgDOMv5ayQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"khandelwal-prateek/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khandelwal-prateek","id":60776475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzc2NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60776475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek","html_url":"https://github.com/khandelwal-prateek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khandelwal-prateek/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [✔️] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2163\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [✔️] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n   - Added a class which will validate whether schema and partition spec between two tables metadata are similar or not and will throw IllegalArgumentException if there is any mismatch \r\n   - This class will be used in IcebergPartitionDatasetFinder to validate whether we want to proceed with copying of partition data files between source and destination iceberg tables or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [✔️] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   -  IcebergTableMetadataValidatorTest\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [✔️] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2161\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    - This is a follow-up change from https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/4061, the change missed reading logExporter classname from the config property `metrics.reporting.opentelemetry.logexporter.className`'s value and was instead reading from config property's key. Fixed it to initialize LogExporter classname from the value in the config.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-03T02:54:50Z","updated_at":"2024-10-03T05:46:10Z","closed_at":"2024-10-03T05:46:10Z","merged_at":"2024-10-03T05:46:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"4776135a83295af69a467cdf547679775ab6e44b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4063/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4063/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4063/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1f45fa7c6ef31cf9d23974f5bc9d7cc1a8d1d2bf","head":{"label":"khandelwal-prateek:ot-logexporter","ref":"ot-logexporter","sha":"1f45fa7c6ef31cf9d23974f5bc9d7cc1a8d1d2bf","user":{"login":"khandelwal-prateek","id":60776475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzc2NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60776475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek","html_url":"https://github.com/khandelwal-prateek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":855530185,"node_id":"R_kgDOMv5ayQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"khandelwal-prateek/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khandelwal-prateek","id":60776475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzc2NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60776475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek","html_url":"https://github.com/khandelwal-prateek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khandelwal-prateek/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2162\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhen Gobblin launches a YARN app, if the cache is enabled it will load all the jars stored in the cache into the classpath.\r\n\r\nThis can be problematic as jars that persisted from older versions of jars or other executions may clobber the classpath, adding jars that are not needed or jars that interfere with the current jars.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that only the jars that were intended to be uploaded by the GobblinYarnAppLauncher are the only jars that are loaded into the classpath from the shared cache.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-02T23:59:47Z","updated_at":"2024-10-21T15:17:01Z","closed_at":"2024-10-21T15:16:59Z","merged_at":"2024-10-21T15:16:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f604235b037eeb801b78950c897adeef2449d67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9c8c1e5b2626c31d42ae685fbe21bdab876829f8","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:ensure-yarn-cache-only-loads-uploaded-jars","ref":"ensure-yarn-cache-only-loads-uploaded-jars","sha":"9c8c1e5b2626c31d42ae685fbe21bdab876829f8","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2161\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    - Added support for configuring openTelemetry metric exporter as logExporter, which would be useful to log metric data for debugging. The logging metricExporter is configured using a flag which is set to `false` by default and `OtlpHttpMetricExporter` would be the default metricExporter class.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-26T18:06:42Z","updated_at":"2024-09-30T16:52:10Z","closed_at":"2024-09-30T16:52:10Z","merged_at":"2024-09-30T16:52:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"2bc563854e8bcb6dd086aac26fb36fbd37a11f2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4061/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4061/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4061/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ca373eaec20c3ed37fc40d24b04adfbed01ae719","head":{"label":"khandelwal-prateek:open-telemetry-logexporter","ref":"open-telemetry-logexporter","sha":"ca373eaec20c3ed37fc40d24b04adfbed01ae719","user":{"login":"khandelwal-prateek","id":60776475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzc2NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60776475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek","html_url":"https://github.com/khandelwal-prateek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":855530185,"node_id":"R_kgDOMv5ayQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"khandelwal-prateek/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khandelwal-prateek","id":60776475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzc2NDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60776475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek","html_url":"https://github.com/khandelwal-prateek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khandelwal-prateek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khandelwal-prateek/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [✅] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2159\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [✅] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    - Currently, in Iceberg Distcp it is not possible to specify which partitions to copy. This PR aims to do that by adding support for partition level copy in Iceberg distcp.\r\n    - It supports partition copy between two different iceberg tables meaning with different UUIDs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [✅] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n     - IcebergPartitionDatasetTest\r\n     - IcebergOverwritePartitionsStepTest\r\n     - IcebergTableTest [ Updated ]\r\n                - testGetPartitionSpecificDataFiles()\r\n                - testReplacePartitions()\r\n     - IcebergMatchesAnyPropNamePartitionFilterPredicateTest\r\n     - IcebergPartitionFilterPredicateUtilTest\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [✅] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-22T16:20:51Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T19:37:53Z","closed_at":"2024-10-23T18:47:01Z","merged_at":"2024-10-23T18:47:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b639f6b75ff716f8f2903678c6bf89e0b7a1690","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4058/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4058/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4058/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/675e8bb012c08e68ef4eaf0eda099d4d52d54238","head":{"label":"Blazer-007:iceberg_distcp_partition_copy_0","ref":"iceberg_distcp_partition_copy_0","sha":"675e8bb012c08e68ef4eaf0eda099d4d52d54238","user":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808042965,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCnB1Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"Blazer-007/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2157\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe existing iceberg registration step has the following snippet:\r\n```\r\n    if (dstMetadata != null) {\r\n      // use current destination metadata as 'base metadata' and source as 'updated metadata' while committing\r\n      this.tableOps.commit(dstMetadata, srcMetadata.replaceProperties(dstMetadata.properties())); <<<<<------- BUG\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nSince Iceberg's `replaceProperties` https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/e449d3405cfdb304c94835845bd8f34a73b4a517/core/src/main/java/org/apache/iceberg/TableMetadata.java#L583 just replaces the full set of properties, not just any existing properties, the result is that all of the properties are equivalent to the destination table metadata properties. Which effectively copies no properties.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies this behavior so that the destination table properties can be overwritten by the source table properties if the source table updates existing properties, as well as maintaining any existing properties in the destination that is not defined on the source.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-13T23:18:52Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T21:34:36Z","closed_at":"2024-09-19T21:34:32Z","merged_at":"2024-09-19T21:34:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fa6c51094ea2b70ee8175d7cb00e076bbef3d0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4056/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4056/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4056/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e4331fe8e40fa2ea591a4d0cd1d5d78625b619ad","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:copy-table-properties-iceberg-distcp","ref":"copy-table-properties-iceberg-distcp","sha":"e4331fe8e40fa2ea591a4d0cd1d5d78625b619ad","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2155\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently there is a bug in Temporal when there are no work directories to delete, e.g. non hdfs sink jobs.\r\n```\r\nCaused by: io.temporal.common.converter.DataConverterException: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: successesByDirPath is marked non-null but is null\r\n at [Source: (byte[])\"{\"successesByDirPath\":null}\"; line: 1, column: 23] (through reference chain: org.apache.gobblin.temporal.ddm.work.DirDeletionResult[\"successesByDirPath\"])\r\n\tat io.temporal.common.converter.JacksonJsonPayloadConverter.fromData(JacksonJsonPayloadConverter.java:101)\r\n\tat io.temporal.common.converter.DefaultDataConverter.fromPayload(DefaultDataConverter.java:145) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR defines a createEmpty() function in DeleteWorkDirs Activity so that it defines a new activity with the empty hashmap instead of null\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-13T18:19:00Z","updated_at":"2024-09-13T18:55:08Z","closed_at":"2024-09-13T18:55:07Z","merged_at":"2024-09-13T18:55:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"c3d16b216417178b944551a9d9689542f06aee31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4054/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4054/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4054/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/87fa838064e9d26e069d5e857eae929a41bf2bcd","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-empty-delete-workdirs-activity-result","ref":"fix-empty-delete-workdirs-activity-result","sha":"87fa838064e9d26e069d5e857eae929a41bf2bcd","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2154\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/gobblin/commit/45ad13e07ebe212002b279132e1fa4d121a9294f while moving DagId from DagManager to Dag class, we changed toString method to lombok's generated method. This has in impact, and in DMSS, where it stores this id, it cannot find the old entries.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nverified the change through existing test cases\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-12T17:11:42Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T17:35:48Z","closed_at":"2024-09-12T17:35:48Z","merged_at":"2024-09-12T17:35:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"35a4d8e7a1031691c03bba401078d34b3850eb2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4053/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4053/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4053/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4af4f63172927bce0ef704570eae2e56d6837035","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:dagIdToString","ref":"dagIdToString","sha":"4af4f63172927bce0ef704570eae2e56d6837035","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2150\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIf a dag has multiple jobs; and a job failed, the Dag's status should be FAILED. Imagine, another job that was running in parallel passed. This passing job should not emit a FLOW_SUCCEEDED event. Right now, we decide it based on Dag's `flowEvent` field which is not persisted in state store and is also set by the **last finished job** and is also deprecated. In this PR, I am calculating the flow status based on **all the job statuses** of the dag. Individual job statuses are persisted.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nupdated tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-04T22:15:41Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T01:53:02Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T01:53:02Z","merged_at":"2024-09-05T01:53:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"f40bb446b3943f9eb95055a4544b387993672f87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4048/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4048/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4048/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/c4226f4bee37c190f8651db30b6411022d3357a2","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:flowEvent","ref":"flowEvent","sha":"c4226f4bee37c190f8651db30b6411022d3357a2","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2152\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin HDFS writers write to a staging directory, which renames to an output directory, before committing data to the final destination. This is so that commits are atomic and not partially done (unless configured).\r\n\r\nGobblin needs to clean up these directories in order to manage HDFS space properly so that failed jobs do not maintain their files around. It is critical to ensure that deletion is only done to folders that are configured at a job level, so that any folders that may be shared between jobs or concurrently are not deleted mid-execution.\r\n\r\nThis job implements a DeleteActivity which runs after all successful or failed jobs in the ExecuteGobblinWorkflow. It collects work directories to delete in the `GenerateWorkUnitActivity`, so it is unnecessary  to maintain task level delete semantics that are the current default in Gobblin.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-03T23:15:40Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T17:52:40Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T17:52:39Z","merged_at":"2024-09-11T17:52:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"f6eeb533ad757aaa34bfb8e69a833732956f3775","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4047/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4047/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4047/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/629cf22c1292e175d0c898cb2a9c3a5fce318c46","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:cleanup-activity-gobblin-temporal","ref":"cleanup-activity-gobblin-temporal","sha":"629cf22c1292e175d0c898cb2a9c3a5fce318c46","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2148) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2148\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, when GaaS Temporal job are cancelled, only the Azkaban job is stopped, which stops the subsequent YARN application. However, the Temporal job that is submitted by the YARN application is not stopped.\r\nAs part of this PR, we have implemented the cancel flow which should cancel the Temporal workflow upon cancellation of Azkaban job.\r\nThe support for cancellation is added in base class GobblinTemporalJobLauncher. The workflowId is needed for cancellation, thus some changes are made to initialize the workflowId in submitJob, which can then be used for cancellation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- testCancelWorkflowIfFailed\r\n- testCancelWorkflowIfCompleted\r\n- testCancelWorkflowIfRunning\r\n\r\nI have also tested the cancel flow in personal Az project for all 3 cases:\r\n- Cancellation after job completion: Doesn't trigger cancel event to Temporal\r\n- Cancellation before worker started: Results in termination event to Temporal\r\n- Cancellation during workflow execution: \r\n   a) If cancellation completes within 3 seconds, successful cancellation of Temporal workflow\r\n   b) If cancellation takes more than 3 seconds, termination of Temporal workflow\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-03T12:08:08Z","updated_at":"2024-10-07T17:54:39Z","closed_at":"2024-10-07T17:54:39Z","merged_at":"2024-10-07T17:54:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"20c434188ff0715110d5f708b9e16ed8612059c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4045/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4045/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4045/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0f127f5221b7a80755f8154341c209724e5824b8","head":{"label":"abhishekmjain:temporal-workflow-cancel","ref":"temporal-workflow-cancel","sha":"0f127f5221b7a80755f8154341c209724e5824b8","user":{"login":"abhishekmjain","id":16535454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16535454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810140032,"node_id":"R_kgDOMEnBgA","name":"gobblin","full_name":"abhishekmjain/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abhishekmjain","id":16535454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16535454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [✅] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2147 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [✅] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n   - In partitioned file source based copy even if copy.lookbackTime property was passed in config it wasn't used and files from lowest watermark (if passed, otherwise default value was used) were being processed  which can lead to too much processing of files in case granularity isn't configured properly.\r\n   - With this change user can pass \"copy.lookbackTime\" or \"date.partitioned.source.lookback.time\"\r\n   - If in case user doesn't passed values or values are not proper or there is any exception while parsing the property value then it will fallback to watermark values.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [✅] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   - `PartitionAwareFileRetrieverUtilsTest` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [✅] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-01T14:12:43Z","updated_at":"2024-12-09T08:40:14Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4dad6e5b0e067092acf24e700687059dd0c6def","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4044/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4044/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4044/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d0df67e79108264f49cc89804ed12baead7b67b1","head":{"label":"Blazer-007:partition_filesource_log","ref":"partition_filesource_log","sha":"d0df67e79108264f49cc89804ed12baead7b67b1","user":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808042965,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCnB1Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"Blazer-007/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2146\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nInstead of `setFlowEvent`, the proc engine needs to enforce that flow level events are always being emitted for each type of flow. In this scenario, it needs to emit flow level events for cancellation at a flow level so that jobs are properly killed, similar to the DagManager.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-31T15:15:30Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T01:24:36Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T18:04:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"579f860e6b7ca2f81d26988ff11f3af0751c4bbb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4043/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4043/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4043/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ebea80a03c4a5dfcaae11faf3b335f5d8a899d33","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-flow-event-emission-in-cancel-dag-procs","ref":"fix-flow-event-emission-in-cancel-dag-procs","sha":"ebea80a03c4a5dfcaae11faf3b335f5d8a899d33","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2144\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhereas the `AbstractJobLauncher`, used by Gobblin-on-MR, runs the entire job end-to-end, the Gobblin-on-Temporal `GenerateWorkUnitsImpl` activity solely generates WUs w/o actually processing them.  Thus it's far too early to clean anything up in the temp/staging dirs (e.g. task-staging and task-output, used by writers and the commit step). \r\n\r\nEven worse, depending upon config, doing cleanup nonetheless could destabilize other job executions, when those share this same temp/staging area.  Such cross-job \"action-at-a-distance\" is unpredictable and especially challenging even to diagnose.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n`./gradlew build` successful\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-27T21:21:28Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T22:04:32Z","closed_at":"2024-08-27T22:04:32Z","merged_at":"2024-08-27T22:04:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"444f2664be7fb3a44342cc481aaefb46542e8ede","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4039/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4039/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4039/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/cc007afa055aef89a1a8d3cdf33ff7afecd9809b","head":{"label":"phet:avoid-gen-WUs-activity-cleanup","ref":"avoid-gen-WUs-activity-cleanup","sha":"cc007afa055aef89a1a8d3cdf33ff7afecd9809b","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2143\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen a dag is cancelled and multiple ReevaluateDagProcs are being processed for kill dag nodes, all of them will try to delete the dag and insert the dag node state too. this \"insert\" and \"delete\" may create inconsistency in the dag state store.\r\nTo safe guard against this, let only ReevaluateDagProc update the status of a dag node; and it should only UPDATE the status, NOT try to INSERT the dag node.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nupdated tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-26T20:02:10Z","updated_at":"2024-08-29T22:33:58Z","closed_at":"2024-08-29T22:33:58Z","merged_at":"2024-08-29T22:33:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"2695699363acbf8a07df61d6118f560f3839cb81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4038/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4038/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4038/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/319aa5943b8b00614ccba1eded30927a6867cdab","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:updateNode","ref":"updateNode","sha":"319aa5943b8b00614ccba1eded30927a6867cdab","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2142\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThere is an apparent bug in DMSS::hasRunningJobs()\r\nIf in a dag with two sequential jobs, first failed, this method returns true, while it should return false because the second job just cannot run. Because of this bug, ReevaluateDagProc fails to remove dag (or mark it as failed)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded tests in DagManagerUtilTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-25T22:07:31Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T21:43:59Z","closed_at":"2024-08-26T21:43:59Z","merged_at":"2024-08-26T21:43:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"b28b468091e26eb632292ee46fd8aa1e97bbb15e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/2fa8cf66152110742c4dad834779b6c71f12ef0e","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:dpemonitoringfix3.3","ref":"dpemonitoringfix3.3","sha":"2fa8cf66152110742c4dad834779b6c71f12ef0e","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2141\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nSimulation mode in retention relies on the usage of MockTrash, which doesn't always reflect the details of moving trash to certain spaces that the actual Trash class implements, and some of the details of which folders it creates.\r\nThe mock trash class also makes it difficult to simulate behaviors on any classes that extend a part of Trash class since they would have to create a corresponding mock class, which makes the purpose of the simulate mode moot since it's not actually simulating the live behavior.\r\n\r\nWe want to have an opt-in configuration (to not break existing simulation jobs of retention) to have the Trash class log out which files it is moving to its trash location.\r\n\r\nIf a user has `gobblin.retention.simulate=true` and `gobblin.trash.simulate.actual.trash=true`, it will simulate without using the MockTrash class\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-22T21:14:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-23T18:09:10Z","closed_at":"2024-08-23T18:09:08Z","merged_at":"2024-08-23T18:09:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c8127c7aa336f25ea2292346cede3756e3098f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/bb6537479362b571dfa4f9069fc7c2b59980dfe9","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:simulate-directly-on-trash-class","ref":"simulate-directly-on-trash-class","sha":"bb6537479362b571dfa4f9069fc7c2b59980dfe9","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [✔️ ] My PR addresses the following [GOBBLIN-2138](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2138) issues\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [✔️ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    - Table interface provides some api like newReplacePartitions() and new Overwrite() which are not present in tableOperations, so the object of this needs to be created from catalog using loadTable() api of catalog implementation, for that a simple abstract method in BaseIcebergCatalog is added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [✔️ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - Doesn't need any tests, will be adding tests when IcebergTable.java classes will be using this Table instance\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [✔️ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-21T05:15:14Z","updated_at":"2024-10-25T04:32:03Z","closed_at":"2024-10-25T04:31:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59834ed86e1aa471b9214091a157a2e7918ea104","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d629bf0f8e716c4a2eeae1899e87d93c0f0c005d","head":{"label":"Blazer-007:virai_iceberg_loadTable_changes","ref":"virai_iceberg_loadTable_changes","sha":"d629bf0f8e716c4a2eeae1899e87d93c0f0c005d","user":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808042965,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCnB1Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"Blazer-007/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2135\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin YARN Application Launcher lacks some functionality used in MRJobLauncher. One of the biggest gaps in feature parity is the absence of jar caching, where MRJobLauncher creates a monthly cache that is automatically cleaned up by subsequent executions performed 2 months in advance.\r\n\r\nYARN/MR requires uploading jars to HDFS, this step can be quite slow (~15 mins for a sizeable job to get all the jars), and given that many jobs do share the same jars, it makes sense to cache them together and only provide YARN the shared path. \r\n\r\nWe also want to ensure that SNAPSHOT jars are other files are not uploaded to a cache, since they are not immutable unlike jar versions on Artifactory.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements jar caching through 2 configurations:\r\n```\r\ngobblin.yarn.jar.cache.enabled\r\ngobblin.yarn.jar.cache.dir\r\n````\r\nWhere if `gobblin.yarn.jar.cache.enabled=true`, then it will look for the directory defined in `gobblin.yarn.jar.cache.dir`. It is expected that snapshot jars and other files are stored in some directory that is unique to the execution so that those jars will not be shared across other concurrent executions, only jars stored in the jar cache will be.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt is tested that this saves approximately 10 minutes of bootstrap time per job.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-16T02:45:21Z","updated_at":"2024-09-17T21:15:04Z","closed_at":"2024-09-17T21:15:03Z","merged_at":"2024-09-17T21:15:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"a07a4f190d7128f48ba3d956efd4c1b9cf9158f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3aa8a0872254275fc50e4b9bcff73078a8a451cb","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:cache-temporal-jars","ref":"cache-temporal-jars","sha":"3aa8a0872254275fc50e4b9bcff73078a8a451cb","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2129\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe only caller of GobblinServiceJobScheduler::unscheduleSpec was ignoring the exception it throws, so lets throw it. It pollutes log analyzer result that hides real exceptions\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntrivial changes\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-10T19:50:42Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T19:24:46Z","closed_at":"2024-08-12T19:24:46Z","merged_at":"2024-08-12T19:24:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"054279466b2f89e97d65c04599af749440b19c84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9c29e984bfd7e15fd9e3f47c67abb29d10c35d4c","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:exception","ref":"exception","sha":"9c29e984bfd7e15fd9e3f47c67abb29d10c35d4c","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

with equal file depths\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2128\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n`SetPermissionCommitStep` has a bug where it does not handle paths with the same file depth appropriately.\r\nIf directories of the same nested path have different permissions, they can lead to unknown behavior as the key equality is incorrect here and doesn't maintain both separate paths/permissions.\r\n\r\nThe key comparator: \r\n```\r\nLong.compare(o1.chars().filter(ch -> ch == '/').count(), o2.chars().filter(ch -> ch == '/').count())\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould be replaced with:\r\n```\r\nComparator.comparingInt((String o) -> o.split(\"/\").length).thenComparing(o -> o)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, build the paths and permissions from the existing map instead of re-reading from FS to reduce FS calls and ensure consistency.\r\n\r\nAdd a setting to disable this permission step with the configuration \r\n```\r\ngobblin.copy.manifestBased.enableSetPermissionPostPublish\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-09T21:36:22Z","updated_at":"2024-08-11T19:06:20Z","closed_at":"2024-08-11T19:06:18Z","merged_at":"2024-08-11T19:06:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"eaed5825a3e7a5d94361fa56d0fcf9c69c85d911","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4020/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4020/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4020/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/601db1d91c46345a2cee8dd59f72ff869ee09a04","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:rework-setpermission-fix-treemap","ref":"rework-setpermission-fix-treemap","sha":"601db1d91c46345a2cee8dd59f72ff869ee09a04","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2127\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen a job fails, it is marked as PENDING_RETRY when its currentAttempt is less than maxAttempts.\r\nFor such status, creating GaaSObservabilityEvent was producing NPE.\r\nThe approach in this PR is to not update job status to PENDING_RETRY before calculating `updatedJobStatus = recalcJobStatus()`\r\nand then emit GaaSObservabilityEvent only if a retry is not required.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nupdated the current tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-07T19:07:48Z","updated_at":"2024-08-07T22:18:27Z","closed_at":"2024-08-07T22:18:27Z","merged_at":"2024-08-07T22:18:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"977928ed3ecee82bd44132906312c088f1d5ca28","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/77d03529b4b076e1c90f70ff9d2d3027b5b7d107","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:obs","ref":"obs","sha":"77d03529b4b076e1c90f70ff9d2d3027b5b7d107","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2125\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAlthough the logic was removed in https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3988/files, it is still needed to ensure proper permission setting from src and dest.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises where a manifest describes a file to copy, but as the dataset is locked, the ancestor permission check will re-write the folder in destination to have the locked permissions. We only want to apply the `SetPermissionCommitStep` to newly created folders as those folders on destination may have an extra execution bit.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-06T22:36:09Z","updated_at":"2024-08-07T18:37:37Z","closed_at":"2024-08-06T23:49:18Z","merged_at":"2024-08-06T23:49:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"4543e02b8d8a28cbf0c289f303b0be55b0a647ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/420cff077c5d53508cc1a9e3c2e2cadd1d31ed77","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:remove-setpermission-set-preexisting-folders","ref":"remove-setpermission-set-preexisting-folders","sha":"420cff077c5d53508cc1a9e3c2e2cadd1d31ed77","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [GOBBLIN-2118](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2118) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Add a default method in kafkaConsumerClient to allow fetching earliest offsets for a list of partition at a time. This needs to be overridden by the Kafka Consumer client implementation to call the actual API to fetch the parititions. \r\n- [x] Changes in KafkaSource to create workunits while fetching all the kafka offsets for a topic at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Tested the changes by creating the flow with 2 topics (having 256 partitions) and could see the latency decreased by ~50% while fetching the parititons offset from the kafka broker. \r\n- [x] Added UTs to test if the new method added to fetch offsets is being invoked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-23T04:44:38Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T19:20:31Z","closed_at":"2024-08-06T19:20:31Z","merged_at":"2024-08-06T19:20:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"e501b62ffe646885d8b33198737bc16d38c04ba3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4009/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4009/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4009/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0e7c0540cccf82ccea6221bd478831c73d703e31","head":{"label":"arpit09:reduceNetworkCallsToKafka","ref":"reduceNetworkCallsToKafka","sha":"0e7c0540cccf82ccea6221bd478831c73d703e31","user":{"login":"arpit09","id":9762455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjI0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9762455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09","html_url":"https://github.com/arpit09","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":754462131,"node_id":"R_kgDOLPgtsw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arpit09/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arpit09","id":9762455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjI0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9762455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09","html_url":"https://github.com/arpit09","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arpit09/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2119\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIf the service restarts before we call conclude on the lease, the deadline dag actions may get entered into the dag action store. The launch dag task (that creates deadline dag actions) will be retried on service start. It is not ideal to launch a job twice. When the job is launched again, it tries to store the deadline dag actions again and fails due to Primary Key constraint. We should ignore this exception otherwise the job submission will keep on being retried.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntrivial changes\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-23T00:59:29Z","updated_at":"2024-07-23T20:42:40Z","closed_at":"2024-07-23T20:42:39Z","merged_at":"2024-07-23T20:42:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ea96226cedbc8286952029101d8acb82cecadc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4008/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4008/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4008/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/546dc74ba6d79951c0ad953b7b6a5ed12c1060b7","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:ignore","ref":"ignore","sha":"546dc74ba6d79951c0ad953b7b6a5ed12c1060b7","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2117\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n` No meter exists for dagActionType ENFORCE_JOB_START_DEADLINE in metricsMap {}`\r\nInitialize metrics map for each `dagActionType` in default constructor of `DagProcessingEngineMetrics`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdds two unit tests that use this default constructor and tries to mark every dagAction for the two metrics, dagActionsStored and dagActionsObserved (the other tests are trivial). \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-22T18:35:36Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T20:32:29Z","closed_at":"2024-07-22T20:32:29Z","merged_at":"2024-07-22T20:32:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"e68b62e739976a3d370d0501fdf27c67fd784846","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4007/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4007/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4007/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/6f1531900b5a3275a811c58dea1103b064fe96a5","head":{"label":"umustafi:umustafi/initializeDagProcEngineMetrics","ref":"umustafi/initializeDagProcEngineMetrics","sha":"6f1531900b5a3275a811c58dea1103b064fe96a5","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn Iceberg and File retention, the field `FsCleanableHelper.RETENTION_DATASET_ROOT` is added in order to send metadata about the table to the retention job to compute trash locations. We want to maintain this behavior for Hive retention.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdding property only\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2113\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAfter changing `flowExecutionId` from a Str to a long in a previous PR, we encounter `NumberFormatException` in the `DagActionStoreChangeMonitor` when processing HB events. This ends up killing the `HighLevelConsumer` queues for the hosts that receive the HB events in their partition. \r\n```\r\n{{Encountered exception while processing record so stopping queue processing.

After updating its values the test failed locally \r\n\r\n```\r\nGradle suite > Gradle test > org.apache.gobblin.runtime.DagActionStoreChangeMonitorTest > testProcessMessageWithHeartbeatAndNullDagAction FAILED\r\n    java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"\"\r\n        at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)\r\n        at java.lang.Long.parseLong(Long.java:601)\r\n        at java.lang.Long.parseLong(Long.java:631)\r\n        at org.apache.gobblin.service.monitoring.DagActionStoreChangeMonitor.processMessage(DagActionStoreChangeMonitor.java:203)\r\n        at org.apache.gobblin.runtime.DagActionStoreChangeMonitorTest$MockDagActionStoreChangeMonitor.processMessageForTest(DagActionStoreChangeMonitorTest.java:97)\r\n        at org.apache.gobblin.runtime.DagActionStoreChangeMonitorTest.testProcessMessageWithHeartbeatAndNullDagAction(DagActionStoreChangeMonitorTest.java:139)\r\nFailed tests:\r\n[org.apache.gobblin.runtime.DagActionStoreChangeMonitorTest::testProcessMessageWithHeartbeatAndNullDagAction\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt passes after the update. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-16T20:15:18Z","updated_at":"2024-07-17T01:22:42Z","closed_at":"2024-07-17T01:22:41Z","merged_at":"2024-07-17T01:22:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ab5b33f3125f503d59ffce8d281c7cc7aba1483","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4004/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/4004/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/4004/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/15da707862baf392d9d4f13827b849455a16b531","head":{"label":"umustafi:handleHeartbeatCDCEvent","ref":"handleHeartbeatCDCEvent","sha":"15da707862baf392d9d4f13827b849455a16b531","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2115\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\ncreated interface DagStateStoreWithDagNodes that add some APIs related to dag nodes to `DagStateStore`.\r\nMysqlDagStateStoreWithDagNodes implements DagStateStoreWithDagNodes. \r\nsome apis that are not used by dag proc engine are not implemented in MysqlDagStateStoreWithDagNodes , which makes using dag proc engine a pre requisite to switch from MysqlDagStateStore to MysqlDagStateStoreWithDagNodes\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded/updated tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-12T02:12:55Z","updated_at":"2024-07-18T21:07:25Z","closed_at":"2024-07-18T21:07:25Z","merged_at":"2024-07-18T21:07:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f0e53792fde7f852a808f73f9fc32a627fd2b71","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/08a25dc0eb46a33b2e74ea9af53457ed7c932dd1","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:dnss","ref":"dnss","sha":"08a25dc0eb46a33b2e74ea9af53457ed7c932dd1","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

scheduler for reminder jobs\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2108\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nQuartzSchduler cannot instantiate ReminderJob because in the last commit, I changed it from static to non-static inner class (to achieve something). This is not allowed in java without creating the outer class.\r\nIn order to create ReminderJob without creating the outer DagActionReminderScheduler class, I am adding a ReminderJobFactory.\r\nBecause we do not want FlowSpec scheduler to use this factory, we want to do this in a different scheduler, so creating a different one for DagActionReminderScheduler.\r\nrevert changes in SchedulerService made in PR#3890 because i think those were unnecessary\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadd a unit test to verify normal scheuler and the one in DagActionReminderScheduler create different schedulers and they both run and complete their jobs.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-11T20:27:36Z","updated_at":"2024-07-15T15:52:09Z","closed_at":"2024-07-15T15:52:09Z","merged_at":"2024-07-15T15:52:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f9dd3cf665ec9a87edbd0f14baa8894e9a66b3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/6ade41b9feb906f2018ff76694e44cb4d47820f5","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:scheduler","ref":"scheduler","sha":"6ade41b9feb906f2018ff76694e44cb4d47820f5","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.
