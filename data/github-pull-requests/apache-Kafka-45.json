prepare Java 21 support, upgrade gradle, its plugins and test libraries.\r\nRelease notes for major and minor updates included below.\r\n\r\nThe highlight is faster Java compilation by not shutting down the daemon at the end of the build.\r\nGradle's internal performance tests show up to a 30% build time improvement for builds that are\r\ndominated by compiling Java sources.\r\n\r\nMockito turns out to be a complex case where we use one of 3 different versions depending on\r\nthe Scala and Java versions used. In addition, the default mocking strategy changed from `subclass`\r\nto `inline` in Mockito 5.0. We now use `inline` across the board (we previously used both `subclass`\r\nand `inline`). See comments in the relevant parts of the code for more details.\r\n\r\n* Gradle 8.3 release notes: https://docs.gradle.org/8.3/release-notes.html\r\n* jmh 1.37: virtual thread support and various bug

on the `quorum.fetch.timeout.ms` config, and if the leader did not receive Fetch requests from a majority of the quorum for that amount of time, it would begin a new election, to resolve the network partition in the quorum. But we missed this implementation in current KRaft. Fixed it in this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR did:\r\n1. Added a fetchTimer with fetchTimeout in `LeaderState`, and check if expired each time when leader poll. If expired, resigning the leadership and start a new election.\r\n2. Added `fetchedVoters` in `LeaderState`, and update the value each time received a fetchRequest, and clear it and reset fetchTimer if the majority of fetchRequest received.\r\n3. Added tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

Suppress warning if fixing would potentially result in an incompatible change (for public classes)\r\n2. Add final to one or more methods so that the escape is not possible\r\n3. Replace method calls with direct field access.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we also fix a couple of compiler warnings related to deprecated references in the `core` module.\r\n\r\nSee the following for more

Introduces `FetchRequestManager` that implements the `RequestManager` API for fetching messages from brokers. Unlike `Fetcher`, record decompression and deserialization is performed on the application thread inside `CompletedFetch`.\r\n2. Restructured the code so that objects owned by the background thread are not instantiated until the background thread runs (via `Supplier`) to ensure that there are no references available to the application thread.\r\n3. Ensuring resources are properly using `Closeable` and using `IdempotentCloser` to ensure they're only closed once.\r\n4. Introduces `ConsumerTestBuilder` to reduce a lot of inconsistency in the way the objects were built up for tests.","created_at":"2023-09-19T17:26:32Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T00:14:46Z","closed_at":"2023-10-24T20:03:05Z","merged_at":"2023-10-24T20:03:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b233bfa5f35bf237effe8c5202fd2b80c601943","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5536940330,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSgcBKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ctr","name":"ctr","color":"554CC1","default":false,"description":"Consumer

patch refactors the ReplicaManager.appendRecords method and the AddPartitionsToTxnManager class in order to move the logic to identify the transaction coordinator based on the transaction id from the former to the latter. While working on KAFKA-14505, I found pretty annoying that we require to pass the transaction state partition to appendRecords because we have to do the same from the group coordinator. It seems preferable to delegate that job to the AddPartitionsToTxnManager.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

this PR, we noticed failed tests caused by the verification of log start offset and local log start offset.

I think there must be some bugs/gaps between java/scala that causes these issue. We can fix it by not using `varargs`, instead, using the `Seq`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds back the log start offset and local log start offset verification, and make sure all tests passed.\r\n\r\n###

implement this, the following AdminClient APIs now support the new bootstrap.controllers\r\nconfiguration:\r\n    - Admin.alterConfigs\r\n    - Admin.describeCluster\r\n    - Admin.describeConfigs\r\n    - Admin.describeFeatures\r\n    - Admin.describeMetadataQuorum\r\n    - Admin.incrementalAlterConfigs\r\n    - Admin.updateFeatures\r\n\r\nCommand-line tool changes:\r\n    - Add CommandLineUtils.initializeBootstrapProperties to handle parsing --bootstrap-controller\r\n      in addition to --bootstrap-server.\r\n    - Add --bootstrap-controller to ConfigCommand.scala, ClusterTool.java, FeatureCommand.java, and\r\n      MetadataQuorumCommand.java.\r\n\r\nKafkaAdminClient changes:\r\n    - Add the AdminBootstrapAddresses class to handle extracting bootstrap.servers or\r\n      bootstrap.controllers from the config map for KafkaAdminClient.\r\n    - In AdminMetadataManager, store the new usingBootstrapControllers boolean. Generalize\r\n      authException to encompass the concept of fatal exceptions in general. (For example, the\r\n      fatal exception where we talked to the wrong node type.) Treat\r\n      MismatchedEndpointTypeException and UnsupportedEndpointTypeException as fatal exceptions.\r\n    - Extend NodeProvider to include information about whether bootstrap.controllers is supported.\r\n    - Modify the APIs described above to support bootstrap.controllers.\r\n\r\nServer-side changes:\r\n    - Support DescribeConfigsRequest on kcontrollers.\r\n    - Add KRaftMetadataCache to the kcontroller to simplify implemeting describeConfigs (and\r\n      probably more APIs in the future). It's mainly a wrapper around MetadataImage, so there is\r\n      essentially no extra resource consumption.\r\n    - Split RuntimeLoggerManager out of ConfigAdminManager to handle the incrementalAlterConfigs\r\n      support for BROKER_LOGGER. This is now supported on kcontrollers as well as brokers.\r\n    - Fix bug in AuthHelper.computeDescribeClusterResponse that resulted in us always sending back\r\n      BROKER as the endpoint type, even on the kcontroller.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\n    - Fix a few places in exceptions and log messages where we wrote \"broker\" instead of \"node\".\r\n      For example, an exception in NodeApiVersions.java, and a log message in NetworkClient.java.\r\n    - Fix the slf4j log prefix used by KafkaRequestHandler logging so that request handlers on a\r\n      controller don't look like they're on a broker.\r\n    - Make the FinalizedVersionRange constructor public for the sake of a junit test.\r\n    - Add unit and integration tests for the above.","created_at":"2023-09-19T00:03:18Z","updated_at":"2024-04-17T03:01:59Z","closed_at":"2023-09-26T21:43:43Z","merged_at":"2023-09-26T21:43:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"fcac880fd54efbec3fe385000cf990a19972dafa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14399/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14399/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14399/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/985f7921b54937c99fda0a97374b9f1a82f43654","head":{"label":"cmccabe:cmccabe_kip_919_part_2","ref":"cmccabe_kip_919_part_2","sha":"985f7921b54937c99fda0a97374b9f1a82f43654","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

#14089 the PluginDesc::compareTo method was changed, such that plugins with the same name and version but different classloaders could be given a consistent order. This caused compareTo to return non-zero values where previously it returned zero.\r\n\r\nThe compareTo method is used by TreeSet to determine uniqueness in lieu of the more typical equals() in other Set implementations. This means that the PluginScanResult now stored multiple copies of a plugin with the same \"name\", which was beneficial for the connect-plugin-path script where the distinction was valuable. DelegatingClassLoader::computePluginLoaders already disambiguates among multiple PluginDescs for the same plugin name by picking the \"last\" one, as defined by compareTo.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ConnectorPluginsResource does not disambiguate in the same way, and instead just forwards the list of plugins as PluginInfo objects, which contain only the class, type, and version of the plugin. This means that when a plugin is provided by multiple sources but with the exact same class, type, and version, the `/connector-plugins` endpoint contains confusing duplicates.\r\n\r\nInstead of showing duplicates without any information to distinguish them, we should hide the trivial duplicates (duplicates where PluginInfo::equals is true). In order to verify this, the ConnectorPluginsResourceTest is changed to assert on the returned List rather than a Set, to detect duplicates.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

Introduces `FetchRequestManager` that implements the `RequestManager` API for fetching messages from brokers. Unlike `Fetcher`, record decompression and deserialization is performed on the application thread inside `CompletedFetch`.\r\n2. Restructured the code so that objects owned by the background thread are not instantiated until the background thread runs (via `Supplier`) to ensure that there are no references available to the application thread.\r\n3. Ensuring resources are properly using `Closeable` and using `IdempotentCloser` to ensure they're only closed once.\r\n4. Introduces `ConsumerTestBuilder` to reduce a lot of inconsistency in the way the objects were built up for tests.","created_at":"2023-09-18T20:33:22Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T00:17:17Z","closed_at":"2023-09-19T17:26:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a9e9292482c93368e2753a2b54756716730152d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5536940330,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSgcBKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ctr","name":"ctr","color":"554CC1","default":false,"description":"Consumer

Introduce an \"inactive\" state\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are planning to replace GroupState with MembershipManager as the latter already includes the necessary fields (`groupId`, `groupInstanceId`). This patch is a minor refactor of swapping the two components as the follow up of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14364\r\n\r\nHowever, during the patching, we've realized the heartbeat will be sent continuously unless the member enters a fatal state.  This needs to be patched up because the member should be able to join/leave a group at anytime during its life cycle.","created_at":"2023-09-14T18:10:41Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T00:49:55Z","closed_at":"2023-12-20T00:49:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b42797ce97d9a59262feb9a5e74eb01926bd349f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

patch copy over existing metrics and add new consumer group metrics to the new GroupCoordinatorService.\r\n\r\nNow that each coordinator is responsible for a topic partition, this patch introduces a `GroupCoordinatorMetrics` that records gauges for global metrics such as the number of generic groups in PreparingRebalance state, etc. For `GroupCoordinatorShard` specific metrics, GroupCoordinatorMetrics will activate new `GroupCoordinatorMetricsShard`s that will be responsible for incrementing/decrementing TimelineLong objects and then aggregate the total amount across all shards.\r\n\r\nAs the CoordinatorRuntime/CoordinatorShard does not care about group metadata, we have introduced a `CoordinatorMetrics.java/CoordinatorMetricsShard.java` so that in the future

Part 1 tries to address hanging transactions on old clients. Thus, the produce version can not be bumped and no new errors can be added. Currently we use the java client's notion of retriable and abortable errors -- retriable errors are defined as such by extending the retriable error class, fatal errors are defined explicitly, and abortable errors are the remaining. However, many other clients treat non specified errors as fatal and that means many retriable errors kill the application. \r\n\r\nWe are stuck between having specific errors for Java clients that are handled correctly (ie we retry) or specific fatal errors for cases that should not be fatal. We opted for a middle ground of non-specific error, but a message in the response to specify.\r\n\r\nConverting some of the coordinator error codes to NOT_ENOUGH_REPLICAS which is a known produce response.\r\nAlso correctly add the old errors to the produce response. (We were not doing this correctly before)\r\n\r\nAdded tests for the new errors and messages.\r\nViewing without whitespace changes may be useful.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

information provided by KafkaConfig can be incomplete in two ways. One is that endpoints using ephemeral ports will show up as using port 0. Another is that endpoints binding to 0.0.0.0 will show up with a null or blank hostname. Because we were not accounting for this in controller registration, it was leading to a null pointer dereference when we tried to register a controller using an endpoint defined as PLAINTEXT://:9092.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a ListenerInfo class which can fix both of the causes of incomplete endpoint information. It also handles serialization to and from various RPC and record formats. This allows us to remove a lot of boilerplate code and standardize the handling of listeners between BrokerServer and

this issue while investigating [KAFKA-15453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15453). The config: `remote.log.metadata.initialization.retry.interval.ms` controls the interval of retrying RemoteLogMetadataManager resources initialization when init failure. Default is 5 seconds. \r\n\r\nThe init failure will happen frequently in scenarios like, 3 brokers start 1 by 1, and when the first 2 brokers start up, it'll fail when RLMM topic creation since no enough brokers to allocation 3 replicas. Then, retrying after 5 seconds. Under these 5 seconds gap, these 2 brokers cannot write/read to/from remote storage, which is not a good UX. It'd better we reduce the default value to make tiered storage feature available ASAP.\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces the default 5 seconds to 1 second. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

for https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14347 .\r\n\r\n==\r\nThis PR did:\r\n1. enable `testFencingOnTransactionExpiration`\r\n2. Verify the log start offset and local log start offset before and after committing/aborting txn, to make sure we will move the segment to remote storage after last stable offset advanced.\r\n\r\nFor (1), the reason the test failed before because:\r\n1. RLMM is not ready since `remote.log.metadata.initialization.retry.interval.ms` is too long to wait for retrying initialization. Reducing it to 200 ms to fix the issue.\r\n2. Even though we extends the `TransactionsTest`, we didn't inherit some changes in the class initialization. And that causes the test doesn't run as we expected, ex: `TransactionsTopicPartitionsProp` is using 50 in tiered storage case, but it should be 3... etc. Fixed it by inherit all configs in parent class now.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-12T09:06:30Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T07:40:26Z","closed_at":"2023-09-21T07:40:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a26b1ce4fee5fa5530f38876553ffda94dc26481","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"satishd","id":2577761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd","html_url":"https://github.com/satishd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5624487963,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTz7gGw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tiered-storage","name":"tiered-storage","color":"B8FE9B","default":false,"description":"Related

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14855:\r\n\r\n> In the Connect embedded integration testing framework, the [EmbeddedConnectClusterAssertions::assertConnectorAndTasksAreStopped method](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/31440b00f3ed8de65f368d41d6cf2efb07ca4a5c/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/util/clusters/EmbeddedConnectClusterAssertions.java#L411-L428) is used in several places to verify that a connector has been deleted. (This method may be renamed in an upcoming PR to something like assertConnectorAndTasksAreNotRunning, but apart from that, its usage and semantics will remain unchanged.) However, the [underlying logic for that assertion](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/31440b00f3ed8de65f368d41d6cf2efb07ca4a5c/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/util/clusters/EmbeddedConnectClusterAssertions.java#L430-L451) doesn't strictly check for deletion (which can be done by verifying that the connector and its tasks no longer appear in the REST API at all), since it also allows for the Connector or tasks to appear in the REST API, but with a state that is not RUNNING.\r\n>\r\n> This constraint is a bit too lax and may be silently masking issues with our shutdown logic for to-be-deleted connectors. We should try to narrow the criteria for that method so that it fails if the Connector or any of its tasks still appear in the REST API, even with a non-RUNNING state.\r\n>\r\n> However, we should also be careful to ensure that current uses of that method are not relying on its semantics. If, for some reason, a test case requires the existing semantics, we should evaluate whether it's necessary to continue to rely on those semantics, and if so, probably preserve the existing method so that it can be used wherever applicable (but rewrite all other tests to use the new, stricter method).\r\n\r\n- All usages of the `assertConnectorAndTasksAreNotRunning` method were to check for connector deletion so the assertion on non-running status of connectors and tasks isn't required.\r\n- This patch removes that unnecessary extra assertion and hardens the logic for asserting that a connector is deleted.\r\n- Note that `assertConnectorAndTasksAreNotRunning` (now renamed to `assertConnectorDoesNotExist`) only verifies that the connector has been wiped from the status backing store which is done by the leader worker after the post-deletion group rebalance. We don't verify whether the connectors and tasks have actually finished stopping - this is potentially a further improvement that could be made in the future.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

continues the work of providing the groundwork for the [fetch refactoring work](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14274) by introducing some new classes and refactoring the existing code to use the new classes where applicable.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n* Minor clean up of the events classes to make data immutable, private, and implement `toString()`.\r\n* Added `IdempotentCloser` which prevents a resource from being closed more than once. It's general enough that it could be used elsewhere in the project, but it's limited to the consumer internals for now.\r\n* Extract inner classes from `AbstractFetch`  into top-level classes to a) buffer raw results (`FetchBuffer`), and b) collect raw results into `ConsumerRecords` (`FetchCollector`). These can be tested and changed in isolation from the core fetcher logic.\r\n* Added `NodeStatusDetector` which abstracts methods from `ConsumerNetworkClient` so that it and `NetworkClientDelegate` can be used in `AbstractFetch` via the interface instead of using `ConsumerNetworkClient` directly.","created_at":"2023-09-08T16:23:27Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T00:17:15Z","closed_at":"2023-09-16T16:15:38Z","merged_at":"2023-09-16T16:15:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1dc6d9f3493eb35e3d3eef1d70c2d1fc94d74c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5536940330,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABSgcBKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ctr","name":"ctr","color":"554CC1","default":false,"description":"Consumer

patch allows broker heartbeat events to be completed while a metadata transaction is in-flight.\r\n\r\nWhile a metadata transaction is in progress, events added to the purgatory will not be completed because the \"stable\" offset will not be advancing. For ZK migrations, the transaction can be very large and take up to several minutes to complete (for very large clusters). This was causing heartbeats to sit on the purgatory and not get completed before the session expiration. This resulted in the controller fencing all the ZK brokers which has undesirable downstream effects.","created_at":"2023-09-06T17:18:39Z","updated_at":"2023-09-08T20:36:14Z","closed_at":"2023-09-08T20:36:13Z","merged_at":"2023-09-08T20:36:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"b24ccd65b7ae9585de19a9cc1b2bf6a10a542cd8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/6fbc2d995703bc069d33f19abf6efc622ac22e72","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-15441-broker-session-timeout","ref":"KAFKA-15441-broker-session-timeout","sha":"6fbc2d995703bc069d33f19abf6efc622ac22e72","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

the partitions offsets.  \r\n- Minor refactoring to extract functionality that is reused from both consumer implementations (moving logic without changes from `OffsetFetcher` into `OffsetFetchUtils`,
