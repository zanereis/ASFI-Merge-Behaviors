Change Logs\r\n\r\nHudi has a requirement to set record keys/primary keys by the user. But some use-cases like ingesting log events, users may not have any column that can act as a primary key field. So, would be good to expose an auto generation record keys internally within hudi for such immutable use-cases.¬†\r\nSo, adding keyless support to Hudi in this patch. In other words, adding auto generation of record keys to Hudi. \r\n\r\nTo discuss: \r\n- should we make the new config a table config? so that users may not be able to switch from auto generated keys to something else later in the lifecycle of a table. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers no longer need to set primary key/record key fields for immutable use-cases or similar workloads and let hudi generate keys internally. Understandably, few configs/operations are not supported in this flow like updates, de-dup are not supported. Even if users set operation type to \"upsert\", hudi is going to ingest the new incoming records as inserts, just that its gonna incur additional index lookup latency w/o much use. \r\n\r\nTo leverage this, users need to enable a new config `hoodie.auto.generate.record.keys` \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nMight have to add a FAQ or website update on the keyless support. \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [

the beginning, we bootstrap the ckp metadata by cleaning all the messages. This brings in some corner case like 'the write task can not fetch the pending instant correctly when restartting the job', if a checkpoint succeed and the job crashes suddenly, the instant hasn't had time to commit, then the data loss happens, because the last pending instant would be rolled back, while the Flink engin thinks the checkpint/instant is successful.\r\n\r\nQ: Why we clean the messages here ?\r\nA: To prevent inconsistencies between timeline and the messages.\r\n\r\nQ: Why we decide to keep the messages ?\r\nA: There are two cases for the inconsistency:\r\n\r\n1. the timeline instant is complete but the ckp message is inflight (for committing instant);\r\n2. the timeline instant is pending while the ckp message does not start (for starting a new instant);\r\n\r\nFor case1, there is no need to re-commit the instant, so it's okey the write task does not get any pending instant when recovering, for case2, the instant is basically pending, it would be rolled back which is in line with expectations. so keeping the ckp messages as is can actually maintain correctness.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nKeep the ckp messages instead of cleaning it.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nGCS might create some marker files for log files created by hudi. While constructing the file groups w/ log files, we should ignore such files. Format of those marker file is \"_GCS_SYNCABLE_TEMPFILE_\" + [LOG_FILE_NAME]. Eg: \"_GCS_SYNCABLE_TEMPFILE_.files-0000_20230104082331173001.log.10_0-52-553.1.8170c3dc-f1f0-474f-aabf-b53a474aa18d\".\r\n\r\nWe did make an attempt to fix [before](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7393), but looks like the file pattern is different. So, have made the pattern match more strict. \r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the Log file pattern match to ensure we ignore such extraneous files.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nQueries and compaction may not fail occationally. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhile following up and adding support for BrooklynData Benchmarks we've discovered that CTAS isn't properly propagating configs due to a recent change in [#5178](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5178/files#diff-560283e494c8ba8da102fc217a2201220dd4db731ec23d80884e0f001a7cc0bcR117)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately logic of handling the configuration in `ProvidesHoodieConfig` become overly complicated and fragmented. \r\n\r\nThis PR takes a stab at it trying to unify and streamline fusing the options from different sources (Spark Catalog props, Table properties, Spark SQL conf, overrides, etc) making sure different Spark SQL operations do handle it in much the same way (for ex, `MERGE INTO`, CTAS, `INSERT INTO`, etc)\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n\r\n - Simplify and unify `ProvidesHoodieConfig` configuration fusion from different sources\r\n - Fixing CTAS to override \"hoodie.combine.before.insert\" as \"false\"\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes discrepancies in the ways configuration is handled across different Spark SQL commands addressing some of the issues stemming from this (for ex, CTAS using \"insert\" write operation instead of \"bulk_insert\")\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis fix is to cover issue as follows. \r\n\r\nI am working on ingestion with S3 as source by following this [blog](https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2021/08/23/s3-events-source/) . But 2nd job(S3EventsHoodieIncrSource)  failing with\r\n`HoodieException: org.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieException: Path does not exist`.  In our investigation, we have observed job failing due to encoded characters( these are being added by SQS) in S3 object name.\r\nWhen we deep dive in Hudi source code , we have observed Hudi decoding them in [S3EventsMetaSelector](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/sources/helpers/S3EventsMetaSelector.java#L154) & at the movement only =  have handled.\r\nFYI-\r\nOriginal S3 object : `s3://<bucket>/s3_parquet_source_data/s3-test+0+0000061344.parquet`\r\nEncoded S3 object: `s3://<bucket>/s3_parquet_source_data/s3-test%2B0%2B0000061344.parquet`\r\nNote: workflow was running successfully if file name corrected.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Risk

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the archival for the metadata table uses the earliest instant of all actions from the active timeline of the data table.  In the archival process, CLEAN and ROLLBACK instants are archived separately apart from commits (check HoodieTimelineArchiver#getCleanInstantsToArchive).  Because of this, a very old completed CLEAN or ROLLBACK instant in the data table can block the archive of the metadata table timeline and causes the active timeline of the metadata table to be extremely long, leading to performance issues for loading the timeline.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the archival in metadata table to not rely on completed rollback or clean in data table, by archiving the metadata table's instants after the earliest commit (COMMIT, DELTA_COMMIT, and REPLACE_COMMIT only, considering non-savepoint commit only if enabling archive beyond savepoint) and the earliest inflight instant (all actions) in the data table's active timeline.\r\n\r\nNew tests are added and an existing test around the archival in the metadata table is adjusted to verify that the archival in the metadata table does not depend on the completed rollback in the data table.\r\n\r\nThis PR is tested locally to ensure the metadata table's archival works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes the active timeline of the metadata table shorter and improves the performance of loading the active timeline of the metadata table.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nUpdate the SchemaRegistryProvider to take in kafka-like configs for truststore and keystore. \r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nTo test this, I modified the examples from Oracle's [Sample Code Illustrating a Secure Socket Connection Between a Client and a Server](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/security/sample-code-illustrating-secure-socket-connection-client-and-server.htm#JSSEC-GUID-A4D59ABB-62AF-4FC0-900E-A795FDC84E41) to work similarly to the SchemaRegistryProvider code. To set up the client and server truststore and keystore, I followed the guide from [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47565937). Note that you should make common name 'localhost'. In step 4, the password that goes in the command line parameter is the PEM pass phrase. Additionally in steps 7 and 8 you are setting the truststore passwords even though you will be prompted to set a keystore password.\r\n[ClassFileServer.java](https://github.com/jonvex/hudi/blob/f86486880c9f070768dbf783a344ccc145c17b84/hudi-examples/hudi-examples-java/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/examples/java/ClassFileServer.java)\r\n[ClassServer.java](https://github.com/jonvex/hudi/blob/f86486880c9f070768dbf783a344ccc145c17b84/hudi-examples/hudi-examples-java/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/examples/java/ClassServer.java)\r\n[SSLSocketClient.java](https://github.com/jonvex/hudi/blob/f86486880c9f070768dbf783a344ccc145c17b84/hudi-examples/hudi-examples-java/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/examples/java/SSLSocketClient.java)\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the Hudi archived timeline is always loaded during the metastore sync process if the last sync time is given. Besides, the archived timeline is not cached inside the meta client if the start instant time is given. These cause performance issues and read timeout on cloud storage due to rate limiting on requests because of loading archived timeline from the storage, when the archived timeline is huge, e.g., hundreds of log files in `.hoodie/archived` folder.  Such behavior is introduced by #6662.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the timeline loading by\r\n(1) only reading active timeline if the last sync time is the same as or after the start of the active timeline;\r\n(2) caching the archived timeline based on the start instant time in the meta client, to avoid unnecessary repeated loading of the same archived timeline.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the performance of metastore sync.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCompaction in metadata table (MDT) is triggered only when there are no pending inflight instants apart from the one that's currently updating (let's say C3) the MDT. The current code only checks for inflight instants before C3. Instead we need to check any inflights compared to latest detla commit. bcoz, thats what is used as compaction instant's base time. This PR fixes that behavior.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMDT compaction.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf user has set `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.metastore.uris` to a remote metastore but `hive.metastore.uris` in hadoop conf is not set, then sync will succeed to embedded metastore and the tables won't be visible in remote metastore. This makes the user think that sync was successful, yet tables are not found. This PR fixes that behavior.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImpacts meta sync (hive sync only).\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

occur.\r\n\r\n - Fixing `HoodieClientTestHarness` to properly init `SparkSession` so that `HoodieSparkSessionExtensions` are injected properly\r\n - Converted all custom Hudi relations to be case-classes (to make them immutable)\r\n - Implement projection being able to project nested structs as well\r\n - Cleaning up\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAddresses issue w/ MOR tables where after applying NSP optimization, it would fail to read in case delta-log merging will nee d to happen\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFetching virtual key involves reading from commit metadata or data file (`TableSchemaResolver`) which is a costly operation. This is only needed for schema projection in the case of MOR table (realtime splits). So, we can avoid it in case of COW table.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is stacked on top of #7526 \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves performance of hive-compatible query engines that depend on input format implementation in Hudi, e.g. trino-hive connector.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn the current bucket mechanism, the number of buckets in each partition is the same. If the partition data is skewed, a larger bucket will be allocated to the smaller partition This will generate many small files, so you want to set different buckets for different partitions\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIn the multi-level partition scenario, the data of each partition may be skewed. If you uniformly set the same number of buckets for each partition, this will cause some small files.So I hope to support setting different buckets for different partitions.\r\nsuch as:

(#7509)\r\n\r\nDifferent with other write clients, HoodieFlinkWriteClient invokes the dataset writing methods(#upsert or #insert) for each batch of new data set in the long running task. In current impl, a engine-specific hoodie table would be created before performing these actions, and before the table creation, some table bootstrapping operations are performed(such as table upgrade/downgrade, the metadata table bootstrap). These bootstrapping operations are guarded by a trasanction lock.\r\n\r\nIn Flink, these bootstrapping operations can be avoided because they are all performed only once on the coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe changes:\r\n\r\n- Make BaseHoodieWriteClient#doInitTable non abstract, it now only performs the bootstrapping operations\r\n- Add a default impl BaseHoodieWriteClient#initMetadataTable for metadata table bootstrap specifically\r\n- Add a new abstract method for creating engine-specific hoodie table\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit fd62a1413e74de686935672aec812aacd5c43a63)\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\n_Describe context and summary for this change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAt present, when Hudi cleaner uses the **KEEP_LATEST_FILE_VERSIONS** strategy to clean the Hudi table, hoodie will assume that once replaced a file group automatically becomes eligible for cleaning completely, which means all the replaced data files will be deleted as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nBut in this way, **the downstream unfinished query tasks will fail**. \r\n\r\nSo we need a mechanism to Control KEPP_LATEST_VERSIONS clean replaced files immediately or delete after a while\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen a write transaction writes uncommitted log files in a delta commit, e.g., due to Spark task retries, these log files stay in the file system after the successful delta commit for some time (unlike uncommitted base files, which are deleted based on the markers).  The delta commit metadata does not contain these log files, and the metadata table does not contain these entries either.  This is a valid case where the metadata-table-based file listing (providing committed data files) is different from the file system (providing committed data files + uncommited log files in this case).\r\n\r\nIn such a case, currently, the metadata table validator throws an exception for the mismatch, because the log blocks are checked based on the commit time, not validated against the commit metadata.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the logic of the metadata table validator to check whether the difference in the list of log files between metadata table and direct file system is due to committed log files, based on the commit metadata.\r\n\r\nThe PR is tested locally with such a case.  Before this PR, the metadata table validator throws an exception.  After this PR, the validator succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the robustness of the metadata table validator so that it does not fire false alarms for the valid case above.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

with other write clients, HoodieFlinkWriteClient invokes the dataset writing methods(#upsert or #insert) for each batch of new data set in the long running task. In current impl, a engine-specific hoodie table would be created before performing these actions, and before the table creation, some table bootstrapping operations are performed(such as table upgrade/downgrade, the metadata table bootstrap). These bootstrapping operations are guarded by a trasanction lock.\r\n\r\nIn Flink, these bootstrapping operations can be avoided because they are all performed only once on the coordinator.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Make BaseHoodieWriteClient#doInitTable non abstract, it now only performs the bootstrapping operations\r\n- Add a default impl BaseHoodieWriteClient#initMetadataTable for metadata table bootstrap specifically\r\n- Add a new abstract method for creating engine-specific hoodie table\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high
