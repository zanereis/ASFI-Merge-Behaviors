Previously,\r\ntroubleshooting required looking into logs across multiple systems,\r\nlike Hadoop mappers, Azkaban jobs and Gobblin service. Log messages\r\nrequired knowledge of how Gobblin works internally, and users frequently\r\nhad to involve Gobblin developers to understand them.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial commit for automatic Gobblin troubleshooter. The\r\ncurrent implementation will intercept logs from Mappers and Azkaban job\r\nand compile a list of issues based on them. This list will be filtered\r\nand prioritized. Then it will be displayed to the user in logs, and\r\nforwarded as an event for consumption by Gobblin service.\r\n\r\nFuture commits will add issue reporting in Gobblin service, as well\r\nas improve on issue filtering & refining.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check the docs on AutomaticTroubleshooter class,\r\nand review the design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BAYr-dHtdauX6Uf13VP3-IlHkyUQ5V64PjFIg9MtpaA/edit#\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1457","created_at":"2021-06-02T21:30:03Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T19:14:17Z","closed_at":"2021-07-01T19:14:17Z","merged_at":"2021-07-01T19:14:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5a85e35cff176d9bfa833c668a395785357e38c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3296/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3296/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3296/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/926953378db6be222db44c4f345175161e01a1fe","head":{"label":"aplex:error-logging-improvements","ref":"error-logging-improvements","sha":"926953378db6be222db44c4f345175161e01a1fe","user":{"login":"aplex","id":5938230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzgyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5938230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex","html_url":"https://github.com/aplex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":218642072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg2NDIwNzI=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"aplex/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aplex","id":5938230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzgyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5938230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex","html_url":"https://github.com/aplex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aplex/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n@jack-moseley @Will-Lo  please review\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1456\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblinServiceJobScheduler update logic first deletes the spec and then adds it back. I think it is unnecessary and also create an issue. During delete spec it calls Orchestrator remove code and that sends a delete call to spec executor, which is wrong, because flow spec is actually not intended to be deleted. On cluster side, it is forcing a state store deletion.\r\nThis PR will remove the delete part.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntrivial changes. tested locally\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1455\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe need to upper bound the config gobblin.kafka.minContainersForTopic so as not to exceed the number of partitions for the topic. When this config value exceeds the number of partitions, current behavior incorrectly estimates the work unit size in KafkaTopicGroupingWorkUnitPacker.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTrivial change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-31T10:07:46Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T17:01:29Z","closed_at":"2021-06-07T17:01:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e65459185a4f323bf7572c58c19e9dda7021ac66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/2a9eb55e9dda50364831ee5f67b69b4e5480fb3b","head":{"label":"dushyantk1509:GOBBLIN-1454","ref":"GOBBLIN-1454","sha":"2a9eb55e9dda50364831ee5f67b69b4e5480fb3b","user":{"login":"dushyantk1509","id":17546055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ2MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17546055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509","html_url":"https://github.com/dushyantk1509","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":372405325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzI0MDUzMjU=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"dushyantk1509/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dushyantk1509","id":17546055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ2MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17546055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509","html_url":"https://github.com/dushyantk1509","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dushyantk1509/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1452\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd meters to track the number of successful and failed flows run by gaas. There is one service level meter that tracks all flows, and a meter for each flowGroup.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested locally by printing value of meter over time\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-26T22:27:31Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T23:16:23Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T23:16:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a90b9c1de86bfa2a8796861d56ee1a3301c6da8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3290/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3290/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3290/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/bd9bc2db3348ec8ca19ce22fafd09d597b3b9ddf","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:flow-meters","ref":"flow-meters","sha":"bd9bc2db3348ec8ca19ce22fafd09d597b3b9ddf","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin-1446](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1446\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen using the two filters cron-schedule and property-filter during search for flow-configs we do not handle the case when the parameters have white spaces in them. To encode the spaces in the curli url we use %20 and need to update GaaS endpoints to be able to parse them, so I have added code to replace %20 with a white space. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nMy PR did not include unit testing as the filter functionality for flows could not be tested locally with FSSpecStore, however I verified that the encoding and decoding functionality with the debugger and deployment of open source GaaS via Docker. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-19T02:37:49Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T00:04:29Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T00:04:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32e0b9e7a881cd539aa40fd50e786c407571f8da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3285/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3285/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3285/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e8c6287e7438d703eebf6d2b2bedb50f42700807","head":{"label":"umustafi:decodeWhitespaceInCurli","ref":"decodeWhitespaceInCurli","sha":"e8c6287e7438d703eebf6d2b2bedb50f42700807","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1447\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWe have a dependency on Calcite, which has a dependency on pentaho. Due to either a moved repository or broken link it can no longer be resolved without adding a repository that points to the dependency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

is how workers on k8s could look like. I followed mapreduce's approach: \r\n- Have a PersistentVolume shared among workers (same as HDFS).\r\n- Copy jars and job.state there.\r\n- Have a docker container available to k8s. The container startup scripts takes an argument: classpath. Then launches the JVM with a simple java application which in turn launches the main(String[]) method of the class passed as argument. \r\n- The KuberJobLauncher, uses k8s api to create a pod with the container described above (and copies the jars/files to PersistentVolume's location beforehand)\r\n- Wait for the pod to exit.\r\n\r\nInstead of pod I should have used k8s's job. But for some reason pv and pvc do not work with jobs on my machine.\r\n\r\nk3d is used (https://github.com/rancher/k3d) to launch a cluster.\r\n\r\nAnd finally the MRJobLaucnher is (ab)used to launch the a k8s-based job.\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce the build and jobs:\r\n```bash\r\n# This acts as the HDFS path, everything is put here! hardcoded a lot of places\r\nsudo mkdir -p /a\r\n# Spawn a cluster and have the docker image ready\r\ncd gobblin-kubernetes-support/docker-java-runner/docker-local/\r\nmake k3d-reg k3d-cluster\r\nmake clean build push\r\ncd -\r\n# Create PV and PVC\r\ncd gobblin-kubernetes-support/k8s/\r\nmake apply\r\n# Launch gobblin\r\ncd -\r\n# build gobblin, last step (cp) fails, you can ignore that\r\nmake build\r\nmake run\r\nmake build\r\n```","created_at":"2021-05-16T13:02:55Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T07:35:39Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a1aced743a89d8147ae2a12fbace6d0c8891247","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3283/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3283/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3283/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4b96cb8a56c1c4169d02979d3989220cca238be0","head":{"label":"hkoosha:worker-on-k8s-poc","ref":"worker-on-k8s-poc","sha":"4b96cb8a56c1c4169d02979d3989220cca238be0","user":{"login":"hkoosha","id":63921250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIxMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63921250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha","html_url":"https://github.com/hkoosha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":367878475,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjc4Nzg0NzU=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"hkoosha/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hkoosha","id":63921250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIxMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63921250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha","html_url":"https://github.com/hkoosha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hkoosha/gobblin","description":"A

to initialize Gobblin service, we used a mixture\r\nof dependency injection, direct class creation and config-based\r\nclass creation. In this change, we unify the service initialization\r\nby moving towards using dependency injection(DI) with Guice everywhere.\r\n\r\nUsing DI will help with (1) unit testing; (2) overriding classes in the\r\nmiddle of the dependency with company-specific implementations, and\r\n(3) will improve code readability, as dependencies between classes\r\nbecome visible from the outside and explicit.\r\n\r\nWe also move away from name-based injection for classes. Name-based\r\ninjection is useful when code needs several different implementations\r\nof the same interface. In our use case, we had only one implementation\r\nfor each service that can be active. Name-based injection was used for\r\ncompany-specific overrides, but there is a better way to do it - with\r\nGuice module overrides.\r\n\r\nThere are still several improvements left to be done to have a full\r\nGuice migration, but we'll make them in separate commits to limit the\r\nPR size.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1444\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-14T17:18:19Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T17:31:17Z","closed_at":"2021-06-08T17:31:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad844a4697c2bd4d1afb455eeb983b47d66db6f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7c35355494af68a83d6231d063b441a327de57ed","head":{"label":"aplex:guice-migration","ref":"guice-migration","sha":"7c35355494af68a83d6231d063b441a327de57ed","user":{"login":"aplex","id":5938230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzgyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5938230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex","html_url":"https://github.com/aplex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":218642072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg2NDIwNzI=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"aplex/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aplex","id":5938230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzgyMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5938230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex","html_url":"https://github.com/aplex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aplex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aplex/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1440\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently Add/update/delete of flow specs and cancellation of a job execution happen via putting/deleting these specs in job catalog. Listeners of Spec Catalog take appropriate actions. While for add/update/delete this makes sense to modify job catalog, it makes little sense for job execution cancellation request to update job catalog in order to trigger the cancellation because job and execution are two different entities. \r\nThis PR will move cancel-job-triggering logic from job catalog listeners to kafkajob monitor. This will also clean a lot of code  which exists due to the need to pass cancellation request from job monitor to job catalog to spec consumer to jobConfigurationManager to jobScheduler\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nmanually tested\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n@aplex @arjun4084346  @jack-moseley  @umustafi  Please take a look\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1439\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFlowSpecs that fail to compile due to unexpected exceptions (e.g. NullPointerException) can cause the Job Scheduler to silently fail adding jobs.\r\nTo fix the error we should first reject users from adding flowConfigs that cause compilation errors. Also, if encountering a flow that fails to compile, log it and continue scheduling the rest of the flows instead of silently failing with unscheduled jobs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit tests mocking listener compilation errors\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1438\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR changes failed dags to only be loaded if resume is called (and only the dag that was resumed is loaded) to avoid keeping all failed dags in memory at all times, since this can cause memory issues.\r\n\r\nChanges for this:\r\n- In `DagManager`, keep a list of failed dagIds instead of a map of all failed dags. This list is still needed to know which dags to clean up, and also allows us to avoid calling the dag store for dags that aren't there.\r\n- Add an API in `DagStateStore` to load only one dag, because previously the only option was to load all dags at once, which would still cause memory issues.\r\n- Add an API  in `DagStateStore` to get all dag IDs\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated unit tests and tested resuming locally\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1434\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nBy default, maxWaitMills to get a hive client in HiveMetastoreClientPool is set to be -1L, and in this case, the get call will wait for the client object forever if there is no available one. This ticket is to make maxWaitMills configurable, so that after maxWaitMills, it will throw timeout exception. But still, the default value will be -1L.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-21T21:22:04Z","updated_at":"2021-04-26T23:46:30Z","closed_at":"2021-04-26T23:46:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6a6c83666c86952ae0849dfc648d90b6b611c6d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3267/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3267/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3267/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7758d99d8dd09a3c4ea88cc898f0897dc10dc921","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1434","ref":"GOBBLIN-1434","sha":"7758d99d8dd09a3c4ea88cc898f0897dc10dc921","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n-  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1431\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe test in the `TestSingleTask` has been failing when being executed on CI. It is also reproducible by running: \r\n```./gradlew :gobblin-cluster:test --tests org.apache.gobblin.cluster.TestSingleTask``` \r\n\r\nThe real problem is more complicated and the proper fix will be out of the scope for now. The issue can be described in the following: \r\n- Without overriding `shutdown` method in the `dummyExtrator`, it throws exception when being called. Note that this code path is only executed when `shutdownRequested` is set (only be set when a `Task` is being cancelled), as it wrote in `Task.java#510`, not through the regular shutdown of extractor. \r\n- Before the change of GOBBLIN-1416 it was not surfacing up because the sync-barrier was placed in the wrong place. Will expand it into more details later. In short, from the log, it seems the cancel call and run call was running sequentially. (See the log paragraph I in the bottom)\r\n- After GOBBLIN-1416 this test failed, reasoning being the `org.apache.gobblin.runtime.GobblinMultiTaskAttempt#run #167` is returning as a result of cancel, so that the real cancel code-path was being executed so that the `shutdown` method in the `dummyExtractor` is called. However the default implementation in the `Extractor` interface throws an error and it eventually blow up the task. A supporting evidence for this process is the status of fork was printed as \"RUNNING\" from the failing tests, which means the return from `org.apache.gobblin.runtime.GobblinMultiTaskAttempt#run #167` doesn't handle the state of fork within the cancelled task. \r\n\r\nThe follow up of this PR should address: \r\n- The sync-barrier, `org.apache.gobblin.cluster.SingleTask#_taskAttemptBuilt` should already be sync between the creation of `List<Task>` in the taskAttempt (instead of the creation of `taskAttempt` and cancel call). GOBBLIN-1416 was trying to solve this problem in a different way. I believe it could be unified.\r\n- The handling of fork state when a task is being shutdown is probably something that should be fixed also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParagraph I \r\n```2021-04-19 16:23:09 PDT INFO  [pool-32-thread-1] org.apache.gobblin.cluster.SingleTask 225 - Task cancelled: Shutdown starting for tasks with jobId: testJob\r\n    2021-04-19 16:23:09 PDT INFO  [pool-32-thread-1] org.apache.gobblin.runtime.GobblinMultiTaskAttempt 255 - Shutting down tasks\r\n    2021-04-19 16:23:09 PDT INFO  [pool-32-thread-1] org.apache.gobblin.cluster.SingleTask 227 - Task cancelled: Shutdown complete for tasks with jobId: testJob\r\n    2021-04-19 16:23:09 PDT INFO  [pool-32-thread-2] org.apache.gobblin.runtime.GobblinMultiTaskAttempt$2 510 - Task creation attempt 1\r\n    2021-04-19 16:23:09 PDT WARN  [pool-32-thread-2] org.apache.gobblin.metrics.MetricContext$Builder 714 - MetricContext with specified name already exists, appending UUID to the given name: 2f98aa98-1c81-4770-85e9-7731ee3afff1\r\n    2021-04-19 16:23:09 PDT INFO  [pool-32-thread-2] org.apache.gobblin.runtime.TaskExecutor 259 - Submitting task randomTask\r\n    2021-04-19 16:23:09 PDT WARN  [TaskExecutor-0] org.apache.gobblin.runtime.Task 362 - Synchronous task execution model is deprecated.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1427\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhen files on target directory do not exist on viewfs, MountPointNotFoundException is raised instead of FileNotFoundException. This causes the code to error out when it should be returning an empty list of files at the target location.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-16T00:49:08Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T23:47:41Z","closed_at":"2021-04-23T16:41:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f882ba6ee00772ad354e0b54288a2d0e987a7e09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3263/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3263/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3263/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7d568076921319adf81b8478aa3c5e47dedc0b25","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:use-ioexception-file-distcp","ref":"use-ioexception-file-distcp","sha":"7d568076921319adf81b8478aa3c5e47dedc0b25","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1424\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGithub CI is flaky due to the issue described here https://github.community/t/github-action-and-oserror-errno-99-cannot-assign-requested-address/173973. This fix adds a step to add hosts for reverse lookup to not fail, as well as some timeout improvements for flakiness.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-14T18:02:58Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:38:04Z","closed_at":"2021-04-15T03:07:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d267748ce9e697a30595db6938dcadbef4091a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3260/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3260/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3260/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/e5c8949622d6ba02fcefcb7ce9d8000b1cf3d66e","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:pipeline-improvements-flaky","ref":"pipeline-improvements-flaky","sha":"e5c8949622d6ba02fcefcb7ce9d8000b1cf3d66e","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1422\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nBased on Bintray's sunset https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/ publishing to bintray can no longer be done by May 1st. We will need to publish jars to an alternative source, such as JFrog's Artifactory.\r\nThis PR changes the publishing location to artifactory instead of bintray.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-13T19:25:13Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T23:47:39Z","closed_at":"2021-04-19T16:29:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5e2213c6534b87c489c1b120e977fd0d0276c6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3258/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3258/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3258/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4b9885e1eb44dbb91963a6cfc0b72833efcaa386","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:migrate-to-artifactory","ref":"migrate-to-artifactory","sha":"4b9885e1eb44dbb91963a6cfc0b72833efcaa386","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1420\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nStreamModelTaskRunner submits a thread that consumes and processes records in the streaming mode. Currently, this thread can die silently in case of an uncaught exception (e.g. OOMEs), leaving no trace of the exception. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe proposed change only sets the UncaughtExceptionHandler for the thread created by StreamModelTaskRunner. Existing unit tests should cover the changes proposed in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-08T23:38:31Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T19:38:11Z","closed_at":"2021-04-15T19:38:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d2341b95e1eba8872bb4007ddbcaf48c746648fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3256/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3256/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3256/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a705757edeed02b8935623a62ab243ffc321895e","head":{"label":"sv2000:logUncaughtExceptions","ref":"logUncaughtExceptions","sha":"a705757edeed02b8935623a62ab243ffc321895e","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1419\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nNo compaction publish file and emit GMCE are happening separately. If file rename succeed but emit GMCE fails, we will end up with not emit GMCE for the compaction. So need  a strategy to do error handling for compaction that when emit GMCE fails, next job will treat the previous compaction as fail and re-compact the data.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-02T22:28:47Z","updated_at":"2021-04-23T18:13:53Z","closed_at":"2021-04-23T18:13:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cb0ed25394b59a8ee5b700d894c1d06fcccefaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3255/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3255/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3255/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/2bc108690eefba1f5c9a8219ddfbf1ae531c15cf","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1419","ref":"GOBBLIN-1419","sha":"2bc108690eefba1f5c9a8219ddfbf1ae531c15cf","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

a job\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1418\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nSetting the default java Authenticator allows you to run a job and force all proxy/http calls to go through this Authenticator. This is useful for example for a job where going through a proxy (which requires user/password) is desired, but using APIs with underlying http clients that don't support providing user/password. (See [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1626549/authenticated-http-proxy-with-java/43263674) discussion about this).  This PR makes this possible by:\r\n\r\n- Adding a class extending Authenticator which provides a user/password from job properties (with decryption)\r\n- Adding an optional key that will set the default Authenticator when the job launches (in AbstractJobLauncher)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSuccessfully ran a job that was not working by providing user/password directly in jvm args\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-29T22:49:03Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T19:40:45Z","closed_at":"2021-04-15T19:40:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60cf9a2647eb4db5edfc5a40c7ec6bee76753294","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3254/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3254/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3254/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d7de19b3f55bc8c388ec0c2a6bf6541c39ffe6b2","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:default-authenticator","ref":"default-authenticator","sha":"d7de19b3f55bc8c388ec0c2a6bf6541c39ffe6b2","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1417\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrent behavior enforces the default row batch size of 1024. To prevent OOMs during writes, this config may need to be overridden.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested with a MR job and ensuring the config is overridden.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-29T17:21:06Z","updated_at":"2025-01-11T21:35:32Z","closed_at":"2021-05-07T01:00:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3098133fa582af05335b323a23fe0eaf8e2b93a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3253/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3253/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3253/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/bf4bd3fa71cf2c211548761ea34305db65cfde4e","head":{"label":"sv2000:orcMRRowBatchSize","ref":"orcMRRowBatchSize","sha":"bf4bd3fa71cf2c211548761ea34305db65cfde4e","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1413] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1413\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nEmit GMCE(Gobblin Metadata Change Event) as long as watermark moved on streaming pipeline. \r\n\r\nCurrently the GMCE won't be triggered within streaming pipeline if no new file being generated. This causes problem if watermarks moved, while no file being generated(for example, data been filtered out by quality checker), GMCE will be missed.\r\n\r\nChange GMCE publisher to produce GMCE when no file generated. Change IcebergMetadataWriter to correctly update watermark. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-24T05:49:43Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T21:12:22Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T21:12:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5bc0cbb4e831312a689379f09cbcf50e356d9fff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3252/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3252/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3252/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/50519b0c762f3901f8fb2e54370fe26279cad487","head":{"label":"hanghangliu:GOBBLIN-1413-Emit-GMCE-as-long-as-watermark-moved","ref":"GOBBLIN-1413-Emit-GMCE-as-long-as-watermark-moved","sha":"50519b0c762f3901f8fb2e54370fe26279cad487","user":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":264983661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjQ5ODM2NjE=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"hanghangliu/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1415\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe used to introduce the timeout for partitionedWriter, and the default value is set to be 480. It broke distcp job which is trying to copy large file. So we want to make the default value to be Long.MAX_VALUE to make it backward compatible.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-19T20:56:27Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T18:04:35Z","closed_at":"2021-03-22T18:04:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02d2f25e84b104f1fe927706674604b5a91ffef0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0dab60c8ac14679d2511e7e0bbc0480df9b7b94f","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1415-new","ref":"GOBBLIN-1415-new","sha":"0dab60c8ac14679d2511e7e0bbc0480df9b7b94f","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Description\r\nWhen consuming from Kafka, we need the kafka timestamp.  We weren't sure if there was another way to expose this, but figured it's a general enough need that it should be implemented.  And it didn't affect performance as far as we could see.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- I added a basic test, but I'm really not sure about it, I couldn't replicate the testing environment.  Some advice on that would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-11T18:33:11Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T18:43:52Z","closed_at":"2021-03-12T18:43:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8985362f08d0d085fc161892051a5fdd4a13cc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3243/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3243/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3243/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7690de8dbaaf2a59e274d9df143e7715f42c6f23","head":{"label":"milimetric:master","ref":"master","sha":"7690de8dbaaf2a59e274d9df143e7715f42c6f23","user":{"login":"milimetric","id":1038928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzg5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1038928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric","html_url":"https://github.com/milimetric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":327354020,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjczNTQwMjA=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"milimetric/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"milimetric","id":1038928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzg5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1038928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric","html_url":"https://github.com/milimetric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milimetric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/milimetric/incubator-gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1402\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nMake it possible to update the owner/requester list in a FlowConfig in some circumstances, and also refactoring/fixing some other related issues.\r\n\r\n- In `FlowConfigResourceLocalHandler`, don't overwrite the previous requester list property (to allow it to be updated if it was specified by a user)\r\n- Move whitelisted requester checking to an API in `RequesterService` to allow it to be used by handlers\r\n- Add some checks to deprecated \"flowconfigs\" endpoint, since it was possible to set owning group to a group you were not part of through that endpoint\r\n- Add checks as well to \"flowconfigsV2\" endpoint to avoid a similar way of updating the owning group, and to include the logic for when requester list is allowed to be updated\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated unit tests and tested locally\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1398\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nGOBBLIN-1308 takes care of ability to connect to remote and secure hive metastore, but it still requires the management of hive-site to be provided to be container local file. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to multiple hive clusters this manual management approach would not work, and requires special feature of providing system specific hive-site.xml without namespace collision.\r\n\r\nThis ticket aims to do following things\r\n1) define a way to provide remote system configuration ( keep giving flat config is more cumbersome )\r\n2) based on system config and feature flag, copy config files to container local path automatically.\r\n3) when creating metastoreClient, pick up the right config for the requested system ( identified by the metastore URI )\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Needs to add unit test once reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1394\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCallbackDispatcher error logs cast the error to a string, removing the stacktrace. This makes it difficult to debug the issue when an exception is thrown.\r\nPR uses the logging library's Throwable argument to print the exception stacktrace.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

after task completes\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1384\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nPer the current behavior, the task is marked as completed as soon as task cancellation is invoked, which interrupts the task, and immediately decrements a latch counting the number of running tasks. This implies that GobblinMultiTaskAttempt which monitors this countdown latch, can invoke task commit before the task has completed. This can lead to incorrect behavior in batch mode and potential resource leak in the streaming mode where commit failures potentially leaves some resources open.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit tests in TaskTest.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1374\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrent implementation writes the job specs to a fixed staging location before the specs get renamed to a final publish location. To avoid concurrent producers writing to the same file, we generate a unique staging location. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

This significantly reduces its speed of consumption.\r\nThis PR will make the polling a continuous task to speed consumption up\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit tests already exist\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1359\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAfter the first change https://github.com/apache/incubator-gobblin/pull/3200, we still see the job hang if onNext throw error after a long processing time (i.e. 5 mins). \r\nAnd after investigating, we see the ConnectableFlowable.connect() which is supposed to return immediately does not return even the flow is finished and canceled. And the root cause is that in this case where consumer is super slow, extractor is sleeping on lastFlushAckable.waitForAck(), but the control message will never be processed, so the extractor just hang there.\r\nSo the solution will be 1. Make the call of connect in another thread, and let the sequence code get executed which is to periodically check whether the job finished. This is to make job respect fork timeout\r\n2. In flow.doFinal(), call the shutdown again to make sure shutdown can be processed even extractor is sleep in readRecord. And in shutdown process, manually nack the Ackable to wake up the thread.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nRun end to end test on Azkaban: \r\n1. For normal case, record get processed and write out correctly, also verify that the timeout for fork can take effect\r\n2. For bad case where write is slow, we simulate the situation and make sure the exception thrown by writer can be catch and fail the job. Also I use jstack to make sure we do not have any thread hanging in this case (after the task restart)\r\n3. For bad case where writer throw exception right away, make sure the exception will fail the task and cause task to retry\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1372\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR mainly is for refactoring the method `GobblinClusterUtils#setSystemProperties`. The problem was: There are some unnecessary details being exposed: `JAVA_TMP_DIR_KEY` and resolution of `YARN_CACHE` are all very specific to Gobblin-on-YARN applications. These things shouldn't be set through if-branch but through configurations only. \r\n\r\nAfter refactoring: \r\nThere's no specific key/value matching within `setSystemProperties` method, and we don't lose the capability for limiting resolution of `YARN_CACHE` only for a specific set of configuration with being backward-compatible. \r\n\r\nAlso, the refactor also let the program to set additional configuration with value specified as `YARN_CACHE` using the following pairs: \r\n```\r\ngobblin.cluster.systemPropertiesList.YARN_CACHE=grape.root\r\ngobblin.cluster.sysProps.grape.root=YARN_CACHE\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf trying to achieve the same purpose as `-Dgrape.root=YARN_CACHE`\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, it adds a bunch of entries in the .gitignore file. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nUnit tested with resolution cases. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1370\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nFlow resume was previously represented as a partial update, which makes it a pretty confusing API. But restli actually supports an API for actions, which is a much simpler and more obvious way to represent a triggered action like resuming a flow.\r\n\r\nWith this method, the url to request resuming a flow looks like `https://localhost:6956/gobblinservice/flowexecutions/(flowGroup:testGroup1,flowName:testFlow1,flowExecutionId:1611270235422)?action=resume`\r\n\r\nAlso fixed a bug that all jobs were being set to `PENDING_RESUME` instead of only the failed/cancelled ones in `DagManager`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested locally\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1361\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe have seen many cases that when we need to load `ivysettings.xml` from classpath, there's already one provided by pending applications (e.g. Hive has one of its jar containing the `ivysettings.xml`), it is quite tricky to avoid conflicts with existing settings file. Instead we added a new file name to be loaded in the `DownloadUtils` to avoid conflicting names with guarantee of backward-compatibility. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1225\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nMany HTTP data sources, including OData and GraphQL based data sources, use a set of common HTTP request methods,\r\nbut their parameters can vary significantly case by case. The Gobblin ecosystem has multiple connectors that were\r\nbuilt to suite those needs, for example, the Salesforce connector, the Google Search Console connector, etc.\r\n\r\nMultistage connector framework is a paradigm that makes connectors more generic and more reusable. We have used this framework to address the huge variety challenge in data integration with external data sources. \r\n\r\nHTTP data sources are the top beneficiary of this framework, including Rest API, OData, and SOAP based data sources. S3 and GCS (Google Cloud Storage) data sources can also benefit from it in small data volumes that are less than 10TB, without using SDK. \r\n\r\nWe have also verified the HTTP Multistage connector can greatly simplify data ingestion from Salesforce.com. However, this PR doesn't included the necessary component, CSV Extractor, yet. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes following functionalities:\r\n\t- This PR contains a separate multistage module that works with HTTP data sources\r\n\t- It supports HTTP GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations\r\n\t- It supports nested JSON format\r\n\t- It supports Rest API calls and its derived OData service\r\n\t- It supports following ways of pagination\r\n\t\t○ By offset and page size\r\n\t\t○ By page number\r\n\t\t○ By a total record count\r\n\t\t○ By signal of an empty response\r\n\t\t○ By next page URL\r\n\t\t○ By a cursor or next page locator\r\n\t- It supports session state control as a mechanism of pagination or asynchronous requests\r\n\t- It supports pulling files from GCS or S3 via HTTP requests\r\n\t- It supports field project, including nested field projection, based on a given schema\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAll 113 unit tests were successful.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50   ##characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.
