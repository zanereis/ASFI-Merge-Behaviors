changes here cause source offset readers to forcefully close when tasks fail to shut down within the graceful shutdown timeout period. When this happens, all pending and future offset read requests will throw an exception.\r\n\r\nThis is in line with the [API for the OffsetStorageReader class](https://kafka.apache.org/23/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/OffsetStorageReader.html#offsets-java.util.Collection-), which states that \"The only case when an exception will be thrown is if the entire request failed, e.g. because the underlying storage was unavailable.\". If a task is blocked on reading offsets from Kafka to the point where it has failed to shut down within the graceful shutdown timeout period, it's safe to say that the offset read request has failed and as a result, throw an exception.\r\n\r\nInitially, I considered just returning null values from the offset reader once closed; however, this may cause source tasks to mutate some external state as if there were no offset for the requested source partitions and may negatively impact other tasks that have since been started by this connector. An exception is safer, and with the distinction between throwing one when a task has exceeded its graceful shutdown period vs. just being scheduled to stop, should not damage the functionality of

PR adds logic to remove sensors for a particular node connection when node disconnects.\r\n\r\nIn order to be more familiar with `JMXReporter`, `Metrics` and `Sensor`s functionality I did some tests refactoring to make them more communicative (at least from my point of view)\r\n\r\nWhen a connection is established a KafkaMBean is registered, and each metric is added as MBean attribute. MBean is removed only when all metrics are.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

changes here are meant to find a healthy compromise between the pre- and post-KIP-458 functionality of Connect workers when configuring admin clients for use with DLQs. Before KIP-458, admin clients were configured using the top-level worker configs; after KIP-458, they are configured using worker configs with a prefix of `admin.` and then optionally overridden by connector configs with a prefix of `admin.override.`. The behavior proposed here is to use, in ascending order of precedence, the top-level worker configs, worker configs prefixed with `admin.`, and connector configs prefixed with `admin.override.`; essentially, use the pre-KIP-458 behavior by default but allow it to be overridden by the post-KIP-458 behavior.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-15T23:39:48Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T05:55:11Z","closed_at":"2019-11-14T08:39:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a02db38b259bfd89067373df50a0a65059f75bff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ae232d262215c0c80aea45bbe5ffed4f9d05fb88","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-9046","ref":"kafka-9046","sha":"ae232d262215c0c80aea45bbe5ffed4f9d05fb88","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

Background\r\n\r\nThe KafkaConsumer Fetcher can sometimes get into an invalid state where it believes that there are ongoing fetch requests, but in fact there are none.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the Consumer continuing to long poll as if there are no messages available from the broker, and continuing to heartbeat and stay a part of the consumer group, but never receiving any new information from the Broker about the state of the partition or any new messages.\r\n\r\nThis may be caused by the heartbeat thread concurrently handling a disconnection event just after the fetcher thread submits a request which would cause the Fetcher to enter an invalid state where it believes it has ongoing requests to the disconnected node but in fact it does not. This is due to a thread safety issue in the Fetcher where it was possible for the ordering of the modifications to the `nodesWithPendingFetchRequests` to be incorrect - the Fetcher was adding it after the listener had already been invoked, which would mean that pending node never gets removed again.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses that thread safety issue by ensuring that the pending node is added to the `nodesWithPendingFetchRequests` before the listener is added to the future, ensuring the finally block is called after the node is added. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nI added a unit test which simulates the concurrent disconnect. The test validates that after the disconnections, the Fetcher is still able to send a request. In the case where we hit the threading issue, `sendFetches` will return 0 because it still thinks there are pending requests even though there are not. I modified the `MockClient` to add a new `wakeupHook` that gets invoked (if present) every time `client.wakeup` is called. This allows us to simulate another thread's actions during the `ConsumerNetworkClient#send`. Happy to find other ways of simulating the threading problems.\r\n\r\nThanks to @thomaslee for collaborating on the solution for this.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

four flavors of the repartition/optimization tests have been reported as flaky and failed in one place or

pretty similar so it makes sense to knock them all out at once. This PR does three things:\r\n1. Switch to in-memory stores wherever possible\r\n2. Name all operators and update the Topology accordingly (not really a flaky test fix, but had to update the topology names anyway because of the IM stores so figured might as well)\r\n3. Port to TopologyTestDriver -- this is the \"real\" fix, should make a big difference as these repartition tests required multiple roundtrips with the Kafka cluster (while using only the default timeout)\r\n\r\n(If we want to backport this I can open another PR without the naming, and if we want to go all the way back to pre-TopologyTestDriver versions I think it makes sense to just double the timeout)","created_at":"2019-10-09T02:36:18Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T22:38:20Z","closed_at":"2019-10-10T23:23:18Z","merged_at":"2019-10-10T23:23:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc6525a74631d44d093ef75ecedb47f422004f13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7472/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7472/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7472/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/47c574dd6bfa44f7ed3feed89b477a8abe330987","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:flaky-test-RWMOIT-sSCRO","ref":"flaky-test-RWMOIT-sSCRO","sha":"47c574dd6bfa44f7ed3feed89b477a8abe330987","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

work-in-progress collection of changes to implement KIP-455 for the ReassignPartitionsCommand.\r\n\r\nThese changes are intended to remove the dependence of the ReassignPartitionsCommand on the ZK client and utilize the new AdminClient interfaces for doing partition reassignments. Eventually the command will support incremental changes to ongoing reassignments, including cancellation.\r\n\r\nThis is being done in the background and will be updated irregularly (hence the WIP designation).\r\n\r\nThe changes are significant, but the commits are ordered to be relatively small and easy to understand and build on each other; it is strongly recommended that the review be done a commit at a time rather than all at once.\r\n\r\nThe first several commits are \"infrastructure\" work that gets things ready. Then a service abstraction which can be used with either ZK or Admin clients is provided and implemented, so that the command can (eventually) run entirely with just the Admin client. Unit tests are provided for the Service client (XXX: not all tests are implemented yet but those that exist should be fine.)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-09T01:37:53Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T21:06:10Z","closed_at":"2020-05-12T21:06:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb85052bb8e31adf8f53eaad35bec1c81eea187e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e9880398ff69938150dd73108dbf9c7399b13353","head":{"label":"steverod:steverod.kafka-8820-wip","ref":"steverod.kafka-8820-wip","sha":"e9880398ff69938150dd73108dbf9c7399b13353","user":{"login":"steverod","id":42848865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQ4ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42848865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod","html_url":"https://github.com/steverod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203641171,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDM2NDExNzE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"steverod/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steverod","id":42848865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODQ4ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42848865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod","html_url":"https://github.com/steverod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steverod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steverod/kafka","description":"Mirror

tried to use `commitRequested` to synchronize the test progress, however, this mechanism seems to be broken. Note that `context.commit();` is a request that KS should commit asap -- however, after `context.commit()` returned only an internal flag is set and the commit is not executed yet.\r\n\r\nHence, after the counter is increased to 2, there is no guarantee what happens next: either we commit, or we might actually `poll()` for new data and if `writeInputData(uncommittedDataBeforeFailure);` executed before KS `poll()` again, we might process more than 10 records per partition before we actually commit, and hence the test fails.\r\n\r\nA better way seems to be, to read the committed output data before writing new data to make sure the new data is not part of the first transactions and stays uncommitted before we inject the error.\r\n\r\nCall for review @guozhangwang @ableegoldman @abbccdda

PR contains the fix of race condition bug between \"consumer thread\" and \"consumer coordinator heartbeat thread\". It reproduces in many production environments.\r\n\r\nCondition for reproducing:\r\n\r\n1. Consumer thread initiates rejoin to the group because of commit timeout. Call of `AbstractCoordinator#joinGroupIfNeeded` which leads to `sendJoinGroupRequest`.\r\n2. `JoinGroupResponseHandler` writes to the `AbstractCoordinator.this.generation` new generation data and leaves the` synchronized` section.\r\n3. Heartbeat thread executes `mabeLeaveGroup` and clears generation data via `resetGenerationOnLeaveGroup`.\r\n4. Consumer thread executes `onJoinComplete(generation.generationId, generation.memberId, generation.protocol, memberAssignment);` with the cleared generation data. This leads to the corresponding exception.\r\n\r\nThe race fixed with the condition in `maybeLeaveGroup`: if we have ongoing rejoin process in consumer thread there is no reason to reset generation data and send `LeaveGroupRequest` in heartbeat thread.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains unfair \"reproducer\".\r\nIt implemented with the `CountDownLatch` that imitates described race in `AbstractCoordinator`

scalac optimizer is able to inline methods to avoid lambda allocations, eliminating\r\nthe runtime cost of higher order functions in many cases. The compilation parameters\r\nwe are using here were introduced in 2.12.x, so we don't enable them for Scala 2.11.\r\nAlso, we enable a more aggressive inlining policy for the `core` project since it's\r\nnot meant to be used as a library.\r\n\r\nSee https://www.lightbend.com/blog/scala-inliner-optimizer for more information about\r\nthe optimizer.\r\n\r\nI verified that the lambda allocation in the code below (from LogCleaner.scala) went away\r\nafter this change with Scala 2.12 and 2.13.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nprivate def consumeAbortedTxnsUpTo(offset: Long): Unit = {\r\n  while (abortedTransactions.headOption.exists(_.firstOffset <= offset)) {\r\n    val abortedTxn = abortedTransactions.dequeue()\r\n    ongoingAbortedTxns.getOrElseUpdate(abortedTxn.producerId, new AbortedTransactionMetadata(abortedTxn))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe relevant part of the bytecode when compiled with Scala 2.13 looks like:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nprivate void consumeAbortedTxnsUpTo(long);\r\n    Code:\r\n       0: aload_0\r\n       1: invokespecial #54                 // Method abortedTransactions:()Lscala/collection/mutable/PriorityQueue;\r\n       4:

increased inlining causes some spurious spotBugs warnings, I added a few suppressions\r\nand fixed one warning by avoiding unnecessary boxing.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit
