reference a dagbag object created in other test modules.  If you run them independently they may fail.  E.g. task instance retry test references a dagbag object created in scheduler job test.  \r\n\r\nThis PR copies into each module the few lines of code it takes to make the tests run correctly, independently of other modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

This results in some flaky test failures if in task instance tests for example where the same TI is executed multiple times (the mutated `self.env` is re-rendered, so it looks at all `.sh` and `.bash` in your os env and tries to render them as templates. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:  small change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4797\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - Fix zombie detection and killing by removing the condition that returned zombie task instances only once within 10 seconds. The method is called only once per second anyway because the loop sleeps if it's faster than one second. The executed query uses indexes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n  - Adapted existing test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-15T16:55:17Z","updated_at":"2019-06-30T11:23:54Z","closed_at":"2019-06-30T11:23:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8bea0bb8279890a8de088ea4303ffa421e0633f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5420/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5420/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5420/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/93de2ce7c337e6aad240a7a043a6bd3fc86f2bc2","head":{"label":"seelmann:AIRFLOW-4797-fix-zombie-detection","ref":"AIRFLOW-4797-fix-zombie-detection","sha":"93de2ce7c337e6aad240a7a043a6bd3fc86f2bc2","user":{"login":"seelmann","id":86629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann","html_url":"https://github.com/seelmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seelmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"979f4524e0ffcd28d33e83605cdf59ce777d0c13","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4792\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdded Sentry into the contrib folder of Airflow. This hook allows easy connection to the Sentry SDK for specific DAGs.\r\n\r\n![](https://uc8353485516b6996dfc8ec4cae1.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/p/thumb/AAfNnez6fsZytBCNXvw7UphIyCT2KtNdewrvlOjmc_900Fj-09XXi_zpudNiFfMe7HAmtWQopRFhczeqCD9d4zE1KcSYRkslor_ERDLPQOrK19vm8bFtY0tGPwYzjbtJe-U4a-2wesfpYSpRepzRg8w_sXmR8ThXbkHMD22mNAEBpPxUlxEk4QSPBs9vQoLGQw6bmKTs8DzXJJkItGY1rBdAesi957f8C4iG3qPiaSfl-5eLrTMkgsf4QTYDGxbwWK4AHOmpuuXiWfdxX49hc-iwx3jgBSUMqbWhhsrlYvy2pM7a610xlOyV1DxvZSObQi4Ywi224wEY_Wc9NqNKqH_pdoYUCvzAIlKNj-bOopZYRM_y5HZpTUqB-A_Gqx0lndXgv1ozJYYYEOAA3d1ezZoXH3PuciDRMCNW_7YUmWBGbgmQaCLg673VTqrEhyz7uaM-kSul2e_vqK2kHni7WPCa/p.png?fv_content=true&size_mode=5)\r\n\r\nDifferences between #5416 and #5407:\r\n#5416:  PR focuses on adding Sentry functionality to specific DAGs. This is achieved by adding a sentry hook to the contrib folder. Users can then simply call the hook with their `SENTRY_DSN` for each DAG.\r\n#5407: PR focuses on adding Sentry to the Airflow ecosystem. Its aim is to handle all errors within airflow (Scheduler, worker, DAGs, tasks).  (This is the continuation of #5382, which I closed by accident.)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests to `sentry_hook.py`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-13T21:12:50Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T16:51:35Z","closed_at":"2019-09-03T16:51:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31aba375d3aa9b113389d69b136d3f032081abe8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdded name under Who uses Apache Airflow for tracking purpose.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4741\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR is to add Sentry SDK functionality to Airflow. The functionality includes adding tags per task event and breadcrumbs of previous tasks that ran on the DAG. \r\n\r\nDifferences between #5416 and #5407:\r\n#5416:  PR focuses on adding Sentry functionality to specific DAGs. This is achieved by adding a sentry hook to the contrib folder. Users can then simply call the hook with their `SENTRY_DSN` for each DAG.\r\n#5407: PR focuses on adding Sentry to the Airflow ecosystem. Its aim is to handle all errors within airflow (Scheduler, worker, DAGs, tasks).  (This is the continuation of #5382, which I closed by accident.)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds unit tests for `sentry.py`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation under `error.rst`.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-11T23:31:03Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T17:06:18Z","closed_at":"2019-09-24T09:22:02Z","merged_at":"2019-09-24T09:22:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc3bfe470c2d6ad9cda801635e3514088d38aed5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5407/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5407/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5407/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fe0af33e109c8a0fe4f3090f47003bcfe8d14997","head":{"label":"tiopi:add_sentry","ref":"add_sentry","sha":"fe0af33e109c8a0fe4f3090f47003bcfe8d14997","user":{"login":"tiopi","id":13202929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjAyOTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13202929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi","html_url":"https://github.com/tiopi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190629953,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA2Mjk5NTM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"tiopi/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tiopi","id":13202929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjAyOTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13202929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi","html_url":"https://github.com/tiopi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tiopi/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4760\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n[AIRFLOW-2900](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3749) introduced a change that broke Airflow whenever it tries to reprocess a packaged DAG. Since that change, the `fileloc` column in the database for packaged DAGs isn't an actual filepath. It looks something like: `/usr/local/airflow/dags/package.zip/my_dag.py` -- **notice that the path to the DAG inside the zip is appended to the zip file's path**. Then, when the `DagBag#process_file` method tries to load that filepath, it bails because that filepath is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that behavior by updating the `DagBag#get_dag` method such that when it fetches the DAG from the database and proceeds to reprocess the file, instead of using the `orm_dag.fileloc` property directly, we reuse the `correct_maybe_zipped` helper function to ensure that the passed value is an actual filepath.\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n![2019-06-07-ghosting-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/357481/59211651-546bc580-8b7e-11e9-9a6a-fa7ee56e65de.gif)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n![2019-06-07-ghosting-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/357481/59211737-9f85d880-8b7e-11e9-877a-98c1f729d186.gif)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n  - add a sanity check test to ensure that the `fileloc` property does not change for packaged DAGs\r\n  - add a test to verify that packaged DAGs can be refreshed\r\n  - add a test that plain `.py` DAGs can also be refreshed (seems silly to have test coverage for only packaged DAGs 😄)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4759\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSetting a dagrun to success or failure calls `set_state` for each task in the dag, running multiple database queries for each one. We can reduce the number of queries, and improve performance for the associated endpoints, by setting the states of all relevant tasks in the same query.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nResolves [AIRFLOW-4756](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4756).\r\n\r\nPreviously, if you have a long-running dag run, and a task fails, and you clear it, then until the cleared task starts running again, viewing gantt chart will throw a json encode error.\r\n\r\nIt appears this is because current gantt view logic uses ti.start_date to select tis for inclusion in gantt chart.  And when you clear a TI, it only nulls out the state -- not the start_date -- so these cleared TIs would still be added to `tis` even though they have been cleared and thus have no state. And for whatever reason, json conversion does not like None type for state. \r\n\r\nThis solution just adds a check to ensure state is not None for TI inclusion in gantt.\r\n\r\nRelevant error bit is here:\r\n```  File \"/Users/dstandish/.virtualenvs/scratch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/www/templates/airflow/gantt.html\", line 58, in block \"tail\"\r\n    data = {{ data |tojson|safe }};\r\n  File \"/Users/dstandish/.virtualenvs/scratch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/flask/json/__init__.py\", line 327, in tojson_filter\r\n    return Markup(htmlsafe_dumps(obj, **kwargs))\r\n  File \"/Users/dstandish/.virtualenvs/scratch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/flask/json/__init__.py\", line 242, in htmlsafe_dumps\r\n    rv = dumps(obj, **kwargs) \\\r\n  File \"/Users/dstandish/.virtualenvs/scratch/lib/python3.7/site-packages/flask/json/__init__.py\", line 179, in dumps\r\n    rv = _json.dumps(obj, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/json/__init__.py\", line 238, in dumps\r\n    **kw).encode(obj)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/json/encoder.py\", line 199, in encode\r\n    chunks = self.iterencode(o, _one_shot=True)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/json/encoder.py\", line 257, in iterencode\r\n    return _iterencode(o, 0)\r\nTypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'str'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

we can access dag_run.conf in templates like so:\r\n```\r\n \"{{ dag_run.conf.get('abc', 'def_val') }}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if no conf is passed to the dag run, the above jinja template will fail upon rendering, because `conf` will be `None`.\r\n\r\nSo currently, to be safe, you have to do this:\r\n```\r\n \"{{ dag_run.conf and dag_run.conf.get('abc', 'def_val') }}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes DagRun model so that it returns an empty dictionary when there is no conf.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-07T22:59:01Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T20:24:25Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T20:24:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa0724d04c9087adf0aa1894aea0adc69ac4a073","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4737\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs described in the relevant issue and commit body, 50 characters is too conservative, as 100 might as well be. SQS names can be 80 characters long, which served as anchor for picking the next multiple of 50 that would suffice.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis change should be transparent and have no effect on existing features.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR is to add Sentry SDK functionality to Airflow. The functionality includes adding tags per task event and breadcrumbs of previous tasks that ran on the DAG. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-07T00:17:55Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T18:44:42Z","closed_at":"2019-06-11T18:44:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8f6a7a0f008d16c2248e6add1c503297bd83e38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/34056f8fd22b5d16822051a8f7d890090b684762","head":{"label":"tiopi:master","ref":"master","sha":"34056f8fd22b5d16822051a8f7d890090b684762","user":{"login":"tiopi","id":13202929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjAyOTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13202929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi","html_url":"https://github.com/tiopi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190629953,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA2Mjk5NTM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"tiopi/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tiopi","id":13202929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjAyOTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13202929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi","html_url":"https://github.com/tiopi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiopi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tiopi/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4740) \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA dag will accept, in its default_args, a `start_date` as simple as `2019-06-01`.  If it detects a string, it converts to a richer type ([code reference|https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/models/dag.py#L217-L221]). However, it will not accept a similar string for `end_date` instead an exception like this is thrown:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n File \"/airflow/tests/models/test_dag.py\", line 210, in test_dag_naive_start_end_dates_strings\r\n DAG('DAG', default_args={'start_date': '2019-06-01', 'end_date': '2019-06-05'})\r\n File \"/airflow/airflow/models/dag.py\", line 244, in __init__\r\n timezone.convert_to_utc(self.default_args['end_date'])\r\n File \"/airflow/airflow/utils/timezone.py\", line 92, in convert_to_utc\r\n if not is_localized(value):\r\n File \"/airflow/airflow/utils/timezone.py\", line 38, in is_localized\r\n return value.utcoffset() is not None\r\nAttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'utcoffset'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's a very confusing user experience.  `end_date` should be as permissive as `start_date`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds unit tests \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-06T17:30:42Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T15:22:51Z","closed_at":"2019-06-18T15:22:51Z","merged_at":"2019-06-18T15:22:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d3cbfd2ce7af1ef1bccd3a077d55e5a9e0b4044","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5381/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5381/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5381/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b7e6a3fe3f0330a29ffd0f4890e08ead8d6bb822","head":{"label":"dossett:AIRFLOW-4740","ref":"AIRFLOW-4740","sha":"b7e6a3fe3f0330a29ffd0f4890e08ead8d6bb822","user":{"login":"dossett","id":7207582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDc1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7207582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett","html_url":"https://github.com/dossett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":153471524,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTM0NzE1MjQ=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"dossett/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dossett","id":7207582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDc1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7207582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett","html_url":"https://github.com/dossett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dossett/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4739) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4739\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI want to be able to add arbitrary labels to an airflow worker pod.  For example, I want to specify this in the task definition:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun_this = PythonOperator(\r\ntask_id='print_the_context',\r\nprovide_context=True,\r\npython_callable=my_sleeping_function,\r\nexecutor_config={\"KubernetesExecutor\": {\"labels\":\r\n  {\"test\": \"label\"}\r\n}},\r\ndag=dag,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd have my worker pod have the label `test:label`. \r\n\r\nMy main use case for this is for auditing.  We audit our kubernetes cluster by tags, attributing cost based on how much resources the pod uses.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4518\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4364/files refactored GKEClusterHook's constructor but didn't update its callers, so GKEClusterCreateOperator and GkeClusterDeleteOperator no longer work. They pass the project ID in as the first arg to the hook constructor, which the hook interprets as a Connection ID.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4527) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Airflow with mysql as metastore. When there is a network issue, airflow tries to refresh status from db after completion of task and gets a connection error - This results in task getting stuck in running.\r\n\r\nIf worker nodes are unable to reach mysql to update task status, scheduler node should handle this scenario and mark those tasks failed. Tasks shouldn't be stuck in running state for ever.\r\n\r\nBelow is the stack trace, connection error with mysql has occured when refreshfromdb() is called in _run_raw_task after task completion. \r\n\r\n Scheduler heartbeat got an exception: (MySQLdb._exceptions.OperationalError) (2013, \"Lost connection to MySQL server at 'reading authorization packet', system error: 104\") (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/e3q8)\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data File \"/usr/local/bin/airflow\", line 32, in <module>\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/utils/cli.py\", line 74, in wrapper\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data return f(*args, **kwargs)\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/bin/cli.py\", line 526, in run\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data _run(args, dag, ti)\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/bin/cli.py\", line 445, in _run\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data pool=args.pool,\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/utils/db.py\", line 73, in wrapper\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data return func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\n**INFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/models.py\", line 1692, in _run_raw_task\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data self.refresh_from_db()\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}**\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/utils/db.py\", line 73, in wrapper\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data return func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n{base_task_runner.py:101}\r\nINFO - Job 989226: Subtask count_cust_shipped_data File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/models.py\", line 1218, in refresh_from_db\r\n\r\nI have made scheduler identify such tasks based on execution time out set for the task and marked them for RETRY or FAILED.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n       test_dag_run has unit test for this scenario\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\nMy PR addresses [[AIRFLOW-3057]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3057) - add macros that see only successful dags\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTwo new variables are added to template context: \r\n* `prev_execution_date_success`\r\n* `prev_start_date_success`.\r\n\r\nThese return the exec / start date for the same task in prior _successful_ dag run.   \r\n\r\nLazy evaluation is employed so that the query to look up prev_ti is not executed unless a templated field references the variable in question.\r\n\r\nTo enable the above, I added `state` as a param to `DagRun.get_previous_dagrun` and `TaskInstance._get_previous_ti`, and added properties `previous_ti_success` and `previous_execution_date_success` and `previous_start_date_success` to `TaskInstance`.  \r\n\r\n#### Notes on decisions \r\n\r\n##### Success of dag run vs success of TI\r\n\r\nThese new context variables e.g. `previous_execution_date_success` will return the execution date of the same TI in the prior successful dag run.  Alternatively, I could have had them return the dates for the prior successful TI.  \r\n\r\nI decided not to do that so that (1) no new indexes were required and (2) I could reuse the `get_previous_dagrun` method with only a small change.  The only time this would give a different result would be if a trigger rule allowed the dag run to be successful despite the task failing, or perhaps if a task was run manually without a dag run (not sure if this is possible?).  But these issues did not seem to justify the slightly more elaborate changes it would require.  In any case, I have made it clear in the docs that the execution date is derived from last successful dag run.\r\n\r\n##### Naming\r\nOn naming, I initially was going to do `previous_successful_X`, but then I saw the ticket that already existed for this issue, and they had suggested `previous_X_success`, and I thought that was maybe better anyway, so that's what I went with.  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Notes on less obvious changes\r\n\r\n##### _get_previous_ti\r\nPreviously this will call `get_previous_scheduled_dagrun` if `dag.catchup` and `get_previous_dagrun` otherwise.  The `scheduled` version is more efficient -- it just looks for one row, instead of pulling many and ordering and taking one.\r\nFor my change, even if `dag.catchup` is True, I want to use `get_previous_dagrun` if either `state`  is given or `schedule_interval is None`.  \r\nIf you are asking for state (in this case success), then you are not looking for merely previous scheduled dag run -- you want the previous one with state.  \r\nAnd if schedule interval is None (which could be true with dogs that are always externally triggered), then using `get_previous_scheduled_dagrun` won't find anything.\r\nYou could argue that if `dag.catchup` is True then we shouldn't be looking for previous successful or whatever.  But unless there is a very good reason, methods should do what they say they are going to do.\r\n\r\n##### get_previous_dagrun\r\nHere we just need to build filters dynamically because if state is not given then we don't want to add state to the filters.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nMy PR adds 4 new tests:\r\n* test_previous_ti\r\n* test_previous_ti_success\r\n* test_previous_execution_date_success\r\n* test_previous_start_date_success\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

many use cases it is neccessary to write data from a worker back to a PV to share it between other workers (e.g. for TFX). Therefore a new (third) PVC should be optionaly mounted into the worker nodes (as well as the webserver). The PVC has to be provided by the user (similiar to DAG and log PV). It has to be mounted with the ReadOnly flag off. \r\n\r\nAs this is very new to me, I am not sure if I did everything correct. I was not able to run all tests but it should not break anything as this is mainly a copy of the log PV. Also I am not sure if the mount also works for the webserver pod.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4722)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- Add a new parameter to add a new PV called airflow-data, which is mounted as writeable into a worker to allow sharing of data between workers.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- Sorry but I have no idea what to here :-/\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nUpdaded the default config with the new param. \r\n\r\n### Code

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn this PR I make 3 improvements to setup.py:\r\n\r\n1. It doesn't throw a warning \"UserWarning: The version specified ('2.0.0.dev0+') is an invalid version, this may not work as expected with newer versions of setuptools, pip, and PyPI. Please see PEP 440 for more details.\"\r\n\r\nNewer versions of setuptools expect PEP440 versioning and our version `2.0.0.dev0+` does not comply to that. Removed the + and now it is.\r\n\r\n2. It fixes the Sphinx-PyPI-upload dependency which was making setup.py crash when running \"python setup.py --help-commands\".\r\n\r\nRunning `python setup.py --help-commands` crashes setup.py (testing with Python 3.5 and 3.6):\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nairflow/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sphinx_pypi_upload.py\", line 61\r\n    raise DistutilsOptionError, \\\r\n```\r\n\r\nFound [this thread](https://bitbucket.org/jezdez/sphinx-pypi-upload/issues/4/syntax-error-in-python-33) and appears to be related to the super old Sphinx-PyPI-upload version we're using. Updated to Sphinx-PyPI-upload3 with newer version and no more crash.\r\n\r\n3. And it adds descriptions for the custom commands.\r\n\r\nThe custom commands now display descriptions:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython setup.py --help-commands\r\n...\r\nExtra commands:\r\n  extra_clean       Tidy up the project root\r\n  compile_assets    Compile and build the frontend assets\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n[Update]: AIRFLOW-4363\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIssue: When using the `docker_operator`, I experienced some issue while using Mac OS 10.14.4. The error was `json.JSONDecodeError`. After my investigation about this error, I found that there are several messages for logging aren't well separated, for example it contains `\\n` inside one single message which should be split into 2 to more different messages.\r\n\r\nWhat my PR do: add try-catch for reading to json, if it encounter `json.JSONDecodeError` again, we should either split by `\\n` and then find `status` to be logged or just print all the payload instead of throw an error just due to an non-critical issue like this.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4716\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWe have already captured per DAG loading time. We should expose this stat through StatsD for UI debugging purpose. And the cardinality of this stat is O(#DAG) which should be fine.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-31T05:10:31Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T06:41:28Z","closed_at":"2019-06-18T01:51:28Z","merged_at":"2019-06-18T01:51:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0f6a805c2d90720e97e48dda8a498096dec7571","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5375a9af21db970651c17f947558b6fc180f0dd3","head":{"label":"feng-tao:tfeng_add_timing","ref":"tfeng_add_timing","sha":"5375a9af21db970651c17f947558b6fc180f0dd3","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122814628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjI4MTQ2Mjg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"feng-tao/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4591\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\ntl;dl `non_pooled_task_slot_count` and `non_pooled_backfill_task_slot_count`\r\nare removed in favor of a real pool, e.g. `default_pool`.\r\n\r\nCurrently the number of running tasks that do not have a pool specified will be limited by `non_pooled_task_slot_count` or `non_pooled_backfill_task_slot_count` depends on the whether the task is triggered by scheduler or backfill. Conceptually it is a pool with slots specified through configuration but with a bit different implementation. This PR propose to make this pool a real pool, e.g. using the common implementation of pool so that the implementation can be simplified.\r\n\r\nBy default tasks are running in `default_pool`.\r\n`default_pool` is initialized with 128 slots and user can change the\r\nnumber of slots through UI/CLI. `default_pool` cannot be removed.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-30 at 6 23 23 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6065051/58679870-30a4b600-831a-11e9-84fc-dcf03da3c41b.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-30 at 6 26 15 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6065051/58679871-30a4b600-831a-11e9-8afa-40922850ec7b.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-31T03:28:35Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T11:28:09Z","closed_at":"2019-06-20T17:16:50Z","merged_at":"2019-06-20T17:16:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"2c99ec624bd66e9fa38e9f0087d46ef4d7f05aec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4f4f24b8a4d43caa31ffb8251e8c26309ec2b459","head":{"label":"milton0825:airflow-default-pool","ref":"airflow-default-pool","sha":"4f4f24b8a4d43caa31ffb8251e8c26309ec2b459","user":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171764273,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE3NjQyNzM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"milton0825/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"milton0825","id":6065051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNjUwNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6065051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825","html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/milton0825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/milton0825/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-4598](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4598)\r\n issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen using K8s executor, If a task pod terminates with non zero code, the task is marked as failed, even though its retry count is not exhausted. The section of code I am removing is responsible for marking the task as failed. Adding the (task,state) to event_buffer should take care of retrying in the _process_executor_events method in the Scheduler.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-30T15:06:47Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T08:49:33Z","closed_at":"2019-06-04T01:40:03Z","merged_at":"2019-06-04T01:40:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"89bc657553ba9e6096c0ddbb4803176950821d79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/832a1afafcd9c7a7eaf3241f9662859ba172db33","head":{"label":"andy-g14:AIRFLOW-4598","ref":"AIRFLOW-4598","sha":"832a1afafcd9c7a7eaf3241f9662859ba172db33","user":{"login":"andy-g14","id":11981810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTgxODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11981810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14","html_url":"https://github.com/andy-g14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176449203,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzY0NDkyMDM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"andy-g14/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andy-g14","id":11981810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTgxODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11981810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14","html_url":"https://github.com/andy-g14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andy-g14/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-4598](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4598)\r\n issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen using K8s executor, If a task pod terminates with non zero code, the task is marked as failed, even though its retry count is not exhausted. The section of code I am removing is responsible for marking the task as failed. Adding the (task,state) to event_buffer should take care of retrying in the _process_executor_events method in the Scheduler.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-30T14:05:36Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T15:03:46Z","closed_at":"2019-05-30T15:03:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"306dd9c4197960ea7d62946e56d05d796147a41d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5346/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5346/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5346/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/daed7a11060657c2d86f673de27f12e38b4b9c9d","head":{"label":"andy-g14:AIRFLOW-4598","ref":"AIRFLOW-4598","sha":"daed7a11060657c2d86f673de27f12e38b4b9c9d","user":{"login":"andy-g14","id":11981810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTgxODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11981810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14","html_url":"https://github.com/andy-g14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176449203,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzY0NDkyMDM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"andy-g14/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andy-g14","id":11981810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTgxODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11981810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14","html_url":"https://github.com/andy-g14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-g14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andy-g14/airflow","description":"Apache

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

A lot of the test code has changed significantly so it's possible that even if an issue was caused by this PR it has since been fixed.

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`settings.py` imports the contents of `airflow_local_settings.py` (which is expected to live under `$AIRFLOW_HOME/config`) before it is added to `sys.path`. Thus, unless `airflow_local_settings.py` is added manually to `PYTHONPATH` before execution, the module will not be found.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the `airflow_local_settings` module getting imported before `prepare_classpath()` is called, which is the function responsible for adding `DAGS_FOLDER`, `PLUGINS_FOLDER` and `$AIRFLOW_HOME/config` to `sys.path`.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the `airflow_local_settings` import code in `initialize()` after `prepare_classpath()` is called. Since we are now working in a function scope instead of the module's scope, `from module import *` is unavailable, so non-dunder contents of `airflow_local_settings` are added to the `settings` module `globals()` manually.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- test_import_local_settings_without_syspath\r\n- test_policy_function\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a .github/SECURITY.md file that defines the\r\ncontents of the \"Policy\" tab in the new \"Security\" section of\r\nthe GitHub interface.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Policy tab obtains its content from the\r\ndocs/security.rst file, which contains technical, non-policy\r\nrelated information. This commit retains the\r\n\"Reporting Vulnerabilities\" section of docs/security.rst, which\r\nis relevant, and strips the extraneous content.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nDocumentation only.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`settings.py` currently defines a `prepare_classpath()` function that ensures that certain subfolders in `AIRFLOW_HOME` are added to `sys.path`. The function's naming seems borrowed from Java, and thus could be improved by renaming it to `prepare_syspath()` which is the equivalent Python concept.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be an internal API that is only used in `settings.py` itself, so the change shouldn't have any impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR does not need extra tests as it is a trivial naming change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4205\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe supported typing in Python 2 with mypy & type comments. Now that\r\nwe're dropping Python 2 support, we can switch to native Python type hinting.\r\nWe support Python 3.5 which doesn't include variable type annotations\r\nyet, so only function arguments and return values are typed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes
