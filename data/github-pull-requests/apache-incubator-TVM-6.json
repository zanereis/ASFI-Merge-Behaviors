Representation\r\nThis commit extends `BufferLoad` and `BufferStore` to accept a predicate mask argument indicating which lanes in a vectorized buffer load/store should be read/written.\r\n\r\nAs a simple example, we can load all lanes:\r\n```\r\ntir.BufferLoad(buf, [tir.Ramp(0, 1, 8)], predicate=tir.Broadcast(1, 8))\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr disable loading all lanes:\r\n```\r\ntir.BufferLoad(buf, [tir.Ramp(0, 1, 8)], predicate=tir.Broadcast(0, 8))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn TVMScript, buffer loads and stores are currently displayed using a \"short-hand\" notation e.g. `A[0:4]`, but there was no clear path for extending this notation to support predicates. Therefore, the vload/vstore notation is used e.g. `A.vload([T.Ramp(0, 1, 4)], predicate=...)`. The TVMScript printer falls back to the vload/vstore notation whenever predicates are specified.\r\n\r\n### Creation\r\nBuffer-level predication becomes more motivating when combined with the `tir.get_active_lane_mask` intrinsic. It can be used to mask off lanes when the vectorized axis is not divisible by the vector length. A detailed example and rationale can be found in the [RFC](https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0104-scalable-vectors-in-tir.md#predication).\r\n\r\nPredicated buffer load/stores are created in the `VectorizeLoop` pass via `TryPredicateBufferAccesses`. This pass aims to convert block-level predicates e.g.\r\n```\r\nfor i_0 in T.serial(4):\r\n    for i_1 in T.vectorized(4):\r\n        if i_0 * 4 + i_1 < 14:\r\n            B[i_0 * 4 + i_1] = A[i_0 * 4 + i_1] + 1.0\r\n```\r\nto buffer-level predicates, e.g.\r\n```\r\nfor i_0 in T.serial(4):\r\n    predicate = T.get_active_lane_mask(\"int1x4\", i_0 * 4, 14)\r\n    A_load = T.meta_var(A.vload([T.Ramp(i_0 * 4, 1, 4)], predicate=predicate))\r\n    B.vstore([T.Ramp(i_0 * 4, 1, 4)], A_load, predicate=predicate)\r\n```\r\nIt takes a conservative approach for now, focussing only on expressions produced by the split scheduling primitive, but more complex expressions could be supported in the future.\r\n\r\n`TryPredicateBufferAccesses` can be explicitly enabled/disabled with the `tir.enable_buffer_level_predication` pass context option. By default it will be disabled, unless the target supports SVE, in which case it will be enabled by default.\r\n\r\n~Note: this commit depends on https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16965, so also

transforms.","created_at":"2024-04-30T18:44:29Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T14:45:40Z","closed_at":"2024-05-24T10:55:15Z","merged_at":"2024-05-24T10:55:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf2753eafd03cecbb6de2b500d5e049c62c54958","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16960/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16960/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16960/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/cf021a1dfc435590d9d5d8e0075746da01200940","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_ir_module_with_multiple_targets","ref":"relax_ir_module_with_multiple_targets","sha":"cf021a1dfc435590d9d5d8e0075746da01200940","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `dlight` scheduling rules were applied solely based on the global `tvm.target.Target.current()`.  However, a TIR PrimFunc may be annotated with the target, rather than using the global `Target.current()`.  In this case, the `dlight` scheduling may produce a scheduled PrimFunc that is not compatible with its target.  For example, using a thread binding to `\"threadIdx.x\"` on a CPU target.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `dlight` to check for a TIR PrimFunc's annotations when scheduling, matching the behavior of `tvm.build`.","created_at":"2024-04-30T18:42:08Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T20:18:07Z","closed_at":"2024-05-13T19:44:35Z","merged_at":"2024-05-13T19:44:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb242ec77bf1f6588c07bb530ee8a241dc2f814d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3a7b15a6ac7d62abf7ae7a44cd8f433ec29ebd98","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:dlight_check_for_target_func_attr","ref":"dlight_check_for_target_func_attr","sha":"3a7b15a6ac7d62abf7ae7a44cd8f433ec29ebd98","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

patch partly reverts the unification of scalable and non-scalable scheduling of conv2d NHWC for `arm_cpu` targets introduced in #16899.\r\n\r\nThe non-scalable schedule for float32 splits the N axis (corresponding to number of output channels) by 16 in both the unified and the nonunified schedule versions, and then additionally splits the inner partitions by 4 in only the nonunified version to which this patch is reverting (first added in #16106). The two versions' behaviour would be equivalent if none of the padding on the N axis was removed during lowering, however we allow for that to happen as it proved to increase performance for very small convolutions.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, there seems to be a regression in cases where the datatype is float32 and the number of output channels is greater than 16, a multiple of 4, and not a multiple of 16, because even with the removed padding the nonunified schedule is able to vectorise over 4 elements, while the unified version cannot vectorise over 16 elements anymore.\r\n\r\nSince all of the conv2d NHWC hybrid topi test cases used numbers of output channels either less than 16 or divisible by 16, this patch also adds a new case which falls in the aforementioned regression area.\r\n\r\ncc

changes of this pull request:\r\n\r\n- Change the fp8-related test `requires_cuda_compute_version` from 9 to 8.9 (since sm_89 ada architecture also supports fp8 tensor cores, which is the platform I have tested on).\r\n- Improve fp8 vector load/store capabilities; previously, TVM only supported float8x4/2/1 load, but this PR introduces support for float8x8/16 load.\r\n- Refactor the interface of `get_mma_intrin_group` and `get_mma_intrin` functions, as the prior implementation assumed that input A and input B were of the same datatype. However, fp8 tensor cores can process combinations like e5m2*e5m2, e5m2*e4m3, e4m3*e4m3, or e4m3*e5m2. **Note: This change may affect code in MLC that utilizes `get_mma_intrin_group`.**\r\n- Implement support for fp8 mma code generation and associated tests.\r\n\r\nCheck out the correctness:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import te\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport tvm.testing\r\nfrom

reported in #16877, shape inference performed during a Relax transformation may produce different results than shape inference performed during TVMScript parsing.  While Relax transformations call `Analyzer::MarkGlobalNonNegValue` for each shape expression, this is not provided during TVMScript parsing.  As a result, output shapes that are conditional on the sign of a variable may produce different results when simplifying.\r\n\r\nThis commit provides a partial resolution for this issue.  Where prior to this commit, the TVMScript parser generated a `tir.Var` for each symbolic variable, the TVMScript parser now provides a `tir.SizeVar` for symbolic variables that are defined in contexts that require a non-negative

to this commit, the `tvm.testing.parameter` utility defined a fixture with the default `scope=\"function\"`.  However, this prevents use of these parameters as arguments for other fixtures that are themselves cached using pytest.  Since these are parameters, not large values that would be expensive to compute, there is no downside to caching them at the pytest level.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the scope of fixtures generated using `tvm.testing.parameter` to use `scope=\"session\"` instead of the default `scope=\"function\"`.","created_at":"2024-04-25T19:59:13Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T20:21:39Z","closed_at":"2024-05-13T19:27:08Z","merged_at":"2024-05-13T19:27:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d4b9ea5c3a96143a4abb6996275fa61c9f28974","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/46a048331ca5d3721c26e984f226f60d8dc40372","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvm_testing_fixture_at_session_scope","ref":"tvm_testing_fixture_at_session_scope","sha":"46a048331ca5d3721c26e984f226f60d8dc40372","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

first, FuseOpsByPattern for Relax used a strategy to match maximal subgraph. \r\nBut this was changed in a previous PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15308. \r\nThe intention was to fix a bug: in FuseOpsByPattern, when two matched subgraph are intersected, they are incorrectly merged together. \r\nThe bug was fixed by returning only the first subgraph if multiple subgraph are intersected. \r\nThe solution successfully solved the problem described there, but unfortunately, resulted in a minimal subgraph match strategy, probably unexpected. \r\n\r\nLet me clarify with a compute graph as an example:\r\n```\r\nlv0 = R.matmul(x, y)\r\nlv1 = R.add(lv0, bias)\r\nlv2 = R.clip(lv1, -128, 127)\r\n```\r\nConsider this pattern: `matmul->add | matmul->add->clip`. It should match both `lv0+lv1` and `lv0+lv1+lv2`. The solution in the aforementioned PR matches only `lv0+lv1`. But a stategy to match all `lv0+lv1+lv2` is expected. \r\n\r\nThis bug has been fixed by checking, when two matched subgraph are intersected, whether they have an inclusion relationship(i.e. whether subgraph A is contained in subgraph B), and if they have, the larger one is retained.\r\n\r\ncc @wrongtest-intellif

commit introduces the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) tuner `PSOTuner` to AutoTVM, enhancing tuning efficiency by better exploring the configuration space compared to GATuner. Key additions include:\r\n\r\n### Major Changes:\r\n\r\n- **PSOTuner Implementation**: Implements the `PSOTuner` class using the PSO algorithm to manage particle initialization, position, velocity updates, and fitness evaluation for TVM tasks.\r\n- **Integration into AutoTVM**: The PSOTuner is now integrated into the AutoTVM tuner module, accessible like existing tuners such as `GATuner`.\r\n- **Test Cases**: Adds test cases to validate PSOTuner functionality and its effectiveness in various tuning scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Benefits:\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced Tuning Efficiency**: By leveraging PSO, which is known for its ability to find global optima in complex search spaces, the tuner is expected to provide better performance tuning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial implementation, and feedback on its performance and functionality is highly encouraged to further refine this tuner.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-22T14:41:30Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T15:02:25Z","closed_at":"2025-02-08T15:02:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66d35342945965a2da468b9ed0b5d57dc87e9a72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16917/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16917/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16917/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5ea9260bb2fded06d4921acc861a93ff30fabe3e","head":{"label":"Junyi-99:main","ref":"main","sha":"5ea9260bb2fded06d4921acc861a93ff30fabe3e","user":{"login":"Junyi-99","id":14367694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzY3Njk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14367694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99","html_url":"https://github.com/Junyi-99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":790081349,"node_id":"R_kgDOLxevRQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"Junyi-99/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Junyi-99","id":14367694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzY3Njk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14367694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99","html_url":"https://github.com/Junyi-99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Junyi-99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Junyi-99/tvm","description":"Open

Background:\r\nThis PR adds Marvell software runtime support as outlined in the pre-RFC here (refer to Phasing section, Phase 2): https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/prerfc-byoc-integrating-marvell-ml-ai-accelerator-to-the-tvm-byoc-framework/16155 \r\n\r\nOur initial PR added basic support for partitioning and compilation (https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16570). \r\n\r\nThis follow up PR integrates **mrvl-tmlc** (Marvell's ML compiler which generates MLIP ISA) and **mrvl-mlsim** which is a software simulator tool to simulate the MLIP hardware. This toolchain is hosted at our MarvellMLTools GitHub repo: https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/MarvellMLTools\r\n\r\n### Summary of Changes:\r\nThe **mrvl-tmlc** compiler is invoked during compile time to generate MLIP instructions which are embedded in the runtime. The runtime then invokes the **mrvl-mlsim** tool to process the input, simulate the MLIP ISA instructions and return the output to the TVM runtime.","created_at":"2024-04-22T04:30:04Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T09:51:36Z","closed_at":"2024-04-24T09:51:36Z","merged_at":"2024-04-24T09:51:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"5cf4ca6d150ae1a0c04272bba4e60d984a673288","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/157c61a76a386342d448c4179a71278c00d4d6bd","head":{"label":"f2013519:main","ref":"main","sha":"157c61a76a386342d448c4179a71278c00d4d6bd","user":{"login":"f2013519","id":31140965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQwOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31140965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519","html_url":"https://github.com/f2013519","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":754755990,"node_id":"R_kgDOLPyplg","name":"tvm","full_name":"f2013519/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"f2013519","id":31140965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQwOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31140965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519","html_url":"https://github.com/f2013519","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2013519/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/f2013519/tvm","description":"Open

are two changes in this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Change 1: Support `string[]` in `setPackedFunc()`\r\nPrior to this PR, we cannot pass in `string[]` from typescript to a TVM PackedFunc and need to convert it to `TVMArray<TVMString>` (for instance in `getParamsFromCacheByName()`). This may not be the most convenient if the PackedFunc's caller is not internal to tvmjs. Thus, this PR moves the conversion to `setPackedFunc()` instead.\r\n\r\n#### Change 2: Support exceptionally long TVM arrays\r\nThe second change is dealing with exceptionally long TVM arrays. In cases like passing in a token table, we need to pass in a long `string[]` (in Llama-3's case, of size 128000), leading to JS error `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` since we treat each string element as an argument, shown in `this.ctx.arrayMake(...inputs)`. \r\n\r\nThis PR sets an empirical call stack limit of 30000 and chunks the array elements in `makeTVMArray()`, converting each chunk to its own TVMArray. Then we concatenate them with the newly implemented `runtime.ArrayConcat` that concatenates N TVMArrays.\r\n\r\nTested end-to-end in WebLLM.","created_at":"2024-04-21T04:46:02Z","updated_at":"2024-04-21T21:40:27Z","closed_at":"2024-04-21T21:40:27Z","merged_at":"2024-04-21T21:40:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"57316dae1497c36ed57732a7a610018a990f1927","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d7d19108ff89c91ec4a899acc43c32dcbab932d5","head":{"label":"CharlieFRuan:pr-0421-web-string","ref":"pr-0421-web-string","sha":"d7d19108ff89c91ec4a899acc43c32dcbab932d5","user":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":717204711,"node_id":"R_kgDOKr-s5w","name":"tvm","full_name":"CharlieFRuan/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan/tvm","description":"Open

most IR types, neither `std::hash` nor `std::equal_to` are provided, as it would be ambiguous whether comparisons should be performed with reference equality or structural equality.  While this avoids ambiguity in the general case of nested structures, IR variables follow reference equality and are frequently used as lookup keys.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements a specialization of `std::hash` and `std::equal_to` for `tvm::GlobalVar`, `tvm::tir::Var`, and `tvm::relax::Var`.  This allows them to be used as lookup keys for `std::unordered_set` and `std::unordered_map` without explicitly specifying explicit `ObjectPtrHash` and `ObjectPtrEqual`.","created_at":"2024-04-20T20:12:13Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T20:18:34Z","closed_at":"2024-05-13T20:09:48Z","merged_at":"2024-05-13T20:09:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b5f8d0f774f70194fb643ff6164d29a150d234e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16909/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16909/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16909/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ce22674ae68cbbb2a5e4716ade6853a7f18478a5","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:qol_std_hash_and_equalto_for_variables","ref":"qol_std_hash_and_equalto_for_variables","sha":"ce22674ae68cbbb2a5e4716ade6853a7f18478a5","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

the Relax VM attempts to allocate more memory than is available on the GPU, it should raise an exception.  Prior to this commit, an out-of-memory exception instead triggered a segfault within `\"vm.builtin.alloc_storage\"`.\r\n\r\nWhen an allocation succeeds, the sequence of events is:\r\n\r\n1. A `StorageObj` instance is constructed.\r\n2. A call is made to `alloc->Alloc`, which returns the allocated buffer.\r\n3. The allocated buffer is assigned to `StorageObj::buffer`.\r\n4. The allocator is assigned to `StorageObj::allocator`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the GPU has insufficient memory, the sequence instead is:\r\n\r\n1. A `StorageObj` instance is constructed.\r\n2. A call is made to `alloc->Alloc`, which raises an out-of-memory exception.\r\n3. In unwinding the stack, the `StorageObj` destructor is called.\r\n4. The `StorageObj` destructor calls `allocator->Free(buffer)`.  Since neither `allocator` nor `buffer` have been defined, this causes a segfault.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements two independent fixes for this bug.\r\n\r\nFirst, the `\"vm.builtin.alloc_storage\"` function is reordered to call `alloc->Alloc(...)` before constructing the `StorageObj` instance.  If an exception is raised during the allocation, there is no `StorageObj` instance whose destructor must be called.\r\n\r\nSecond, the `StorageObj::allocator` field is initialized to `nullptr` by default, and the destructor only calls `allocator->Free` if the `allocator` is non-null.  This prevents a similar error from occurring at any other callsites that directly construct a

commit adds an `arm_cpu` conv2d NHWC schedule which generates SVE instructions by extending the hybrid GeMM approach implemented in #16106 to use scalable expressions as splitting factors.\r\n\r\nVarious vscale-related fixes needed to implement the schedule are also included, such as:\r\n\r\n - adding vscale bounds in the `ConstIntBoundAnalyzer` and `IntervalSetEvaluator`\r\n - simplifying `MinNode` and `MaxNode` that have scalable expression operands in `RewriteSimplifier`, which would appear when defining the shape of a buffer padded to be a multiple of vscale and in its respective buffer access indices (e.g. `C_1 = T.Buffer((1024 * (T.vscale() * 16 + 256 - 16 % T.vscale() * 16),), data=C)` instead of `C_1 = T.Buffer((1024 * (T.max(255, T.vscale() * 16 + 255 - 16 % T.vscale() * 16) + 1),), data=C)`)\r\n\r\nThe correctness of the new schedule is checked using a TOPI test, while the presence of generated SVE instructions is verified by a codegen_aarch64 test. The new rewrite_simplify rules are also covered by additional test cases.  \r\n\r\ncc @ekalda @lhutton1 @Lunderberg

commit replaces fp16 compute dtype and scale dtype by fp32 in cublas matmul.\r\n\r\nAccording to cuBLAS [docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/index.html#cublasltmatmul) there are two possible options for compute/scale dtype when input/output dtype is fp16:\r\n1. compute dtype is `fp16` and scale dtype is `fp16`\r\n2. compute dtype is `fp32` and scale dtype is `fp32`\r\n\r\nBy default, we use 1) in apache/tvm and 2) in octoml/tvm. This commit aligns different behaviour and set `fp32` as default.\r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @masahi

`b` does not. This PR enhances the estimation with arith::IntSet.\r\n\r\nWe introduce another TIR attribute `tir_non_negative_var` to indicate the non-negative TIR variables for memory planning use.\r\n\r\nA new

commit adds support for splitting via the compile-time unknown constant `vscale`. Two main changes are introduced; they are described below.\r\n\r\nThe split scheduling primitive has a new parameter disable_predication that allows the user to avoid introducing a block-level predicate when splitting with a factor of `vscale`. This feature is useful when schedule writers know that the loop they're splitting is a factor of the scalable vector length for their target. Otherwise, a predicate must be introduced due to the nature of `vscale`.\r\n\r\nCanProve has been extended to prove expressions that use multiple instances of `vscale`. Known possible scalar values of the `vscale` intrinsic are iterated over and substituted into the expression. If the expression holds true for each possible value, we can conclude the expression true. Currently only support for an SVE target has been added, but it is possible to extend to other targets as/when needed. If the analyzer becomes more powerful in the future and is able to deal with multiple instances of a symbolic value in an expression, this feature can be removed.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Elen Kalda

to this commit, the `relax::Tuple` constructor left the `struct_info_` field undefined.  This is inconsistent with other Relax leaf nodes, such as `relax::PrimValue`, `relax::Constant`, and `relax::ExternFunc`, which initialize their struct info on construction.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `relax::Tuple` constructor to define `struct_info_` as `TupleStructInfo`, if all fields have a known struct info.  If any field does not have a known struct info, the current behavior is kept, where `struct_info_` is constructed as `NullOpt`, and is later populated by the `relax::BlockBuilder`.","created_at":"2024-04-09T13:57:12Z","updated_at":"2024-04-17T15:59:08Z","closed_at":"2024-04-16T21:28:01Z","merged_at":"2024-04-16T21:28:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"460f6f1d3e1625882df701252234350f83aa6da1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16860/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16860/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16860/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/329b558d8bb9ed5aea171670c86f21e683e51410","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_qol_infer_tuple_struct_info_on_construction","ref":"relax_qol_infer_tuple_struct_info_on_construction","sha":"329b558d8bb9ed5aea171670c86f21e683e51410","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

Relax IR requires the `FunctionNode::body`, `IfNode::true_branch`, and `IfNode::false_branch` to be instances of `relax::SeqExpr`. If these Relax requirements are violated, correctly-implemented transformations may raise an exception\r\n(e.g. from `Downcast` in `Downcast<SeqExpr>(func->body)->blocks`), or even segfault (e.g. when `.as` returns a nullptr in `func->body.as<SeqExprNode>()->blocks`).  Debugging these failure modes is also difficult, as even the TVMScript printer relies on the body of the function being a `SeqExprNode`.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the C++ type of `FunctionNode::body`, `IfNode::true_branch`, and `IfNode::false_branch` to be `relax::SeqExpr` instead of `relax::Expr`.  This does not impact any well-formed Relax IR, and allows this type of ill-formed Relax IR type to be checked at compile-time.  A large number of checks applied during TVM runtime can now be removed, as they duplicate the new compile-time check.\r\n\r\nTo maintain backwards compatibility, this commit adds a new constructor to `relax::SeqExpr`, which accepts a single `Expr body` argument.  This constructor provides either an additional reference to the same underlying `relax::SeqExprNode`, if `body` already contains a `relax::SeqExprNode`, and otherwise wraps the body in a `relax::SeqExpr`.  For implementations that previously produced well-formed Relax IR, this change has no effect.  For implementations that previously produced ill-formed Relax IR, this change results in the equivalent well-formed Relax IR.\r\n\r\nAlternate implementations considered:\r\n\r\n* Perform the backwards-compatibility wrapping within the `relax::Function` and `relax::If` constructors.  While this would provide the intended conversion when these constructors are used, Relax transforms make frequent use of copy-on-write (e.g. `func.CopyOnWrite()->body = new_body`), which does not use the constructor.  Maintaining backwards compatibility for this usage requires the implicit conversion constructor that was chosen for this PR.\r\n\r\n* Remove the Relax IR requirement for these expressions to be `SeqExpr`.  While this would make Relax more internally consistent, such a change would break backwards compatibility that relies on `SeqExpr` being present.  While the callsites within TVM could be updated to resolve this breakage, callsites outside of TVM (e.g. MLC-LLM) could not.  Exposing the special case within the C++ type, as done in this PR, maintains backwards compatibility.","created_at":"2024-04-09T13:56:09Z","updated_at":"2024-04-20T11:44:51Z","closed_at":"2024-04-20T08:15:52Z","merged_at":"2024-04-20T08:15:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"a2511cc5160fa73131517515c79144bef7f4b076","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16859/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16859/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16859/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0abd15459466bb388c0134b2432f56cf96d1e881","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_qol_seqexpr_in_cpp_type","ref":"relax_qol_seqexpr_in_cpp_type","sha":"0abd15459466bb388c0134b2432f56cf96d1e881","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open
