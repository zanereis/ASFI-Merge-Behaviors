Therefore,  I kept the old expr->expr API as well.\r\n    - Some passes, such as `FreeVars` etc, are not transformation but analysis. I added an `analysis.h` file for them.\r\n    - Theoretically, `analysis` should be also baked into the pass infra. For example, we could register some attributes to preserve validation and other information for an expression/module. Other passes then can directly get the preserved analysis results without specifically invoking these passes.\r\n\r\n- Removed the frontend ir_pass.py file and put the functions in either transform or analysis.\r\n\r\n- Corresponding changes are made in the following positions for cleanup:\r\n    - [x] C++ files that uses `pass.h`\r\n    - [x] Python unit test\r\n    - [x] Python frontends\r\n    -

I changed the current `AllocTensor` instruction to `AllocTensorReg` instruction for dynamic shape allocation, and add `AllocTensor` instruction for const shape. Current every `AllocTensor` requires a `LoadConst` instruction before, which I think significantly increases the number of instructions and reduces the readability. Therefore I think it's better to have both `AllocTensor` and `AllocTensorReg` instruction.\r\n2. I updated the VM instruction printer so that it's easier to understand.\r\n3.

the sub-function after fusion will have 32-bit output, instead of 8-bit output, which has larger memory access overhead.\r\nIn such case, it is better to create a copy of

the BindVar function does not take Var type into account. This causes\r\ntwo same graph structures with different var shapes to have same hash.\r\nStructural hash is used for keeping track of which operators we have\r\nalready compiled.

there are some discussions about how to leverage an additional pass to annotate a Relay program for heterogeneous compilation. This PR adds a unit test to show it and it slightly changes the manual way for annotation. Now users need to connect nodes but don't need to pass the annotation exprs to the backend.\r\n\r\nThis following example has been executed locally:\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\nimport tvm.relay.testing\r\nfrom tvm.relay.expr_functor import ExprMutator\r\n\r\nclass ScheduleConv2d(ExprMutator):\r\n    def __init__(self, device):\r\n        self.device = device\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n\r\n    def visit_call(self, expr):\r\n        visit = super().visit_call(expr)\r\n        if expr.op == tvm.relay.op.get(\"nn.conv2d\"):\r\n            return relay.annotation.on_device(visit, self.device)\r\n        else:\r\n            return visit\r\n\r\ndef schedule_conv2d_on_gpu(expr):\r\n    sched = ScheduleConv2d(tvm.gpu(0))\r\n    return sched.visit(expr)\r\n\r\nresnet, params = relay.testing.resnet.get_workload()\r\nresnet = schedule_conv2d_on_gpu(resnet)\r\nresnet = relay.ir_pass.infer_type(resnet)\r\n\r\ntarget = {\"gpu\":

ergonomic changes to make API cleaner and easy to use.\r\n\r\n- directly use ptr in operator->\r\n- Remove the positional constructor of PassContext in C++, instead allow the creation of a default one and mutate the corresponding fields. (This allows arguments to be explicit, like keyword arguments). This is done given that we might grow the PassContext in the future.\r\n```c++\r\n auto ctx = PassContext::Create();\r\n ctx->opt_level = 2;\r\n ctx->fallback_device = kDLCPU;\r\n  With<PassContext> scope(ctx);\r\n  // pass context in effect.\r\n```\r\n- Add overload of operator() to Pass as well, so we can directly do seq(mod)\r\n- Remove LOG(INFO), use ```DLOG(INFO)``` for debug

is a draft PR to:\r\n\r\n- [x] Merge `BuildConfig` and `PassContext` in both Python and C++ as `BuildConfig` is mainly used for managing pass configs. Python side is done. C++ `BuildConfig` will be replaced by `PassContext` when we start migrating `optimize` in `build_module` which is the next task.\r\n- [x] Make pass manager be able to execute passes using `with` statement where configs like `opt_level` and `disabled_passes` are specified, as pointed out in #3202 \r\n- [x] Alter `Sequential` API to support `with` syntax.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, we should be able to test the given example once the passes are registered with `Pass MyPass(xxx)`.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @jroesch, @MarisaKirisame @wweic

In the case of a full model, the right way to get layerwise timing is to let the model run continuously with minimal interruptions for a fixed amount of time, and then take the average to get the runtime of individual layers.\r\n\r\n@icemelon9 and @antinucleon  please

This PR aims to provide a unified API for the RAII scoping similar to python's with syntax.\r\n\r\nAny context class needs to implement set of standard functions to be implemented by a context class,

never defined the semantics of an incomplete match in Relay, so I've written a fairly simple function to check whether a match is complete (there's probably a better algorithm, but this one also concretely finds all cases that are not handled) and added into the type checker.\r\n\r\n~This did require me to change several functions that relied on having incomplete matches, such as `hd` and `tl`. I do not think we should permit partial functions, as that would require us to define semantics for incomplete matches and potentially, down the line, to complicate the language with other kinds of error handling that could be placed higher in the stack (e.g., it would be a problem if some execution settings for Relay had one kind of error for incomplete matches and others reported the error a different way).~\r\n\r\n~I suppose, though, that it would be easy to change the match incompleteness to a warning rather than an error if we really do want to keep `hd`, `tl`, etc.~\r\n\r\nIncomplete matches only generate a warning for now, though we may want to add flags to make this an error later, see @MarisaKirisame's comment
