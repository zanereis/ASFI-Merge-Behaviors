adding HUDI metadata field to schema, the position of incoming schema fields is retained. This allows us to lookup fields in exiting record and assign to the new record using field positions (array index lookup). This is faster than looking up fields using name (HashMap based lookup).\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nSmall performance improvement for rewriting records during the ingestion phase. [HUDI-797](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-797) as the details on the usecase and improvements. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Modified HoodieAvroUtils.addMetadataFields to retain the field positions.\r\n2. Added a new rewriting function HoodieAvroUtils.rewriteHoodieRecord which rewrites using field positions rather than field names.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change is verified automatically by all the HUDI client tests which ingest data into HUDI.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAvro schema that is generated from Spark Dataframe (after SQL transformation) has incorrect defaults. Order of types is wrong (\"null\" must be first) and default is not set. If makes every schema change incompatible, which is only affecting compactions. \r\n\r\nThis one is a reference PR. The solution is a bit hacky as I modify schema in place using reflection, there is probably a safer way to rebuild the schema. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added HoodieAvroUtils.rewriteIncorrectDefaults\r\n  - Updated AvroConversionHelper and AvroConversionUtils to use it after SchemaConverters.toAvroType\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAdded test to HoodieAvroUtilsTest to verify rewriter works properly.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis is part of code changes needed to support RFC-12 to support efficient bootstrap of legacy tables. This PR contains 2 commits\r\n\r\n  * HUDI-418 - Bootstrap Index using HFile with APIs to create and lookup. Note that this implementation is different from what was initially proposed in RFC-12. This implementation uses existing HFile layout as this layout works well for our usecase and the implementation is battle tested and stable. There are 2 HFiles maintained - one for storing all bootstrap mappings at partition level (for all file-system view calls) and another at per file-id level (for compaction lookups)\r\n   * HUDI-421 Core Changes in File System View to integrate with Bootstrap Index. With this change the upper layers which uses FileSystem View can easily identify and handle external base-files.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title &

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHUDI specific validation of schema evolution should ensure that a newer schema can be used for the dataset by checking that the data written using the old schema can be read using the new schema.\r\n\r\nPlease see [HUDI-741 ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-741) for my detailed analysis of why this is required and how this is implemented.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n\r\n1. Added a new config in HoodieWriteConfig to enable schema validation check (disabled by default)\r\n2. Moved code that reads schema from base/log files into hudi-common from hudi-hive-sync\r\n3. Added a class org.apache.hudi.common.util.SchemaCompatibility which implements checks for schema evolution. This is based on org.apache.avro.SchemaCompatibility but performs HUDI specific checks.\r\n\r\nTesting changes:\r\n\r\n4. Extended HoodieTestDataGenerator to generate records using a custom Schema\r\n5. Extended TestHoodieClientBase to add insertBatch API which allows inserting a new batch of unique records into a HUDI table\r\n6. Added a unit test to verify schema evolution for both COW and MOR tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added unit test

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWe have TimestampBasedKeyGenerator for defining custom partition paths and we have ComplexKeyGenerator for supporting having combination of fields as record key or partition key. \r\n \r\nHowever we do not have support for the case where one wants to have combination of fields as record key along with being able to define custom partition paths. \r\nThis PR aims to give a generic implementation where we can define key generator for every field in partition path. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduced PartitionKeyType in KeyGenerator, also added 2 new functions \r\nString getPartitionPath(GenericRecord record, String partitionPathField)\r\nString getRecordKey(GenericRecord record)\r\n\r\n- Introduced a new class CustomKeyGenerator which accepts input for partition path field in form -> field1:PartitionKeyType1,field2:PartitionKeyType2\r\n\r\n- All the corner cases have been handled. Added a test class TestCustomKeyGenerator with only one test case for now. Will be adding more. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.","created_at":"2020-03-21T09:20:33Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T11:35:08Z","closed_at":"2020-07-09T11:35:07Z","merged_at":"2020-07-09T11:35:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7f1a781ab4ff3784d53a102364fd85e379811d1","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/f3094f6ca1dd43f263f9005291861321fb58b24a","head":{"label":"pratyakshsharma:hudi-728","ref":"hudi-728","sha":"f3094f6ca1dd43f263f9005291861321fb58b24a","user":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODYzNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30863489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma","html_url":"https://github.com/pratyakshsharma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratyakshsharma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203180635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDMxODA2MzU=","name":"incubator-hudi","full_name":"pratyakshsharma/incubator-hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pratyakshsharma","id":30863489,"nod

pull request\r\n\r\nJust before actually writing record to Hudi dataset, we try to rewrite record with new Avro schema which has Hudi metadata columns.
